Title = {Augmenting Smart Contract Decompiler Output Through Fine-Grained
   Dependency Analysis and LLM-Facilitated Semantic Recovery},

Abstract = {Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively
   employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program
   comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity
   smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in
   reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck
   of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate function identification,
   incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These
   deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program
   logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new
   framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis
   (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the
   complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow
   analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically,
   SmartHalo constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to
   extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to
   create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM
   outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification.
   Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart
   contract functions shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the
   quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g.,
   Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o mini with SmartHalo further
   enhances its performance, achieving a precision of 91.32\% and a recall
   of 87.38\% for function boundaries, a precision of 90.40\% and a recall
   of 88.82\% for variable types, and a precision of 80.66\% and a recall
   of 91.78\% for contract attributes.},

Title = {Interactive End-to-End Decompilation via Large Language Models},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {14},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {The goal of decompilation is to convert compiled low-level code (e.g.,
   assembly code) back into high-level programming languages, enabling
   analysis in scenarios where source code is unavailable. This task
   supports various reverse engineering applications, such as vulnerability
   identification, malware analysis, and legacy software migration. The
   end-to-end decompilation method based on large language models (LLMs)
   reduces reliance on additional tools and minimizes manual intervention
   due to its inherent properties. However, previous end-to-end methods
   often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control
   flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it
   challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these
   issues, we propose the ReF Decompile method, which incorporates the
   following innovations: (1) The Relabeling strategy replaces jump target
   addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function
   Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable
   information from binary files. Experimental results on the
   Humaneval-Decompile Benchmark demonstrate that ReF Decompile surpasses
   comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of
   61.43\%.},

Title = {Automatically Mitigating Vulnerabilities in Binary Programs via
   Partially Recompilable Decompilation},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {22},

Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Vulnerabilities are challenging to locate and repair, especially when
   source code is unavailable and binary patching is required. Manual
   methods are time-consuming, require significant expertise, and do not
   scale to the rate at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. Automated
   methods are an attractive alternative, and we propose Partially
   Recompilable Decompilation (PRD) to help automate the process. PRD lifts
   suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or
   review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level
   techniques. Although decompilation and recompilation do not typically
   succeed on an entire binary, our approach does because it is limited to
   a few functions, such as those identified by our binary fault
   localization. We evaluate the assumptions underlying our approach and
   find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, up to 79\%
   of individual functions are successfully decompiled and recompiled. In
   comparison, only 1.7\% of the full C-binaries succeed. When
   recompilation succeeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 93.0\% of
   the time. We evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process
   incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; and
   human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand
   Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating
   only on binaries, perform as well as, and sometimes better than
   full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a
   success rate consistent with the same tools operating with access to the
   entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning
   CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those
   produced by top CGC teams. For generality, the evaluation includes two
   independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world
   binaries.},

Title = {Binary-Source Code Matching Based on Decompilation Techniques and Graph
   Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {253-268},
Abstract = {Recent approaches to binary-source code matching often operate at the
   intermediate representation (IR) level, with some applying the matching
   process at the binary level by compiling the source code to binary and
   then matching it directly with the binary code. Others, though less
   common, perform matching at the decompiler-generated pseudo-code level
   by first decompiling the binary code into pseudo-code and then comparing
   it with the source code. However, all these approaches are limited by
   the loss of semantic information in the original source code and the
   introduction of noise during compilation and decompilation, making
   accurate matching challenging and often requiring specialized expertise.
   To address these limitations, this study introduces a system for
   binary-source code matching based on decompilation techniques and Graph
   analysis (BSMDG) that matches binary code with source code at the source
   code level. Our method utilizes the Ghidra decompiler in conjunction
   with a custom-built transpiler to reconstruct highlevel C++ source code
   from binary executables. Subsequently, call graphs (CGs) and control
   flow graphs (CFGs) are generated for both the original and translated
   code to evaluate their structural and semantic similarities. To evaluate
   our system, we used a curated dataset of C++ source code and
   corresponding binary files collected from the AtCoder website for
   training and testing. Additionally, a case study was conducted using the
   widely recognized POJ-104 benchmark dataset to assess the system's
   generalizability. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining
   decompilation with graph-based analysis, with our system achieving 90\%
   accuracy on POJ-104, highlighting its potential in code clone detection,
   vulnerability identification, and reverse engineering tasks.},

Abstract = {Decompilation is a widely utilized technique in reverse engineering,
   aimed at restoring binary code to human-readable high-level language
   code. However, the readability of the output from traditional
   decompilers is often poor. With advancements in language models, several
   learning-based decompilation methods have emerged. Nevertheless, the
   probabilistic nature of language models leads to outputs whose
   correctness cannot be guaranteed, necessitating further analysis by
   engineers to identify the corresponding functionality of the code.
   Inspired by compiler toolchains, we propose a novel approach to enhance
   the effectiveness of language models in decompilation tasks. Traditional
   rule-based methods and learning-based techniques are fused together in
   our approach, drawing insights from both paradigms. Specifically, we
   present a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model called IRaDT tailored
   to refine decompilation outputs at the intermediate representation
   level. Through this hybridization, we aim to address the limitations of
   existing methodologies and achieve more accurate and robust
   decompilation. We construct a diverse decompilation dataset targeting IR
   and evaluated IRaDT based on this dataset. The experimental results
   indicate that IRaDT has the ability to improve the readability of IR
   while ensuring its compileability, achieving a 74\% improvement compared
   to RetDec and a 93\% improvement compared to ChatGPT.},

Title = {On the use of statistical machine translation for suggesting variable
   names for decompiled code: The Pharo case},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER LANGUAGES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {79},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Adequately selecting variable names is a difficult activity for
   practitioners. In 2018, Jaffe et al. proposed the use of statistical
   machine translation (SMT) to suggest descriptive variable names for
   decompiled code. A large corpus of decompiled C code was used to train
   the SMT model. Our paper presents the results of a partial replication
   of Jaffe's experiment. We apply the same technique and methodology to a
   dataset made of code written in the Pharo programming language. We
   selected Pharo since its syntax is simple - it fits on half of a
   postcard - and because the optimizations performed by the compiler are
   limited to method scope. Our results indicate that SMT may recover
   between 8.9\% and 69.88\% of the variable names depending on the
   training set. Our replication concludes that: (i) the accuracy depends
   on the code similarity between the training and testing sets; (ii) the
   simplicity of the Pharo syntax and the satisfactory decompiled code
   alignment have a positive impact on predicting variable names; and (iii)
   a relatively small code corpus is sufficient to train the SMT model,
   which shows the applicability of the approach to less popular
   programming languages. Additionally, to assess SMT's potential in
   improving original variable names, ten Pharo developers reviewed 400 SMT
   name suggestions, with four reviews per variable. Only 15 suggestions
   (3.75\%) were unanimously viewed as improvements, while 45 (11.25\%)
   were perceived as improvements by at least two reviewers, highlighting
   SMT's limitations in providing suitable alternatives.},

Abstract = {Java decompilers are programs that perform the reverse process of Java
   compilers, i.e., they translate Java bytecode to Java source code. They
   are essential for reverse engineering purposes and have become more
   sophisticated and reliable over the years. However, it remains
   challenging for modern Java decompilers to reliably perform correct
   decompilation on real-world programs. To shed light on the key
   challenges of Java decompilation, this paper provides the first
   systematic study on the characteristics and causes of bugs in mature,
   widely-used Java decompilers. We conduct the study by investigating 333
   unique bugs from three popular Java decompilers. Our key findings and
   observations include: (1) Although most of the reported bugs were found
   when decompiling large, real-world code, 40.2\% of them have small test
   cases for bug reproduction; (2) Over 80\% of the bugs manifest as
   exceptions, syntactic errors, or semantic errors, and bugs with source
   code artifacts are very likely semantic errors; (3) 57.7\%, 39.0\%, and
   41.1\% of the bugs respectively are attributed to three stages of
   decompilers-loading structure entities from bytecode, optimizing these
   entities, and generating source code from these entities; (4) Bugs in
   decompilers' type inference are the most complex to fix; and (5) Region
   restoration for structures like loop, sugaring for special structures
   like switch, and type inference of variables of generic types or
   indistinguishable types are the three most significant challenges in
   Java decompilation, which to some extent explains our findings in (3)
   and (4).
   Based on these findings, we present JD-Tester, a differential testing
   framework for Java decompilers, and our experience of using it in
   testing the three popular Java decompilers. JD-Tester utilizes different
   Java program generators to construct executable Java tests and finds
   exceptions, syntactic, and semantic inconsistencies (i.e. bugs) between
   a generated test and its compiled-decompiled version (through
   compilation and execution). In total, we have found 62 bugs in the three
   decompilers, demonstrating both the effectiveness of JD-Tester, and the
   importance of testing and validating Java decompilers.},

Title = {From Control Application to Control Logic: PLC Decompile Framework for
   Industrial Control System},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {8685-8700},
Abstract = {Industrial Control System (ICS) depends on the underlying Programmable
   Logical Controllers (PLCs) to run. As such, the security of the internal
   control logic of the PLCs is the top concern of ICS. Reversing analysis
   and forensic work against PLC require extracting control logic from the
   control application running inside PLC, which is still an unresolved
   problem. To address the challenge, we propose a PLC decompile framework
   named CLEVER, which can analyze the control application and extract the
   control logic. First, we propose a simulation execution based code
   extraction method, which is utilized to filter the control logic related
   data. Then, to normalize the control application decompile process, an
   intermediate representation (IR) is designed, which can simplify the
   analysis process and enhance the extensibility of CLEVER. Finally, a
   heuristic data flow analysis algorithm is proposed to find variable
   dependency, and a sequential parsing method is utilized to reconstruct
   the source code from the control application. To evaluate our work, real
   world PLC hardware and programming software are used for the experiment.
   We use 22 real-world, 58 hand-written, and 150 auto-generated control
   applications to demonstrate the usability, correctness, and operational
   efficiency of CLEVER.},

Title = {E-APK: Energy pattern detection in decompiled android applications},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER LANGUAGES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {76},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Energy efficiency is a non-functional requirement that developers must
   consider, particularly when building software for battery-operated
   devices like mobile ones: a long-lasting battery is an essential
   requirement for an enjoyable user experience.In previous studies, it has
   been shown that many mobile applications include inefficiencies that
   cause battery to be drained faster than necessary. Some of these
   inefficiencies result from software patterns that have been catalogued,
   and for which more energy-efficient alternatives are also known.The
   existing catalogues, however, assume as a fundamental requirement that
   one has access to the source code of an application in order to be able
   to analyse it. This requirement makes independent energy analysis
   challenging, or even impossible, e.g. for a mobile user or, most
   significantly, an App Store trying to provide information on how
   efficient an application being submitted for publication is.We study the
   viability of looking for known energy patterns in applications by
   decompiling them and analysing the resulting code. For this, we
   decompiled and analysed 420 open-source applications by extending an
   existing tool, which is now capable of transparently decompiling and
   analysing android applications. With the collected data, we performed a
   comparative study of the presence of four energy patterns between the
   source code and the decompiled code.We performed two types of analysis:
   (i) comparing the total number of energy pattern detections; (ii)
   comparing the similarity between energy pattern detections. When
   comparing the total number of detections in source code against
   decompiled code, we found that 79.29\% of the applications reported the
   same number of energy pattern detections.To test the similarity between
   source code and APKs, we calculated, for each application, a similarity
   score based on our four implemented detectors. Of all applications,
   35.76\% achieved a perfect similarity score of 4, and 89.40\% got a
   score of 3 or more out of 4. Furthermore, only two applications got a
   score of 0.When viewed in tandem, the results of the two analyses we
   performed point in a promising direction. They provide initial evidence
   that static analysis techniques, typically used in source code, can be a
   viable method to inspect APKs when access to source code is restricted,
   and further research in this area is worthwhile.},

Title = {Loop Rerolling for Hardware Decompilation},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {PLDI},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {We introduce the new problem of hardware decompilation. Analogous to
   software decompilation, hardware decompilation is about analyzing a
   low-level artifact-in this case a netlist, i.e., a graph of wires and
   logical gates representing a digital circuit-in order to recover
   higher-level programming abstractions, and using those abstractions to
   generate code written in a hardware description language (HDL). The
   overall problem of hardware decompilation requires a number of pieces.
   In this paper we focus on one specific piece of the puzzle: a technique
   we call hardware loop rerolling. Hardware loop rerolling leverages clone
   detection and program synthesis techniques to identify repeated logic in
   netlists (such as would be synthesized from loops in the original HDL
   code) and reroll them into syntactic loops in the recovered HDL code. We
   evaluate hardware loop rerolling for hardware decompilation over a set
   of hardware design benchmarks written in the PyRTL HDL and industry
   standard SystemVerilog. Our implementation identifies and rerolls loops
   in 52 out of 53 of the netlists in our benchmark suite, and we show
   three examples of how hardware decompilation can provide concrete
   benefits: transpilation between HDLs, faster simulation times over
   netlists (with mean speedup of 6x), and artifact compaction (39\%
   smaller on average).},

Abstract = {JNI programs are widely used thanks to the combined benefits of C and
   Java programs. However, because understanding the interaction behaviors
   between two different programming languages is challenging, JNI program
   development is difficult to get right and vulnerable to security
   attacks. Thus, researchers have proposed static analysis of JNI program
   source code to detect bugs and security vulnerabilities in JNI programs.
   Unfortunately, such source code analysis is not applicable to compiled
   JNI programs that are not open-sourced or open-source JNI programs
   containing third-party binary libraries. While JN-SAF, the
   state-of-the-art analyzer for compiled JNI programs, can analyze binary
   code, it has several limitations due to its symbolic execution and
   summary-based bottom-up analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel
   approach to statically analyze compiled JNI programs without their
   source code using binary decompilation. Unlike JN-SAF that analyzes
   binaries directly, our approach decompiles binaries and analyzes JNI
   programs with the decompiled binaries using an existing JNI program
   analyzer for source code. To decompile binaries to compilable C source
   code with precise JNI-interoperation-related types, we improve an
   existing decompilation tool by leveraging the characteristics of JNI
   programs. Our evaluation shows that the approach is precise as almost
   the same as the state-of-the-art JNI program analyzer for source code,
   and more precise than JN-SAF.},

Abstract = {The decompiler is one of the most common tools for examining executable
   binaries without the corresponding source code. It transforms binaries
   into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Unfortunately,
   decompiler output is far from readable because the decompilation process
   is often incomplete. State-of-the-art techniques use machine learning to
   predict missing information like variable names. While these approaches
   are often able to suggest good variable names in context, no existing
   work examines how the selection of training data influences these
   machine learning models. We investigate how data provenance and the
   quality of training data affect performance, and how well, if at all,
   trained models generalize across software domains. We focus on the
   variable renaming problem using one such machine learning model, DIRE.
   We first describe DIRE in detail and the accompanying technique used to
   generate training data from raw code. We also evaluate DIRE's overall
   performance without respect to data quality. Next, we show how training
   on more popular, possibly higher quality code (measured using GitHub
   stars) leads to a more generalizable model because popular code tends to
   have more diverse variable names. Finally, we evaluate how well DIRE
   predicts domain-specific identifiers, propose a modification to
   incorporate domain information, and show that it can predict identifiers
   in domain-specific scenarios 23\% more frequently than the original DIRE

Title = {Android decompiler performance on benign and malicious apps: an
   empirical study},
Journal = {EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Decompilers are indispensable tools in Android malware analysis and app
   security auditing. Numerous academic works also employ an Android
   decompiler as the first step in a program analysis pipeline. In such
   settings, decompilation is frequently regarded as a ``solved{''}
   problem, in that it is simply expected that source code can be
   accurately recovered from an app. On the other hand, it is known that,
   e.g, obfuscation can negatively impact a decompiler's effectiveness.
   Therefore, in order to better understand potential failure modes of,
   e.g., automated analysis pipelines involving decompilation, it is
   important to characterize the performance of decompilers on both benign
   and malicious apps. To this end, we have performed what is, to the best
   of our knowledge, the first large-scale study of Android decompilation
   failure rates, using three sets of apps; namely, 3,018 open-source apps,
   13,601 apps crawled from Google Play, and an existing collection of
   24,553 malware samples. In addition to the state-of-the-art Dalvik
   bytecode decompiler Jadx, we also studied the performance of three
   popular Java decompilers. Furthermore, this paper also presents the
   findings from a follow-up study on 54,945 malware apps, where we
   additionally performed an analysis of the reasons for decompilation
   failures. Our study revealed that decompilers generally have very low
   failure rates, and that few failures on benign apps appear to be related
   to obfuscation. On malware, however, obfuscation appears to be a more
   prominent cause of failures, although the vast majority of malicious
   apps could still be fully decompiled by an ensemble of decompilers.},

Title = {BinVulDet: Detecting vulnerability in binary program via decompiled
   pseudo code and BiLSTM-attention},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {125},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Static detection of security vulnerabilities in binary programs is an
   important research field in software supply chain security. However,
   existing vulnerability detection methods based on code similarity can
   only detect known vulnerabilities. Vulnerability features generated by
   vulnerability pattern-based detec-tion methods are low robust due to the
   influence of manually defined patterns, compiler diversity, and
   irrelevant function instructions. In this paper, we propose BinVulDet,
   which is a binary level vulnerability detection tool for accurate known
   and unknown vulnerability detection. BinVulDet uses decompilation
   techniques to obtain pseudo code containing high-level semantic
   information against the impact of com-pilation diversity. Then the
   program slicing technique is used to extract the statements with data
   depen-dencies and control dependencies related to the vulnerability. A
   BiLSTM-attention neural network is used to extract rich contextual
   semantic information from slice codes to generate more robust
   vulnerability patterns to detect vulnerabilities. The experimental
   results show that BinVulDet outperforms the state-of-the-art binary
   vulnerability detection methods. The FPR and FNR of BinVulDet are 1.04\%
   and 0.89\% on average, respectively, which are 3.93\% and 22.86\% lower
   than the baseline model on average. BinVulDet can effectively against
   the influence of compilation diversity and successfully be used for
   real-world vul-nerability detection by being evaluated in three CVE
   vulnerability projects.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Elipmoc: Advanced Decompilation of Ethereum Smart Contracts},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Number = {OOPSLA},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain greatly benefit from
   cutting-edge analysis techniques and pose significant challenges. A
   primary challenge is the extremely low-level representation of deployed
   contracts. We present Elipmoc, a decompiler for the next generation of
   smart contract analyses. Elipmoc is an evolution of Gigahorse, the top
   research decompiler, dramatically improving over it and over other
   state-of-the-art tools, by employing several high-precision techniques
   and making them scalable. Among these techniques are a new kind of
   context sensitivity (termed ``transactional sensitivity{''}) that
   provides a more effective static abstraction of distinct dynamic
   executions; a path-sensitive (yet scalable, through path merging)
   algorithm for inference of function arguments and returns; and a fully
   context sensitive private function reconstruction process. As a result,
   smart contract security analyses and reverse-engineering tools built on
   top of Elipmoc achieve high scalability, precision and completeness.
   Elipmoc improves over all notable past decompilers, including its
   predecessor, Gigahorse, and the stateof-the-art industrial tool,
   Panoramix, integrated into the primary Ethereum blockchain explorer,
   Etherscan. Elipmoc produces decompiled contracts with fully resolved
   operands at a rate of 99.5\% (compared to 62.8\% for Gigahorse), and
   achieves much higher completeness in code decornpilation than
   Panoramix-e.g., up to 67\% more coverage of external call
   statements-while being over 5x faster. Elipmoc has been the enabler for
   recent (independent) discoveries of several exploitable vulnerabilities
   on popular protocols, over funds in the many millions of dollars.},

Title = {Neutron: an attention-based neural decompiler},
Journal = {CYBERSECURITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {4},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Decompilation aims to analyze and transform low-level program language
   (PL) codes such as binary code or assembly code to obtain an equivalent
   high-level PL. Decompilation plays a vital role in the cyberspace
   security fields such as software vulnerability discovery and analysis,
   malicious code detection and analysis, and software engineering fields
   such as source code analysis, optimization, and cross-language
   cross-operating system migration. Unfortunately, the existing
   decompilers mainly rely on experts to write rules, which leads to
   bottlenecks such as low scalability, development difficulties, and long
   cycles. The generated high-level PL codes often violate the code writing
   specifications. Further, their readability is still relatively low. The
   problems mentioned above hinder the efficiency of advanced applications
   (e.g., vulnerability discovery) based on decompiled high-level PL
   codes.In this paper, we propose a decompilation approach based on the
   attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) mechanism, which
   converts low-level PL into high-level PL while acquiring legibility and
   keeping functionally similar. To compensate for the information
   asymmetry between the low-level and high-level PL, a translation method
   based on basic operations of low-level PL is designed. This method
   improves the generalization of the NMT model and captures the
   translation rules between PLs more accurately and efficiently. Besides,
   we implement a neural decompilation framework called Neutron. The
   evaluation of two practical applications shows that Neutron's average
   program accuracy is 96.96\%, which is better than the traditional NMT
   model.},

Title = {Java decompiler diversity and its application to meta-decompilation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {168},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {During compilation from Java source code to bytecode, some information
   is irreversibly lost. In other words, compilation and decompilation of
   Java code is not symmetric. Consequently, decompilation, which aims at
   producing source code from bytecode, relies on strategies to reconstruct
   the information that has been lost. Different Java decompilers use
   distinct strategies to achieve proper decompilation. In this work, we
   hypothesize that the diverse ways in which bytecode can be decompiled
   has a direct impact on the quality of the source code produced by
   decompilers.
   In this paper, we assess the strategies of eight Java decompilers with
   respect to three quality indicators: syntactic correctness, syntactic
   distortion and semantic equivalence modulo inputs. Our results show that
   no single modern decompiler is able to correctly handle the variety of
   bytecode structures coming from real-world programs. The highest ranking
   decompiler in this study produces syntactically correct, and
   semantically equivalent code output for 84\%, respectively 78\%, of the
   classes in our dataset. Our results demonstrate that each decompiler
   correctly handles a different set of bytecode classes.
   We propose a new decompiler called Arlecchino that leverages the
   diversity of existing decompilers. To do so, we merge partial
   decompilation into a new one based on compilation errors. Arlecchino
   handles 37.6\% of bytecode classes that were previously handled by no
   decompiler. We publish the sources of this new bytecode decompiler. (C)

Abstract = {Due to the increasing growth in the variety of Android malware, it is
   important to distinguish between the unique types of each. In this
   paper, we introduce the use of a decompiled source code for malicious
   code classification. This decompiled source code provides deeper
   analysis opportunities and understanding of the nature of malware.
   Malicious code differs from text due to syntax rules of compilers and
   the effort of attackers to evade potential detection. Hence, we adapt
   Natural Language Processing-based techniques under some constraints for
   malicious code classification. First, the proposed methodology
   decompiles the Android Package Kit files, then API calls, keywords, and
   non-obfuscated tokens are extracted from the source code and categorized
   to stop-tokens, feature-tokens, and long-tail-tokens. We also introduce
   the use of generalized N-tokens to represent tokens that are typically
   less frequent. Our approach was evaluated, in comparison to the use of
   API calls and permissions for features, as a baseline, and their
   combination, as well as in comparison to the use of neural network
   architectures based on decompiled Android Package Kits. A rigorous
   evaluation of comprehensive public real-world Android malware datasets,
   including 24,553 apps that were categorized to 71 families for the
   malicious families classification, and 60,000 apps for malicious code
   detection was performed. Our approach outperformed the baselines in both
   tasks. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In industrial control systems (ICS), attackers inject malicious
   control-logic into programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to sabotage
   physical processes, such as nuclear plants, traffic-light signals,
   elevators, and conveyor belts. For instance, Stuxnet operates by
   transfering control logic to Siemens S7-300 PLCs over the network to
   manipulate the motor speed of centrifuges. These devestating attacks are
   referred to as control-logic injection attacks. Their network traffic,
   if captured, contains malicious control logic that can be leveraged as a
   forensic artifact. In this paper, we present Reditus to recover control
   logic from a suspicious ICS network traffic. Reditus is based on the
   observation that an engineering software has a built-in decompiler that
   can transform the control logic into its source-code. Reditus integrates
   the decompiler with a (previously-captured) set of network traffic from
   a control-logic to recover the source code of the binary control-logic
   automatically. We evaluate Reditus on the network traffic of 40 control
   logic programs transferred from the SoMachine Basic engineering software
   to a Modicon M221 PLC. Our evaluation successfully demonstrates that
   Reditus can recover the source-code of a control logic from its network
   traffic. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

Title = {MalSFF: Multi-architecture malware detection using multi-static feature

Abstract = {Malware detection is a necessity in the modern digital world. This
   research presents a novel MalSFF: Multi-Architecture Malware Detection
   Using Multi-Static Feature Fusion Based on visual image analysis and
   transfer learning. Firstly, it decompiles binary programs to extract
   bytecodes and assembly code (ASM) through reverse-engineering before
   transforming them into grayscale images. This research strategically
   fine-tunes the MobileNet models (V1, V2, V3-Small, and V3-Large) for
   feature extraction of both file types. Thereafter, it performs feature
   stacking through early fusion, late fusion, and ensemble voting to
   obtain a single feature map, and then utilizes a filter-based feature
   selection algorithm. Finally, the MalSFF employs six different
   classifiers, with optimized hyperparameters using an automated
   grid-search algorithm. For better generalization, this study uses four
   different datasets: (i) Microsoft BIG, (ii) MalImg, (iii) Dumpware10,
   and (iv) Real-world samples. The MalSFF achieved 98.72\% accuracy for
   the MalImg and 96.93\% accuracy, 97\% precision, 97\% recall, and 97\%
   F1-score, 0.012 ms of response time for the BIG dataset. For
   memory-resident malware, it achieved 93.84\% accuracy and a 91\%
   F1-score, with a response time of only 0.05 s. The MalSFF demonstrates
   resilience against FGSM, PGD, and DeepFool adversarial attacks. The
   MalSFF is a lightweight and computationally efficient, well-suited for
   resource-constrained IIoT networks.},

Title = {Highliner: Enhancing Binary Analysis through NLP-Based Instruction-Level
   Detection of C plus plus Inline Functions},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON PRIVACY AND SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The complexities introduced by compiler optimization have long stood as
   a significant obstacle in binary analysis and reverse engineering.
   Function inlining, in particular, complicates function recognition by
   replacing function calls with the entire body of the callee, mixing code
   from multiple functions. State-of-the-art approaches can identify
   inlined functions at basic block granularity, but cannot determine which
   instructions belong to each function and precisely deduce inlined
   boundaries. Without this information, further analyses such as
   decompilation cannot be performed effectively. This article presents
   Highliner, a novel approach that improves state-of-the-art approaches by
   identifying inline instances at instruction-level granularity. Highliner
   operates downstream of block-level detectors: given basic blocks
   reported by state-of-the-art approaches as belonging to a specific
   inlined function, it labels each instruction as Inlined or Not inlined
   and recovers the inlined-function boundaries. We treat the problem as a
   sequence tagging task typical of NLP and implement a learning-based
   technique involving instruction embedding and recurrent neural networks.
   We compile a dataset of open-source projects with different
   optimizations and use the DWARF debug information standard to construct
   labeled sequences of inline instructions. We use this dataset to train,
   validate, and test a sequence labeling architecture in which
   instructions are encoded via the pre-trained assembly language
   transformer PalmTree and then processed by an RNN-based classifier to
   produce binary predictions. When evaluated as a binary classifier,
   Highliner achieves an F1-score of 0.94 overall. In addition, when
   specifically tested on recognizing function boundaries, Highliner
   achieves an Accuracy of 0.82 on initial boundaries and 0.83 on final
   boundaries.},

Abstract = {The cybersecurity threats targeting industrial control systems (ICSs)
   are evolving with increasing sophistication. Addressing the detection
   blind spots in existing source code analysis techniques, this study
   reveals a dual security paradox arising from code sensitivity: privacy
   leakage risks caused by decompilation techniques and integrity
   verification deficiencies in reverse engineering. This article
   investigates three critical challenges: 1) what are the component flow
   process and detection elements of ICS component source code? 2) how can
   high-performance and reliable tracing and traceability be provided for
   ICS component source code exceptions and routine detection? and 3) how
   can privacy enhancement and trusted detection of ICS component source
   code with high sensitivity be achieved? This article proposes a
   blockchain-integrated trusted detection framework for ICS (BCTD-ICS),
   delivering groundbreaking solutions: 1) establishing a lifecycle
   circulation model that systematically maps component types,
   stakeholders, and detection parameters; 2) developing a tripartite
   collaborative architecture {[}blockchain- identification resolution
   zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)], featuring a traceability mechanism with
   trusted identification codes (resolution efficiency: 40 ms/105 queries)
   to eliminate decompilation-induced privacy risks; and 3) creating an
   industrial-oriented privacy enhancement system utilizing DBSCAN
   clustering for intelligent sampling (26\% compression rate on BCN3D
   Moveo) and optimizing ZK-SNARK protocols through Shamir's secret
   sharing, establishing a backdoor-resistant distributed parameter
   generation system (time delay increment < 100 ms). Experimentally
   verified, our solution enables ICS component code detection
   supply-chain-wise without sensitive data leakage in real-world
   industries. This work establishes a novel trusted detection paradigm for
   ICS, advancing detection efficiency and credibility under strict privacy
   preservation requirements, meeting Industry 4.0 security demands.},

Title = {AndroMD: An Android malware detection framework based on source code
   analysis and permission scanning},
Journal = {RESULTS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {28},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The rapid growth of Android-based mobile and IoT applications has
   significantly increased the attack surface for malicious actors. These
   adversaries often exploit apps and social engineering to deliver malware
   that compromises device security and user privacy. To address this
   ongoing threat, we present AndroMD, an intelligent and scalable Android
   malware detection framework that combines automated dataset
   construction, optimal feature selection, and ensemble-based
   classification. The proposed framework is built on three core
   components. First, an automated pipeline processes over 600,000 APKs to
   extract static features from more than 140 million Java files and
   600,000 manifest files, resulting in three distinct datasets: KeyCount,
   ZeroOne, and MNF. These datasets are constructed using keys and patterns
   derived from a detailed analysis of real decompiled malware code,
   ensuring semantic relevance. Second, we introduce the AndroMD Optimal
   Feature Selection (AOFS) method, which selects compact, high-performing
   feature subsets using iterative evaluation based on ensemble feedback.
   Third, an ensemble detection model combines Random Forest, Decision
   Tree, and Bagging classifiers, with a threshold-based aggregation
   mechanism that allows fine-grained control over detection sensitivity.
   Extensive evaluation demonstrates AndroMD's strong performance,
   achieving up to 99.88\% accuracy on internal datasets and 91.66\%
   accuracy in live testing, including detection of custom and zero-day
   malware samples. AndroMD also identifies threats overlooked by
   VirusTotal, showcasing its real-world applicability. The framework,
   along with sample datasets and code, is made publicly available to
   support reproducibility and further research on Android security.},

Title = {Feature fusion-based squeeze and excitation (FFSE)-bidirectional
   temporal convolutional network (BiTCN): A hybrid malware detection model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SECURITY},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {34},
Number = {1},
Pages = {29-45},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cybersecurity threats continue to escalate with the rapid advancement of
   internet technology, with malicious code posing a particularly daunting
   challenge. Traditional detection methods based on feature code matching
   struggle to keep pace with evolving anti-detection techniques and the
   proliferation of malicious code variants. Current malware detection
   often relies on extracting opcode sequences or converting binary files
   into grayscale maps for analysis based on deep learning. However,
   text-based methods for malware detection face decompilation errors due
   to obfuscation, which compromise feature extraction accuracy, and the
   limitation of n-gram in capturing global behavior patterns beyond local
   opcode sequences. Image-based methods, on the other hand, risk losing
   code structure and semantics during image conversion, and the need for
   fixed-size inputs in convolutional neural networks can lead to feature
   information loss during resizing or cropping. To address these
   challenges, this paper proposes feature fusion-based squeeze and
   excitation (FFSE)-bidirectional temporal convolutional network (BiTCN),
   a novel hybrid malware detection model that integrates the advantages of
   FFSE and BiTCN. The FFSE is utilized to extract multi-scale features and
   fuse global and local features with a channel attention mechanism, while
   the BiTCN is adopted to capture temporal evolution of malware behavior
   and integrate features of different levels with a pooling fusion
   mechanism. Experimental results on the BIG2015 and DataCon datasets
   demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing malware
   detection methods in terms of Accuracy , Recall , and F1-score . It
   proves the robustness and generalization of the proposed model and
   contributes significantly to the field of malware detection.},

Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2025},

Abstract = {Natural hierarchical porous materials, inspired by biological systems
   like plant vascular networks, hold trans-formative potential for
   energy-efficient and environmental applications. However, translating
   these natural designs into engineered aerogels with precise multiscale
   pore control and multifunctional performance remains a critical
   challenge. To address this gap, we propose a dual-innovation strategy
   integrating bioinspired structural engineering and composite property
   synergy. First, we developed an aramid-fiber
   decompilation/reconstruction process using ultrasound-assisted
   hydrothermal cracking to produce platelet nanofibers. Second, a dynamic
   icetemplating technique was employed to create annular temperature
   gradients, enabling directional self-assembly of nanofibers into
   density-gradient pore architectures. This bioinspired based design not
   only replicates the structural complexity of natural systems and
   realizes the interfacial synergy of the components (embodied by a
   negative Poisson's ratio of-0.30 and an ultra-high porosity of 94.20
   \%), but also confers an excellent fatigue resistance to Si@ANF/CNF
   aerogel, which maintains a strain retention rate of 83.06 \% after 100
   cycles of 50 \% strain. The resulting composite system demonstrates
   exceptional multifunctionality, including excellent oil-water separation
   capability (49-102 g/g, 99.76 \% water repellency) and superior thermal
   insulation (0.044 W/m \& sdot;K at 160 degrees C). By demonstrating that
   bioinspired structural precision inherently enables multifunctional
   optimization, this work bridges the gap between natural design
   principles and scalable engineering solutions, offering a sustainable
   platform for advanced aerogel applications.},

Abstract = {Reverse engineering complex proprietary software is a tedious and time
   consuming task. A fair amount of the overall effort is usually devoted
   to locating those software components which are responsible for the
   functionality of interest (e.g., a proprietary encryption algorithm). To
   aid this process, several tools, available in the public domain, can be
   used, implementing sophisticated algorithms for control-flow recovery,
   stack frame recovery, data type inference, decompilation etc. However,
   the important problem of decomposing a binary executable to its
   constituent object files (or compile-units) has not been, in our
   opinion, sufficiently studied. In this paper we present novel techniques
   for estimating the number, as well as the boundaries, of compile-units
   in binary executables. We present algorithms which recover information
   that improves the precision degree in reverse engineering tasks. In
   addition, our algorithms can be used to reduce the effort of locating,
   recovering and understanding specific functionalities of closed-source
   software. We evaluate our algorithms on the public DeepBinDiff ELF
   dataset, consisting of \textbackslash{}documentclass{[}12pt]\{minimal\}

   of GNU GDB, built for ARM and AArch64 and show that they consistently
   approach the ground-truth, with an average recovery precision close to
   75\%. Furthermore, we show how our research can aid in binary diffing
   applications, by comparing the recovered compile-unit structure of a
   pair of Microsoft Windows kernel images. We make our prototype
   implementation, written in Python and named REcover, publicly available
   for further evaluation by the reverse engineering community.},

Volume = {35},

Abstract = {Legacy software, particularly from the 1990s, often becomes obsolete due
   to aging hardware and outdated software environments. Traditionally,
   software modernization required extensive manual effort, involving
   reverse engineering, code rewriting, and re-architecting. However,
   advancements in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new
   possibilities for automating software translation and modernization.
   This paper explores the feasibility of using LLMs for modernizing
   90s-era Windows applications, specifically migrating legacy C and C++
   code to Python. Our methodology includes decompilation, source code
   analysis, automated translation using ChatGPT, and user interface
   reconstruction. We empirically evaluate three software projects by
   analyzing LLM-based translation accuracy across different code
   structures, including algorithmic logic, file handling, and graphical
   interfaces. Results indicate that while LLMs achieve high translation
   accuracy (-88\%) for structured code, challenges persist in handling
   decompiled code and user interface generation. The study provides
   insights into the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in real-world
   software renovation, offering guidelines for leveraging machine learning
   in legacy system modernization. These findings contribute to both
   academic research and practical applications, suggesting a pathway for
   cost-effective and scalable legacy software migration.},

   industrial control systems},
Journal = {RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY},
Year = {2026},
Volume = {265},
Number = {A},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The architecture of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) has evolved into an
   integrated cyber-physical system, introducing covert, zero-dynamic
   cyberattack vectors that threaten the reliability of ICS. We address two
   issues: (1) how to use decentralized solutions to defend
   resource-constrained ICS against highly covert zero-dynamic attacks; (2)
   how to improve performance (meeting real-time, high-frequency
   interaction demands) while enhancing reliability via decentralization.
   We propose a defense model integrating blockchain, zero-knowledge
   proofs, and smart contract (SC) obfuscation to bolster ICS resilience. A
   customized zk-SNARK algorithm enables efficient identity authentication,
   completed in under 3 ms. The Garble framework obfuscates SCs, concealing
   ICS device IP addresses and disrupting attack chains. A blockchain acts
   as a secure intermediary between the engineer workstation (EW) and
   programmable logic controller (PLC). To reduce blockchain overhead, we
   refine a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based roulette wheel
   algorithm. Obfuscated SCs resist decompilation by tools such as Objdump,
   ensuring robust protection. Our node selection mechanism balances
   security and diversity, mitigating systemic biases like the Matthew
   effect. By leveraging blockchain to supply computational power for
   encrypting and protecting ICS data flows, we offer new insights into
   defending ICS against highly covert cyberattacks. Experimental
   evaluation validates the model's effectiveness under real-world ICS
   scenarios.},

Title = {Compiler Identification with Divisive Analysis and Support Vector
   Machine},
Journal = {SYMMETRY-BASEL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN 3},
Abstract = {Compilers play a crucial role in software development, as most software
   must be compiled into binaries before release. Analyzing the compiler
   version from binary files is of great importance in software reverse
   engineering, maintenance, traceability, and information security. In
   this work, we propose a novel framework for compiler version
   identification. Firstly, we generated 1000 C language source codes using
   CSmith and subsequently compiled them into 16,000 binary files using 16
   distinct versions of compilers. The symmetric distribution of the
   dataset among different compiler versions may ensure unbiased model
   training. Then, IDA Pro was used to decompile the binary files into
   assembly instruction sequences. From these sequences, we extracted
   frequency-based features via the Bag-of-Words (BOW) model and
   sequence-based features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix
   (GLCM). Finally, we introduced a divide-and-conquer framework
   (DIANA-SVM) to effectively classify compiler versions. The experimental
   results demonstrate that traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) models
   struggle to accurately identify compiler versions using compiled
   executable files. In contrast, DIANA-SVM's symmetric data separation
   approach enhances performance, achieving an accuracy of 94\% (+/-
   0.375\%). This framework enables precise identification of high-risk
   compiler versions, offering a reliable tool for software supply chain
   security. Theoretically, our GLCM-based sequence modeling and
   divide-and-conquer framework advance feature extraction methodologies
   for binary files, offering a scalable solution for similar
   classification tasks beyond compiler identification.},

Title = {A static method for detecting android malware based on directed API call},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {21},
Number = {3},
Pages = {183-204},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Purpose- The openness of the Android operating system offers users
   convenience but also exposes them to a multitude of malicious
   applications. Consequently, analyzing applications before installation
   has become a crucial research area in mobile security. Static analysis,
   known for its accuracy and low cost, is a prominent method within this
   field. This paper aims to propose an ML/DL-based approach to detect
   benign and malicious applications in APK format.
   Design/methodology/approach- The analysis method, detailed further in
   the paper, consists of five steps. Step 1, each APK file in the sample
   set undergoes decompilation to convert it into source code. Then,
   directed API call graph (DACG) generator is used to analyze the
   decompiled source code from Step 1 and extract API calls. After that,
   the authors apply the graph2vec method to convert the DACG data set into
   characteristic subgraphs. Next, saving the necessary features that each
   model needs to learn from the vector set. This helps reduce the vector
   dimensionality for each model type and reduces time and noise by
   eliminating unnecessary features. Finally, training and evaluating the
   ability to detect Android malware based on popular machine learning
   algorithms such as Random Forest, support vector machine, K-nearest
   neighbor, logistic regression and one of the most powerful machine
   learning algorithms currently available, gradient boosting regression.
   Findings- The authors come to the conclusion, feature graphs based on
   API call graphs are effective in detecting Android malware. Experimental
   results demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over existing
   detection methods on a data set of 7,000 samples, achieving TPR > 97\%,
   FPR < 1\% and AUC similar to 0.98. Following these steps, a final
   classification will determine the safety of the tested application,
   aiding users in avoiding malware installation. Research
   limitations/implications- Although some limitations remain to be
   addressed, the DACG construction method holds significant potential for
   further exploration. Future research will focus on integrating dynamic
   analysis techniques to broaden the detectable and classifiable Android
   malware categories. In addition, the authors aim to adapt the
   methodology for broader applicability to other system types, including
   the widely used ELF systems in Linux. Originality/value- In the study,
   the authors addressed the issue of generating graph-based feature for
   Android malware detection in a meaningful, practical and efficient way.
   The results can be used as a pattern for similar scenarios and
   applications.},

Title = {Low complexity decompression method for FPGA bitstreams},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {FPGA bitstream is a binary file containing chip configuration
   information. It is often compressed to conserve storage space and reduce
   configuration time. However, if the bitstream file is compressed,
   hardware attacks cannot be detected because FPGA reverse-engineering
   tools can only decompile uncompressed and unencrypted bitstream. This
   study proposes a low complexity decompression method for commercial FPGA
   bitstreams, which is a crucial step for assessing the security of FPGAs.
   By comparing the structure of compressed and uncompressed bitstream
   files, we identify the compression region, extract the compressed data,
   and construct a database for the mapping information. Then, we introduce
   a decoding algorithm that utilizes a sliding window approach based on
   the characteristics of the compressed data and implement the algorithm
   on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA. Finally, the proposed framework is validated
   on 24 different types of Intel FPGAs from 6 families, with a perfect
   accuracy rate of 100\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   paper to disclose a decompression method for commercial FPGAs.},

Title = {Detecting Malicious .NET Executables Using Extracted Methods Names},
Journal = {AI},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The .NET framework is widely used for software development, making it a
   target for a significant number of malware attacks by developing
   malicious executables. Previous studies on malware detection often
   relied on developing generic detection methods for Windows malware that
   were not tailored to the unique characteristics of .NET executables. As
   a result, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the
   development of effective detection methods tailored to .NET malware.
   This work introduces a novel framework for detecting malicious .NET
   executables using statically extracted method names. To address the lack
   of datasets focused exclusively on .NET malware, a new dataset
   consisting of both malicious and benign .NET executable features was
   created. Our approach involves decompiling .NET executables, parsing the
   resulting code, and extracting standard .NET method names. Subsequently,
   feature selection techniques were applied to filter out less relevant
   method names. The performance of six machine learning models-XGBoost,
   random forest, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM),
   logistic regression, and na \& iuml;ve Bayes-was compared. The results
   indicate that XGBoost outperforms the other models, achieving an
   accuracy of 96.16\% and an F1-score of 96.15\%. The experimental results
   show that standard .NET method names are reliable features for detecting
   .NET malware.},

Title = {Sensitive Target-Guided Directed Fuzzing for IoT Web Services},
Journal = {CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS \& CONTINUA},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {83},
Number = {3},
Pages = {4939-4959},
Abstract = {The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought convenience
   to people's lives, but it also introduces significant security risks.
   Due to the limitations of IoT devices themselves and the challenges of
   re-hosting technology, existing fuzzing for IoT devices is mainly
   conducted through black-box methods, which lack effective execution
   feedback and are blind. Meanwhile, the existing static methods mainly
   rely on taint analysis, which has high overhead and high false alarm
   rates. We propose a new directed fuzz testing method for detecting bugs
   in web service programs of IoT devices, which can test IoT devices more
   quickly and efficiently. Specifically, we identify external input entry
   points using multiple features. Then we quickly find sensitive targets
   and paths affected by external input sources based on sensitive data
   flow analysis of decompiled code, treating them as testing objects.
   Finally, we perform a directed fuzzing test. We use debugging interfaces
   to collect execution feedback and guide the program to reach sensitive
   targets based on program pruning techniques. We have implemented a
   prototype system, AntDFuzz, and evaluated it on firmware from ten
   devices across five well-known manufacturers. We discovered twelve
   potential vulnerabilities, seven of which were confirmed and assigned
   bug id by China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD). The results show
   that our approach has the ability to find unknown bugs in real devices
   and is more efficient compared to existing tools.},

Title = {A Deep Learning-Based Ensemble Framework for Robust Android Malware
   Detection},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {46673-46696},
Abstract = {The exponential growth of Android applications has resulted in a surge
   of malware threats, posing severe risks to user privacy and data
   security. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel
   malware detection approach utilizing an ensemble of Convolutional Neural
   Networks (CNNs) for enhanced classification accuracy. The methodology
   incorporates a multi-phase process, starting with the extraction and
   preprocessing of APK (Android app) files. The preprocessing phase
   involves decompressing, decompiling, and transforming the APK files into
   bytecode and Dex files. The extracted byte data is converted into 1D
   vectors and reshaped into 2D grayscale images, enabling efficient
   feature learning through CNNs. The proposed ensemble of CNN-based models
   undergoes comprehensive training, validation, and evaluation,
   demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches. We
   used two popular Android datasets to evaluate the performance of our
   proposed model. Specifically, the model achieves an accuracy of 98.65\%,
   F1-score of 96.43\% on the Drebin dataset and attains 97.91\% accuracy,
   96.73\% of F1-score on the AMD dataset. These results confirm the mode's
   ability to effectively identify Android malware with high precision and
   reliability, outperforming traditional techniques. This research not
   only underscores the potential of our proposed approach in malware
   detection but also sets a foundation for future advancements. Future
   efforts will focus on real-time malware detection, integration with
   mobile security frameworks, and evaluation across diverse datasets to
   ensure adaptability to emerging malware threats.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {208483-208497},
Abstract = {The Android operating system continues to face escalating security
   challenges, primarily due to its open-source nature and the rapid
   proliferation of applications from untrusted sources. Traditional static
   analysis tools lack the flexibility to capture evolving malware
   behaviors, limiting their interpretability and scalability. Large
   Language Models (LLMs) are now applied in cybersecurity for malware
   detection, phishing classification, and cyber threat intelligence.
   However, their use has not been extended to producing detailed and
   interpretable Android malware analysis reports. This study integrates
   LLMs into Android malware analysis by creating a dataset for instruction
   tuning and fine-tuning the Qwen-7B model using the LoRA method. The
   model MalQwen is developed by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5-7B with 429 malware
   samples containing decompiled code and expert labeled security reports.
   MalQwen outperforms models like Gemini and LLaMA, achieving a BERTscore
   of 0.84 for SMS malware and a Perplexity score of 3.30 for Scareware.
   These findings confirm MalQwen's superior performance in generating
   precise malware reports, validating LLMs as a powerful new method for
   Android malware analysis.},

Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {9},
Number = {POPL},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT) provides a sound and complete
   framework to reason about trace equivalence between simple imperative
   programs. However, there are still several notable limitations. First,
   GKAT is completely agnostic with respect to the meaning of primitives,
   to keep equivalence decidable. Second, GKAT excludes non-local control
   flow such as goto, break, and return. To overcome these limitations, we
   introduce Control-Flow GKAT (CF-GKAT), a system that allows reasoning
   about programs that include non-local control flow as well as hardcoded
   values. CF-GKAT is able to soundly and completely verify trace
   equivalence of a larger class of programs, while preserving the
   nearly-linear efficiency of GKAT. This makes CF-GKAT suitable for the
   verification of control-flow manipulating procedures, such as
   decompilation and goto-elimination. To demonstrate CF-GKAT's abilities,
   we validated the output of several highly non-trivial program
   transformations, such as Erosa and Hendren's goto-elimination procedure
   and the output of Ghidra decompiler. CF-GKAT opens up the application of
   Kleene Algebra to a wider set of challenges, and provides an important
   verification tool that can be applied to the field of decompilation and
   control-flow transformation.},

Title = {CrossCode2Vec: A unified representation across source and binary
   functions for code similarity detection},
Journal = {NEUROCOMPUTING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {620},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Code similarity detection identifies code by analyzing similarities in
   syntax, semantics, and structure, which includes types of tasks:
   source-to-source, binary-to-binary, and source-to-binary. Due to
   encoding and representation disparities between source and binary code,
   existing methods have mainly focused on individual tasks, without
   providing a universal solution. Additionally, current source-to-binary
   tasks only achieve one-to-one matching between source code and binary
   functions, neglecting the one-to-many relationship inherent between
   source code and its cross-compiled binaries. In this paper, we propose
   CrossCode2Vec, a unified framework for representing code in both source
   and binary functions, which aims to bridge the gap in original coding
   features and provide a standardized similarity measurement across three
   code similarity detection tasks. For source code and its corresponding
   compiled binary, we first design an enhanced Abstract Path Context data
   preprocessing method, construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) from both
   source code functions and decompiled binary functions, and implement the
   function embedding followed by the pre-trained Word2vec model. Then we
   propose a task-specific data sampling strategy. We establish a
   one-to-one correspondence between source and binary functions through
   symbol tables and create a one-to-many relationship between source
   functions and their cross-compiled binaries based on sampling rules.
   Finally, we employ a hierarchical LSTM-attention network to facilitate
   the representation and similarity measurement of functions. We conduct
   both extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations to confirm the effectiveness of
   CrossCode2Vec in code representation and code similarity tasks,
   validating its superiority in model architecture and data processing
   methods. CrossCode2Vec demonstrates stable and exceptional performance
   across multiple experiments, reinforcing its ability to bridge the gap
   between source and binary code representations while effectively
   measuring their similarities.},

Abstract = {One of the tasks of security analysts is to detect security
   vulnerabilities and ongoing attacks. There is already a large number of
   software tools that can help to collect security-relevant data, such as
   event logs, security settings, application manifests, and even the
   (decompiled) source code of potentially malicious applications. The
   analyst must study these data, evaluate them, and properly identify and
   classify suspicious activities and applications. Fast advances in the
   area of Artificial Intelligence have produced large language models that
   can perform a variety of tasks, including generating text summaries and
   reports. In this article, we study the potential black-box use of LLM
   chatbots as a support tool for security analysts. We provide two case
   studies: the first is concerned with the identification of
   vulnerabilities in Android applications, and the second one is concerned
   with the analysis of security logs. We show how LLM chatbots can help
   security analysts in their work, but point out specific limitations and
   security concerns related to this approach.},

Title = {A fine-grained approach for Android taint analysis based on labeled
   taint value graphs},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {148},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Static taint analysis is a widely used method to identify
   vulnerabilities in Android applications. However, the existing tools for
   static analysis often struggle with processing times, particularly when
   dealing with complex real-world programs. To reduce time consumption,
   some tools choose to sacrifice analytical precision, e.g., FastDroid
   sets an upper limit for analysis iterations in Android applications. In
   this paper, we propose a labeled taint value graph (LTVG) to store taint
   flows, and implement a fine-grained analysis tool called LabeledDroid.
   This graph is constructed based on the taint value graph (TVG) of
   FastDroid, and takes into account both precision and time consumption.
   That is, we decompile an Android app into Jimple statements, develop
   finegrained propagation rules to handle List, and construct LTVGs
   according to these rules. Afterwards, we traverse LTVGs to obtain
   high-precision taint flows. An analysis of 39 apps from the TaintBench
   benchmark shows that LabeledDroid is 0.87 s faster than FastDroid on
   average. Furthermore, if some common accuracy parameters are adapted in
   both LabeledDroid and FastDroid, the experiment demonstrates that the
   former is more scalable. Moreover, the maximum analysis time of
   LabeledDroid is less than 200 s and its average time is 46.25 s, while
   FastDroid sometimes experiences timeouts with durations longer than 600
   s. Additionally, LabeledDroid achieves a precision of 70\% in handling
   lists, while FastDroid and TaintSA achieve precisions of 38.9\% and
   41.2\%, respectively.},

Title = {REMaQE: Reverse Engineering Math Equations from Executables},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Cybersecurity attacks on embedded devices for industrial control systems
   and cyber-physical systems may cause catastrophic physical damage as
   well as economic loss. This could be achieved by infecting device
   binaries with malware that modifies the physical characteristics of the
   system operation. Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse
   engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of
   mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional
   reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but
   offer little semantic insight. This article proposes the REMaQE
   automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from
   binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles
   equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or
   pointers, and can reverse engineer equations from object-oriented
   implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug
   in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool ``tmon.{''} To evaluate
   REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations
   implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a
   semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes
   in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations.
   Real-time execution enables integration in an interactive math-oriented
   reverse engineering workflow.},

Title = {VARLIFTER: Recovering Variables and Types from Bytecode of Solidity
   Smart Contracts},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Number = {OOPSLA},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Since funds or tokens in smart contracts are maintained through specific
   state variables, contract audit, an effective means for security
   assurance, particularly focuses on these variables and their related
   operations. However, the absence of publicly accessible source code for
   numerous contracts, with only bytecode exposed, hinders audit efforts.
   Recovering variables and their types from Solidity bytecode is thus a
   critical task in smart contract analysis and audit, yet this is a
   challenging task because the bytecode loses variable and type
   information, only with low-level data operated by stack manipulations
   and untyped memory/storage accesses. The state-of-the-art smart contract
   decompilers miss identifying many variables and incorrectly infer the
   types for many identified variables. To this end, we propose VARLIFTER,
   a lifter dedicated to the precise and efficient recovery of typed
   variables. VARLIFTER interprets every read or written field of a data
   region as at least one potential variable, and after discarding falsely
   identified variables, it progressively refines the variable types based
   on the variable behaviors in the form of operation sequences. We
   evaluate VARLIFTER on 34,832 real-world Solidity smart contracts.
   VARLIFTER attains a precision of 97.48\% and a recall of 91.84\% for
   typed variable recovery. Moreover, VARLIFTER finishes analyzing 77\% of
   smart contracts in around 10 seconds per contract. If VARLIFTER is used
   to replace the variable recovery modules of the two state-of-the-art
   Solidity bytecode decompilers, 52.4\%, and 74.6\% more typed variables
   will be correctly recovered, respectively. The applications of VARLIFTER
   to contract decompilation, contract audit, and contract bytecode fuzzing
   illustrate that the recovered variable information improves many
   contract analysis tasks.},

Title = {GMADV: An android malware variant generation and classification
   adversarial training framework},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {84},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Android malware uses anti-reverse analysis and APK shelling technology,
   which leads to the failure of the classification method based on
   decompiled features and the reduction of the classification accuracy
   based on single file features. Moreover, the lack of samples in some
   families of Android malware makes the classification model based on
   sample learning ineffective. To solve the above problems, this paper
   proposes a two-layer general framework for Android malware
   classification and adversarial training named GMADV, which enhances
   classifier performance through adversarial training. In the sample
   classification layer, based on the transformation method of the Markov
   model, it is proposed for the first time to convert the three files in
   the APK into RGB Markov images, and use VGG13 to automatically extract
   features and classification; In the variant amplification layer, the
   idea of ``regression for generation{''} is firstly proposed, and GMM-GAN
   based on Gaussian process is designed to amplify the diversity of
   samples within the family. The experimental results show that RGB Markov
   images have better classification performance than grayscale images. On
   the three datasets, the classification effect after amplification has
   been improved to varying degrees, and all F1\_Score reaches 95 \%.
   Compared with other methods, GMADV has stronger family sample
   amplification ability and greater adversarial intensity.},

Title = {How to Circumvent and Beat the Ransomware in Android Operating System-A
   Case Study of Locker.CB!tr},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Ransomware is one of the most extended cyberattacks. It consists of
   encrypting a user's files or locking the smartphone in order to
   blackmail a victim. The attacking software is ordered on the infected
   device from the attacker's remote server, known as command and control.
   In this work, we propose a method to recover from a Locker.CB!tr
   ransomware attack after it has infected and hit a smartphone. The
   novelty of our approach lies on exploiting the communication between the
   ransomware on the infected device and the attacker's command and control
   server as a point to reverse disruptive actions like screen locking or
   file encryption. For this purpose, we carried out both a dynamic and a
   static analysis of decompiled Locker.CB!tr ransomware source code to
   understand its operation principles and exploited communication patterns
   from the IP layer to the application layer to fully impersonate the
   command and control server. This way, we gained full control over the
   Locker.CB!tr ransomware instance. From that moment, we were able to
   command the Locker.CB!tr ransomware instance on the infected device to
   unlock the smartphone or decrypt the files. The contributions of this
   work are a novel method to recover the mobile phone after ransomware
   attack based on the analysis of the ransomware communication with the
   C\&C server; and a mechanism for impersonating the ransomware C\&C
   server and thus gaining full control over the ransomware instance.},

Title = {A comprehensive survey of smart contract security: State of the art and
   research directions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {226},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Future protocols in the digital society will be built on the foundation
   of smart contracts, which are code and algorithmic contracts. Smart
   contracts enable all phases of the contracting process without the need
   for outside parties by using protocols and user interfaces. But as
   blockchain technology has quickly advanced, many security flaws in smart
   contracts have also come to light. This article offers a thorough
   examination and organized summary of the pertinent material of smart
   contract security analysis. These sections make up the bulk of our
   survey's contributions. First, a brief history of Ethereum is provided,
   followed by a proposal of the security difficulties now faced by
   blockchain smart contracts, with a focus on the analysis and
   classification of various security flaws. Second, based on a thorough
   examination of these studies, we present a summary of various smart
   contract security options, including case studies and detailed
   descriptions of the state-of-the-art in terms of automatic auditing,
   subject matter experts, scalable smart contracts, smart contract
   templates, decompilers, semantic frameworks, and anomaly detection.
   Finally, we go over each sort of solution's advantages and disadvantages
   and outline potential future research trajectories.},

Title = {Mitigating Debugger-based Attacks to Java Applications with
   Self-debugging},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Number = {4},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Java bytecode is a quite high-level language and, as such, it is fairly
   easy to analyze and decompile with malicious intents, e.g., to tamper
   with code and skip license checks. Code obfuscation was a first attempt
   to mitigate malicious reverse-engineering based on static analysis.
   However, obfuscated code can still be dynamically analyzed with standard
   debuggers to perform step-wise execution and to inspect (or change)
   memory content at important execution points, e.g., to alter the verdict
   of license validity checks. Although some approaches have been proposed
   to mitigate debugger-based attacks, they are only applicable to binary
   compiled code and none address the challenge of protecting Java
   bytecode.
   In this article, we propose a novel approach to protect Java bytecode
   from malicious debugging. Our approach is based on automated program
   transformation to manipulate Java bytecode and split it into two binary
   processes that debug each other (i.e., a self-debugging solution). In
   fact, when the debugging interface is already engaged, an additional
   malicious debugger cannot attach. To be resilient against typical
   attacks, our approach adopts a series of technical solutions, e.g., an
   encoded channel is shared by the two processes to avoid leaking
   information, an authentication protocol is established to avoid
   Man-in-the-middle attacks, and the computation is spread between the two
   processes to prevent the attacker to replace or terminate either of
   them.
   We test our solution on 18 real-world Java applications, showing that
   our approach can effectively block the most common debugging tasks
   (either with the Java debugger or the GNU debugger) while preserving the
   functional correctness of the protected programs. While the final
   decision on when to activate this protection is still up to the
   developers, the observed performance overhead was acceptable for common
   desktop application domains.},

Abstract = {Food chemicals have a fundamental role in our lives, with an extended
   impact on nutrition, disease prevention, and marked economic
   implications in the food industry. The number of food chemical compounds
   in public databases has substantially increased in the past few years,
   which can be characterized using chemoinformatics approaches. We and
   other groups explored public food chemical libraries containing up to
   26,500 compounds. This study aimed to analyze the chemical contents,
   diversity, and coverage in the chemical space of food chemicals and
   additives and, from here on, food components. The approach to food
   components addressed in this study is a public database with more than
   70,000 compounds, including those predicted via omics techniques. It was
   concluded that food components have distinctive physicochemical
   properties and constitutional descriptors despite sharing many chemical
   structures with natural products. Food components, on average, have
   large molecular weights and several apolar structures with saturated
   hydrocarbons. Compared to reference databases, food component structures
   have low scaffold and fingerprint-based diversity and high structural
   complexity, as measured by the fraction of sp3 carbons. These structural
   features are associated with a large fraction of macronutrients as
   lipids. Lipids in food components were decompiled by an analysis of the
   maximum common substructures. The chemical multiverse representation of
   food chemicals showed a larger coverage of chemical space than natural
   products and FDA-approved drugs by using different sets of
   representations.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of Android-based devices has brought about an
   unprecedented surge in mobile application usage, making the Android
   ecosystem a prime target for cybercriminals. In this paper, a new method
   for Android malware classification is proposed. The method implements a
   convolutional neural network for malware classification using images.
   The research presents a novel approach to transforming the Android
   Application Package (APK) into a grayscale image. The image creation
   utilizes natural language processing techniques for text cleaning,
   extraction, and fuzzy hashing to represent the decompiled code from the
   APK in a set of hashes after preprocessing, where the image is composed
   of n fuzzy hashes that represent an APK. The method was tested on an
   Android malware dataset with 15,493 samples of five malware types. The
   proposed method showed an increase in accuracy compared to others in the
   literature, achieving up to 98.24\% in the classification task.},

Abstract = {Familiar analysis for malware plays an important role in comprehending
   the diversity of malicious behaviors and identifying the emerging
   security threats. Existing studies mainly focus on classifying malware
   into known families by supervised learning. However, these methods face
   two main challenges, 1) the lack of a large amount of labeled data and
   2) the poor effectiveness in identifying unknown families of malware. To
   overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called multiple
   features (MulFC) based on unsupervised learning. In the method, we first
   leverage a decompiling tool to extract multiple features, including
   manifest features, application programming interface (API) features, and
   opcode features. Then, the opcode features are preprocessed to filter
   out the redundant ones to reduce the calculation cost. After that, we
   adopt the Jaccard index to calculate the similarities between malware
   and construct a malware network. Finally, InfoMap is applied to perform
   the clustering on the basis of the malware network. Overall, MulFC does
   not require the use of labeled data and can identify unknown families of
   malware. Experiments are conducted on two datasets for the performance
   evaluation of MulFC. The experimental results show that MulFC achieves
   0.810 in terms of normalized mutual information, 0.576 in terms of
   adjusted rand index, 0.620 in terms of the Fowlkes-Mallows index, and
   0.805 in terms of V-measure on average, and outperforms the
   state-of-the-art baseline method by 0.060, 0.054, 0.038, and 0.065,

Abstract = {With the rising prominence of smart contracts, security attacks
   targeting them have increased, posing severe threats to their security
   and intellectual property rights. Existing simplistic datasets hinder
   effective vulnerability detection, raising security concerns. To address
   these challenges, we propose BiAn, a source code level smart contract
   obfuscation method that generates complex vulnerability test datasets.
   BiAn protects contracts by obfuscating data flows, control flows, and
   code layouts, increasing complexity and making it harder for attackers
   to discover vulnerabilities. Our experiments with buggy contracts showed
   an average complexity enhancement of approximately 174\% after
   obfuscation. Decompilers Vandal and Gigahorse had total failure rate
   increments of 38.8\% and 40.5\% respectively. Obfuscated contracts also
   decreased vulnerability detection rates in more than 50\% of cases for
   ten widely-used static analysis detection tools.},

Abstract = {From logical reasoning to mental simulation, biological and artificial
   neural systems possess an incredible capacity for computation. Such
   neural computers offer a fundamentally novel computing paradigm by
   representing data continuously and processing information in a natively
   parallel and distributed manner. To harness this computation, prior work
   has developed extensive training techniques to understand existing
   neural networks. However, the lack of a concrete and low-level machine
   code for neural networks precludes us from taking full advantage of a
   neural computing framework. Here we provide such a machine code along
   with a programming framework by using a recurrent neural network-a
   reservoir computer-to decompile, code and compile analogue computations.
   By decompiling the reservoir's internal representation and dynamics into
   an analytic basis of its inputs, we define a low-level neural machine
   code that we use to program the reservoir to solve complex equations and
   store chaotic dynamical systems as random-access memory. We further
   provide a fully distributed neural implementation of software
   virtualization and logical circuits, and even program a playable game of
   pong inside of a reservoir computer. Importantly, all of these functions
   are programmed without requiring any example data or sampling of state
   space. Finally, we demonstrate that we can accurately decompile the
   analytic, internal representations of a full-rank reservoir computer
   that has been conventionally trained using data. Taken together, we
   define an implementation of neural computation that can both decompile
   computations from existing neural connectivity and compile distributed
   programs as new connections.},

Title = {An Android Malware Detection Approach to Enhance Node Feature
   Differences in a Function Call Graph Based on GCNs},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},

Abstract = {The smartphone has become an indispensable tool in our daily lives, and
   the Android operating system is widely installed on our smartphones.
   This makes Android smartphones a prime target for malware. In order to
   address threats posed by malware, many researchers have proposed
   different malware detection approaches, including using a function call
   graph (FCG). Although an FCG can capture the complete call-callee
   semantic relationship of a function, it will be represented as a huge
   graph structure. The presence of many nonsensical nodes affects the
   detection efficiency. At the same time, the characteristics of the graph
   neural networks (GNNs) make the important node features in the FCG tend
   toward similar nonsensical node features during the propagation process.
   In our work, we propose an Android malware detection approach to enhance
   node feature differences in an FCG. Firstly, we propose an API-based
   node feature by which we can visually analyze the behavioral properties
   of different functions in the app and determine whether their behavior
   is benign or malicious. Then, we extract the FCG and the features of
   each function from the decompiled APK file. Next, we calculate the API
   coefficient inspired by the idea of the TF-IDF algorithm and extract the
   sensitive function called subgraph (S-FCSG) based on API coefficient
   ranking. Finally, before feeding the S-FCSG and node features into the
   GCN model, we add the self-loop for each node of the S-FCSG. A 1-D
   convolutional neural network and fully connected layers are used for
   further feature extraction and classification, respectively. The
   experimental result shows that our approach enhances the node feature
   differences in an FCG, and the detection accuracy is greater than that
   of models using other features, suggesting that malware detection based
   on a graph structure and GNNs has a lot of space for future study.},

Abstract = {This paper provides a systematic analysis of existing resource
   platforms, evaluating their advantages and drawbacks with respect to
   data privacy protection. To address the privacy and security risks
   associated with resource platform data, we propose a novel privacy
   protection algorithm based on chunking disorder. Our algorithm exchanges
   data within a specific range of chunk size for the position and combines
   the chunked data with the MD5 value in a differential way, thus ensuring
   data privacy. To ensure the security of the algorithm, we also discuss
   the importance of preventing client and server decompilation during its
   implementation. The findings of our experiments are as follows. Our
   proposed privacy-preserving algorithm is extremely secure and easy to
   implement. Our algorithm has a significant avalanche effect, maintaining
   values of 0.61-0.85, with information entropy being maintained at
   4.5-4.9. This indicates that our algorithm is highly efficient without
   compromising data security. Furthermore, our algorithm has strong
   encryption and decryption time stability. The key length can be up to
   594 bits, rendering it challenging to decrypt. Compared with the
   traditional DES algorithm, our algorithm has better security under the
   same conditions and approaches the levels of security offered by the AES
   and RC4 algorithms.},

Title = {Optimizing smart contract vulnerability detection via multi-modality
   code and entropy embedding},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {202},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Smart contracts have been widely used in the blockchain world these
   years, and simultaneously vulner-ability detection has gained more and
   more attention due to the staggering economic losses caused by the
   attacker. Existing tools that analyze vulnerabilities for smart
   contracts heavily rely on rules predefined by experts, which are
   labour-intense and require domain knowledge. Moreover, predefined rules
   tend to be misconceptions and increase the risk of crafty potential
   back-doors in the future. Recently, researchers mainly used static and
   dynamic execution analysis to detect the vulnerabilities of smart
   contracts and have achieved acceptable results. However, the dynamic
   method cannot cover all the program inputs and execution paths, which
   leads to some vulnerabilities that are hard to detect. The static
   analysis method commonly includes symbolic execution and theorem
   proving, which requires using constraints to detect vulnerability. These
   shortcomings show that traditional methods are challenging to apply and
   expand on a large scale. This paper aims to detect vulnerabilities via
   the Bug Injection framework and transfer learning techniques. First, we
   train a Transformer encoder using multi-modality code, which contains
   source code, intermediate representation, and assembly code. The input
   code consists separately of Solidity source code, intermediate
   representation, and assembly code. Specifically, we translate source
   code into the intermediate representation and decompile the byte code
   into assembly code by the EVM compiler. Then, we propose a novel entropy
   embedding technique, which combines token embedding, segment embedding,
   and positional embedding of the Transformer encoder in our approach.
   After that, we utilize the Bug Injection framework to automatically
   generate specific types of buggy code for fine-tuning and evaluating the
   performance of vulnerability detection. The experimental results show
   that our proposed approach improves the performance in detecting
   reentrancy vulnerabilities and timestamp dependence. Moreover, our
   approach is more flexible and scalable than static and dynamic analysis
   approaches in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. Our approach
   improves the baseline approaches by an average of 11.89\% in term of F1
   score.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Lightweight and Multi-Stage Approach for Android Malware Detection
   Using Non-Invasive Machine Learning Techniques},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {73127-73144},
Abstract = {Android has been a constant target of cybercriminals that try to attack
   one of the most used operating systems, commonly using malicious
   applications (denominated malware) that, once installed on a device, can
   harm users in several ways. Existing malware detection solutions are
   usually invasive as they obtain classification features by performing
   reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of the analyzed
   application, which infringes licenses and terms of use of applications.
   In addition, these solutions often employ a single machine learning (ML)
   model to detect various types of malware, resulting in several false
   alarms. In this context, we propose an approach to detect Android
   malware consisting of a set of specific-type detectors in which each one
   performs a multi-stage analysis, based on rules and ML techniques, in
   different phases of the application cycle (before and after its
   installation). Our approach also differs from state-of-the-art solutions
   by being non-invasive, since it leverages a process to obtain
   application's features that does not infringe licenses and terms of use
   of applications. In addition, according to experiments performed on a
   real Android smartphone, our proposal presents the following additional
   advantages over state-of-the-art solutions: a more efficient process to
   classify applications that is three times faster and requires ten times
   less CPU usage in some cases (saving device energy); and a better
   detection performance, with higher balanced accuracy, nine times less
   false positive cases, and ten times less false negative cases.},

Title = {Android Ransomware Analysis Using Convolutional Neural Network and Fuzzy
   Hashing Features},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {121724-121738},
Abstract = {Most of the time, cybercriminals look for new ways to bypass security
   controls by improving their attacks. In the 1980s, attackers developed
   malware to kidnap user data by requesting payments. Malware is called a
   ransomware. Recently, they have demanded payment in Bitcoin or any other
   cryptocurrency. Ransomware is one of the most dangerous threats on the
   Internet, and this type of malware could affect almost all devices.
   Malware cipher device data, making them inaccessible to users. In this
   study, a new method for Android ransomware classification was proposed.
   This method implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for malware
   classification based on images. This paper presents a novel method for
   transforming an Android Application Package (APK) into a grayscale
   image. The image creation relies on using Natural Language Processing
   (NLP) techniques for text cleaning and Fuzzy Hashing to represent the
   decompiled code from the APK in a set of hashes after preprocessing
   using NLP techniques. The image is composed of n fuzzy hashes that
   represent the APK. The method was tested using a dataset of 7,765
   Android ransomware samples obtained from external researchers and public
   sources. The accuracy of the proposed method was higher than that of
   other methods in the literature.},

Title = {Analyzing syntactic constructs of Java programs with machine learning},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {215},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The massive number of open-source projects in public repositories has
   notably increased in the last years. Such repositories represent
   valuable information to be mined for different purposes, such as
   documenting recurrent syntactic constructs, analyzing the particular
   constructs used by experts and beginners, using them to teach
   programming and to detect bad programming practices, and building
   programming tools such as decompilers, Integrated Development
   Environments or Intelligent Tutoring Systems. An inherent problem of
   source code is that its syntactic information is represented with tree
   structures, while traditional machine learning algorithms use
   n-dimensional datasets. Therefore, we present a feature engineering
   process to translate tree structures into homogeneous and heterogeneous
   n-dimensional datasets to be mined. Then, we run different interpretable
   (supervised and unsupervised) machine learning algorithms to mine the
   syntactic information of more than 17 million syntactic constructs in
   Java code. The results reveal interesting information such as the Java
   constructs that are barely (and widely) used (e.g., bitwise operators,
   union types and static blocks), different language features and patterns
   mostly (and barely) used by beginners (and experts), the discovery of
   particular types of source code (e.g., helper or utility classes, data
   transfer objects and too complex abstractions), and how complexity is an
   inherent characteristic in some clusters of syntactic constructs.},

Title = {Predicting Android malware combining permissions and API call sequences},
Journal = {SOFTWARE QUALITY JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Pages = {655-685},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Malware detection is an important task in software maintenance. It can
   effectively protect user information from the attack of malicious
   developers. Existing studies mainly focus on leveraging permission
   information and API call information to identify malware. However, many
   studies pay attention to the API call without considering the role of
   API call sequences. In this study, we propose a new method by combining
   both the permission information and the API call sequence information to
   distinguish malicious applications from benign applications. First, we
   extract features of permission and API call sequence with a decompiling
   tool. Then, one-hot encoding and Word2Vec are adopted to represent the
   permission feature and the API call sequence feature for each
   application, respectively. Based on this, we leverage Random Forest (RF)
   and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a permission-based
   classifier and an API call sequence-based classifier, respectively.
   Finally, we design a linear strategy to combine the outputs of these two
   classifiers to predict the labels of newly arrived applications. By an
   evaluation with 15,198 malicious applications and 15,129 benign
   applications, our approach achieves 98.84\% in terms of precision,
   98.17\% in terms of recall, 98.50\% in terms of F1-score, and 98.52\% in
   terms of accuracy on average, and outperforms the state-of-art method
   Malscan by 2.12\%, 0.27\%, 1.20\%, and 1.24\%, respectively. In
   addition, we demonstrate that the method combining two features achieves
   better performance than the methods based on a single feature.},

Abstract = {Much software, whether beneficent or malevolent, is distributed only as
   binaries, sans source code. Absent source code, understanding binaries'
   behavior can be quite challenging, especially when compiled under higher
   levels of compiler optimization. These optimizations can transform
   comprehensible, ``natural{''} source constructions into something
   entirely unrecognizable. Reverse engineering binaries, especially those
   suspected of being malevolent or guilty of intellectual property theft,
   are important and time-consuming tasks. There is a great deal of
   interest in tools to ``decompile{''} binaries back into more natural
   source code to aid reverse engineering. Decompilation involves several
   desirable steps, including recreating source-language constructions,
   variable names, and perhaps even comments. One central step in creating
   binaries is optimizing function calls, using steps such as inlining.
   Recovering these (possibly inlined) function calls from optimized
   binaries is an essential task that most state-of-the-art decompiler
   tools try to do but do not perform very well. In this paper, we evaluate
   a supervised learning approach to the problem of recovering optimized
   function calls. We leverage open-source software and develop an
   automated labeling scheme to generate a reasonably large dataset of
   binaries labeled with actual function usages. We augment this large but
   limited labeled dataset with a pre-training step, which learns the
   decompiled code statistics from a much larger unlabeled dataset. Thus
   augmented, our learned labeling model can be combined with an existing
   decompilation tool, Ghidra, to achieve substantially improved
   performance in function call recovery, especially at higher levels of
   optimization.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Context: Due to the change and advancement in technology, day by day the
   internet service usages are also increasing. Smartphones have become the
   necessity for every person these days. It is used to perform all basic
   daily activities such as calling, SMS, banking, gaming, entertainment,
   education, etc. Therefore, malware authors are developing new variants
   of malwares or malicious applications especially for monetary benefits.
   Objective: Objective of this research paper is to develop a technique
   that can be used to detect malwares or malicious applications on the
   android devices that will work for all types of packed or encrypted
   malicious applications, which usually evade decompiling tools.
   Method: In the proposed approach, visualization method is used for the
   detection of malware. In the first phase, application files are
   converted into images and then in second phase, texture feature of
   images are extracted using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). In
   the last phase, machine learning classification algorithms are used to
   classify the malicious and benign applications.
   Results: The proposed approach is rim on different datasets collected
   from various repositories. Different efficiency parameters are
   calculated and the proposed approach is compared with the existing
   approaches.
   Conclusion: We have proposed a static technique for efficient detection
   of malwares. The proposed technique performs better than the existing
   technique.},

Title = {Research on the Construction of Malware Variant Datasets and Their
   Detection Method},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Malware detection is of great significance for maintaining the security
   of information systems. Malware obfuscation techniques and malware
   variants are increasingly emerging, but their samples and API
   (application programming interface) sequences are difficult to obtain.
   This poses difficulties for the development of malware variant detection
   models. To address this issue in this paper, we first generated a
   malware variant dataset using the obfuscation technique based on the
   disassembly and decompilation of malware. Then, an API call dataset of
   these malware variants was constructed through sandboxing. Compared to
   similar work, the malware variants and their obfuscated API call
   sequences generated in this paper were all runnable. After that, taking
   a public API call sequence dataset of obfuscation-free malware as input,
   a BERT (bidirectional encoder representation from transformers)
   pretrained model for malware detection was constructed. To enhance the
   ability of this pretrained model to handle obfuscation and variants, in
   this paper, we used adversarial training to improve the robustness and
   generalization of the detection model under obfuscation. As the
   experimental results show, the proposed scheme can improve the

Title = {Deep Learning-Based Multi-classification for Malware Detection in IoT},

Abstract = {Due to the open-source and versatility of the Android operating system,
   Android malware has exploded, and the malware detection of Android IoT
   devices has become a research hotspot in recent years. Static analysis
   technology cannot effectively analyze obfuscated malware. Without
   decomposing, the existing detection methods are mainly based on
   grayscale images and single files without analyzing and verifying their
   anti-obfuscation performance. In addition, the current detection of
   Android malware using deep learning is concentrated in the field of
   binary classification. This paper proposes a multi-classification method
   of the Android malware family based on multi-class feature files and RGB
   images to solve these problems. The method proposed in this paper does
   not need to decompile the Android APK installation package. However, it
   extracts the DEX file and XML file in batch from the APK installation
   package. Then, it converts the file into an RGB image using the
   conversion algorithm that converts Android software into images.
   Finally, the deep neural network automatically obtains the RGB image
   texture features to realize the multiple classifications of the Android
   malware family. Experimental data show that the proposed method has high
   detection performance, and the accuracy of multiple classifications of
   the Android malware family is as high as 99.84\%. In addition, the
   method based on RGB image is better than the gray-scale image in
   detection accuracy, and the effect of RGB image combined with DEX and
   XML is better than that of separate DEX file image and separate XML file
   image. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can effectively
   detect the obfuscated Android malware, and the detection accuracy of
   99.23\% can be achieved for the obfuscated sample data. Furthermore,
   this method has good anti-obfuscation ability. The proposed method is
   compared with those based on Multi-Layer Perceptron, Long Short-Term
   Memory, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Deep Belief Network.
   The experimental results show the proposed method's effectiveness and
   high generalization performance.},

Abstract = {The arrival of the Bourbons to the Hispanic Monarchy brought with it new
   ways of conceiving of the society attached to its body politic. New laws
   and rights were promoted, which motivated among the free population a

   Hispanic America. In this sense, the present work attempts to approach
   the case of the integration and recognition of the free population of
   the city of Caloto, And the contiguous seat of Quilichao. The analysis
   of the census carried out in the year 1784 in Caloto and of the
   decompiled documentation of the General Archive of the Nation, from the
   colony section (Cauca populations) allows the observation and
   identification that in the framework of the interwoven relationships of
   the free or mestizo population there were some activities that

Abstract = {Mobile malware is malicious software designed specifically for targeting
   various mobile gadgets like tablets, smartphones, and so forth, in which
   any type of malicious code affecting the mobile devices without the
   knowledge of the user. The increasing number of users encourages the
   hacker for generating various malware applications. Therefore, in this
   paper, we utilized three vital phases namely the pre-processing process,
   Feature extraction process as well as classification process in which
   the malicious data are detected. In the pre-processing phase, an
   Androguard tool is used for decompiling and disassembling the android
   applications. The API call features are extracted in the feature
   extraction phase and in the classification phase, long short term memory
   based electro search optimization (LSTM-ESO) is employed to detect the
   unknown mobile applications as benign or malicious. The malicious mobile
   detecting accuracy deals in requesting permission and exhibiting
   malicious code applications. In order to enhance the identification of
   various malware applications, this paper utilized frequency analysis and
   permissions of API calls. Finally, the experimental analysis is
   performed by evaluating the performance measures like accuracy,
   precision, recall, and F-measure. From the evaluation outcome, it is
   observed that the classification accuracy obtained is 97.69\%.},

Abstract = {Software piracy is an act of illegal stealing and distributing
   commercial software either for revenue or identify theft. Pirated
   applications on Android app stores are harming developers and their
   users by clone scammers. The scammers usually generate pirated versions
   of the same applications and publish them in different open-source app
   stores. There is no centralized system between these app stores to
   prevent scammers from publishing pirated applications. As most of the
   app stores are hosted on cloud storage, therefore a cloud-based
   interaction system can prevent scammers from publishing pirated
   applications. In this paper, we proposed IoT-based cloud architecture
   for clone detection using program dependency analysis. First, the newly
   submitted APK and possible original files are selected from app stores.
   The APK Extractor and JDEX decompiler extract APK and DEX files for Java
   source code analysis. The dependency graphs of Java files are generated
   to extract a set of weighted features. The Stacked-Long Short-Term
   Memory (S-LSTM) deep learning model is designed to predict possible
   clones.
   Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach can achieve
   an average accuracy of 95.48\% among clones from different application
   stores.},

Abstract = {Cyberattacks are increasing in both number and severity for private,
   corporate, and governmental bodies. To prevent these attacks, many
   intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems provide
   computer security by monitoring network packets and auditing system
   records. However, most of these systems only monitor network packets
   rather than the computer itself, so physical intrusion is also an
   important security issue. Furthermore, with the rapid progress of the
   Internet of Things (IoT) technology, security problems of IoT devices
   are also increasing. Many IoT devices can be disassembled for
   decompilation, resulting in the theft of sensitive data. To prevent
   this, physical intrusion detection systems of the IoT should be
   considered. We here propose a physical security system that can protect
   data from unauthorized access when the computer chassis is opened or
   tampered with. Sensor switches monitor the chassis status at all times
   and upload event logs to a cloud server for remote monitoring. If the
   system finds that the computer has an abnormal condition, it takes
   protective measures and notifies the administrator. This system can be
   extended to IoT devices to protect their data from theft.},

Abstract = {Centrally controlled energy conversion schemes in intelligent
   residential microgrids are a difficult optimization challenge because of
   their range of processing and power devices accessible. Typical steps to
   shrink the weight and seriousness of the issues are decreasing modelling
   precision, adding several weights, or adjusting the measurement
   accuracy. Nevertheless, because these interventions modify the
   specialization issue and thus result in various approaches as expected,
   this article introduces a Bigdata assisted energy conversion model
   (BD-ECM) and evaluates a decomposition approach to solve the initial
   problem recursively. Compared to the initial compact version, the
   decayed approach is tested to demonstrate that all versions differ less
   than 18.8\%. Moreover, both methods contribute to the use of roughly
   similar structures. The results reveal that because of the existing
   constraints on computational capital and simulation techniques,
   condensed development of the common law can only be extended to moderate
   and limited intelligent grids. However, decentralized approaches can be
   dealing with sizeable dispersed generation structures. To assess the
   month's environmental and strategic advantages as part of the system,
   researchers extend the decompiled approach to a massive smart grid. The
   data reveal that prices can be lowered by 14.0\% in local energy
   exchanges and pollution by 23.9\% in the situation studied.},

   technology, the threat of malicious software grows more and more
   serious. In the field of information security, malware detection has
   been a key problem that academia and industry are committed to solving.
   Machine learning is an effective method for processing large-scale data,
   such as the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and deep neural
   network technology. Although these types of detection methods can deal
   with cyber threats, most feature extraction methods are based on the
   statistical information features of portable executable (PE) files and
   thus lack the decompiled code and execution flow structure of the PE
   samples. Therefore, we propose a Control-Flow Graph (CFG)- and Graph
   Isomorphism Network (GIN)-based malware classification system. The
   feature vectors of CFG basic blocks are generated using the large-scale
   pre-trained language model MiniLM, which is beneficial for the GIN to
   further learn and compress the CFG-based representation, and classified
   with multi-layer perceptron. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness
   of the representation under different dimensions and classifiers. To
   evaluate our method, we set up a CFG-based malware detection graph
   dataset from a PE file of the Blue Hexagon Open Dataset for Malware
   Analysis (BODMAS), which we call the Malware Geometric Binary Dataset
   (MGD-BINARY) and collected the experimental results of CFG
   representation in different dimensions and classifier settings. The
   evaluation results show that our proposal has proved an Accuracy metric
   of 0.99160 and achieved 0.99148 Area Under the Curve (AUC) results.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Pages = {92505-92515},
Abstract = {Aiming at the problems of coupling between transformer input
   characteristics and low accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, SSA-MDS
   and other soft technologies are used to analyze the key characteristics
   of transformer faults, so as to improve the accuracy of transformer
   fault diagnosis. The SSA algorithm cascade MDS algorithm to process the
   DGA data is proposed. Subsequently, the TSSA-RF model is introduced to
   classify the DGA data. The DGA data is first mapped to a
   high-dimensional space. Next, the optimal feature subset is encoded
   using the SSA algorithm to reduce irrelevant and redundant features. In
   this study, the correlation between the optimal feature dimension and
   the transformer fault diagnosis accuracy is investigated. the expression
   of the optimal feature subset is obtained by decompiling the SSA
   operator. The pre-processed data are classified using the RF model, and
   the TSSA -RF model for classifying the DGA data is found with the
   highest accuracy through the comparison of different optimization
   algorithms. After the RF model is optimized using the TSSA algorithm,
   its accuracy increases by 7.89\%, and the accuracy of the TSSA -RF model
   is obtained as 92.11\%. The example results show that compared with the
   original data, the proposed data processing algorithm improves the
   diagnostic accuracy of transformer by 11.97 \% in the RF model. Compared
   with multiple preprocessing methods, SSA-MDS has the highest accuracy.
   Compared with the original data, the accuracy of TSSA-RF model increases
   by 11.64 \%.},

Abstract = {Many internet artworks from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s used Adobe
   Flash technology for creating animated content. However, in the light of
   recent web standard developments (HTML5), Adobe has stopped supporting
   Flash and its related tools. The removal of Flash has made those net
   artworks non-functional and unviewable, including Sinae Kim's Genesis
   (2001), the focus of this study. Recently proposed emulation- and
   virtualisation-based strategies are not always suitable, particularly if
   there is a desire to keep the artwork on the `live web'. This article
   outlines an alternative method of migration facilitated by reverse
   engineering techniques-specifically decompilation-and foregrounds the
   significance of maintaining online access to the obsolete Adobe
   Shockwave Flash (SWF) files through the source code. On this premise,
   the source code is re-imagined as a site for further re-enactment,
   allowing a departure from its current role as a marker of
   `authenticity'.},

Title = {A Method for Class-Imbalance Learning in Android Malware Detection},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {More and more Android application developers are adopting many different
   methods against reverse engineering, such as adding a shell, resulting
   in certain features that cannot be obtained through decompilation, which
   causes a serious sample imbalance in Android malware detection based on
   machine learning. Hence, the researchers have focused on how to solve
   class-imbalance to improve the performance of Android malware detection.
   However, the disadvantages of the existing class-imbalance learning are
   mainly the loss of valuable samples and the computational cost. In this
   paper, we propose a method of Class-Imbalance Learning (CIL), which
   first selects representative features, uses the clustering K-Means
   algorithm and under-sampling to retain the important samples of the
   majority class while reducing the number of samples of the majority
   class. After that, we use the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique
   (SMOTE) algorithm to generate minority class samples for data balance,
   and finally use the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to build a malware
   detection model. The result of experiments indicates that CIL
   effectively improves the performance of Android malware detection based
   on machine learning, especially for class imbalance. Compared with
   existing class-imbalance learning methods, CIL is also effective for the
   Machine Learning Repository from the University of California, Irvine
   (UCI) and has better performance in some data sets.},

Title = {Learning-Based Detection for Malicious Android Application Using Code
   Vectorization},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {The malicious APK (Android Application Package) makers use some
   techniques such as code obfuscation and code encryption to avoid
   existing detection methods, which poses new challenges for accurate
   virus detection and makes it more and more difficult to detect the
   malicious code. A report indicates that a new malicious app for Android
   is created every 10 seconds. To combat this serious malware activity, a
   scalable malware detection approach is needed, which can effectively and
   efficiently identify the malware apps. Common static detection methods
   often rely on Hash matching and analysis of viruses, which cannot
   quickly detect new malicious Android applications and their variants. In
   this paper, a malicious Android application detection method is
   proposed, which is implemented by the deep network fusion model. The
   hybrid model only needs to use the sample training model to achieve high
   accuracy in the identification of the malicious applications, which is
   more suitable for the detection of the new malicious Android
   applications than the existing methods. This method extracts the static
   features in the core code of the Android application by decompiling APK
   files, then performs code vectorization processing, and uses the deep
   learning network for classification and discrimination. Our experiments
   with a data set containing 10,170 apps show that the decisions from the
   hybrid model can increase the malware detection rate significantly on a
   real device, which verifies the superiority of this method in the
   detection of malicious codes.},

Abstract = {Many researchers analyze malware through static analysis and dynamic

   algorithm, which has achieved good results in malware classification.
   However, many researches only use the. ASM file generated by decompiler

   paper fully integrates the features of these two files, and uses word
   frequency and two deep learning algorithms to extract 184 opcode
   features and 16 probability features from ASM file and section file of
   Kaggle dataset respectively. Then, double byte feature coding method is
   used to fuse the features of the two files. Finally, convolution neural
   network is used to classify the fused samples. The experimental results
   show that the accuracy is 98.68\% and the logarithm loss is 0.022. (C)

Abstract = {The Big Code and Mining Software Repositories research lines analyze
   large amounts of source code to improve software engineering practices.
   Massive codebases are used to train machine learning models aimed at
   improving the software development process. One example is
   decompilation, where C code and its compiled binaries can be used to
   train machine learning models to improve decompilation. However,
   obtaining massive codebases of portable C code is not an easy task,
   since most applications use particular libraries, operating systems, or
   language extensions. In this paper, we present Cnerator, a Python
   application that provides the stochastic generation of large amounts of
   standard C code. It is highly configurable, allowing the user to specify
   the probability distributions of each language construct, properties of
   the generated code, and post-processing modifications of the output
   programs. Cnerator has been successfully used to generate code that,
   utilized to train machine learning models, has improved the performance
   of existing decompilers. It has also been used in the implementation of
   an infrastructure for the automatic extraction of code patterns. (C)

Abstract = {As mobile phone is widely used in social network communication, it
   attracts numerous malicious attacks, which seriously threaten users'
   personal privacy and data security. To improve the resilience to attack
   technologies, structural information analysis has been widely applied in
   mobile malware detection. However, the rapid improvement of mobile
   applications has brought an impressive growth of their internal
   structure in scale and attack technologies. It makes the timely analysis
   of structural information and malicious feature generation a heavy
   burden. In this paper, we propose a new Android malware identification
   approach based on malicious subgraph mining to improve the detection
   performance of large-scale graph structure analysis. Firstly, function
   call graphs (FCGs), sensitive permissions, and application programming
   interfaces (APIs) are generated from the decompiled files of malware.
   Secondly, two kinds of malicious subgraphs are generated from malware's
   decompiled files and put into the feature set. At last, test
   applications' safety can be automatically identified and classified into
   malware families by matching their FCGs with malicious structural
   features. To evaluate our approach, a dataset of 11,520 malware and
   benign applications is established. Experimental results indicate that
   our approach has better performance than three previous works and
   Androguard.},

Abstract = {Control flow-based feature extraction method has the ability to detect
   malicious code with higher accuracy than traditional text-based methods.
   Unfortunately, this method has been encountered with the NP-hard
   problem, which is infeasible for the large-sized and high-complexity
   programs. To tackle this, we propose a control flow-based feature
   extraction dynamic programming algorithm for fast extraction of control
   flow-based features with polynomial time O(N-2), where N is the number
   of basic blocks in decompiled executable codes. From the experimental
   results, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is more
   efficient and effective in detecting malware than the existing ones.
   Applying our algorithm to an Internet of Things dataset gives better
   results on three measures: Accuracy = 99.05\%, False Positive Rate =
   1.31\% and False Negative Rate = 0.66\%.},

Title = {ProDroid - An Android malware detection framework based on profile

Journal = {PERVASIVE AND MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {72},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Popularity and openness have made the Android platform a potential
   target of malware attacks. The hackers continuously evolve and improve
   attacking strategies to identify vulnerabilities in newer Android
   versions. Detection and analysis of malware attacks in Android platform
   pose unique challenges due to the security restrictions and resource
   limitations present in these devices. This paper proposes a new
   behavioural method for Android malware detection and classification. In
   the proposed approach, the Android malware dataset is decompiled to
   identify the suspicious API classes/methods and generated an encoded
   list. The multiple sequence alignment for different malware families is
   created using the encoded patterns and it is further applied to generate
   profile hidden Markov model. The model classifies an unknown application
   as benign or malicious based on the log likelihood score generated. The
   framework provides an accuracy of 94.5\%, which is relatively higher
   compared to existing similar frameworks for detection of android
   malware. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Batik is a traditional handicraft of ethnic minorities in southwestern
   China's Guizhou province. It carries distinctive features, and inherits
   profound artistic and cultural values. However, the empirical design
   model of batik patterns is not fast or diverse enough to meet the highly
   personalized market demands. Moreover, it is difficult to parametrize
   the complex ethnic patterns with mathematical models. Hence, the design
   of batik patterns cannot satisfy the visual cognitive needs of
   consumers, which are constantly changing, fuzzy, and personalized. In
   other words, the visual cognitive needs of consumers have not been fully
   considered in the parametrization and design of batik patterns. To solve
   the problem, this paper puts forward a generative design method for
   batik patterns based on shape grammar, and relies on the artificial
   neural network (ANN) to model the nonlinear mapping between design
   parameters and visual cognitive image (VCI) values. The three-layer ANN
   model was optimized with the genetic algorithm (GA) to generate new
   patterns, and optimize the composition of their VCIs. The workflow and
   effectiveness of the proposed method were explained and verified through
   experiments on the generative design of bronze drum patterns, which have
   rich ethnic and religious connotations. The experimental results show
   that our method can predict the VCI values of the composition, provide
   the optimal parameter solution of the VCI values, and decompile the
   conceptual prototype from the pattern composition that best meets the
   visual cognitive needs of consumers. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {The protection and privacy of the 5G-IoT framework is a major challenge
   due to the vast number of mobile devices. Specialized applications
   running these 5G-IoT systems may be vulnerable to clone attacks. Cloning
   applications can be achieved by stealing or distributing commercial
   Android apps to harm the advanced services of the 5G-IoT framework.
   Meanwhile, most Android app stores run and manage Android apps that
   developers have submitted separately without any central verification
   systems. Android scammers sell pirated versions of commercial software
   to other app stores under different names. Android applications are
   typically stored on cloud servers, while API access services may be used
   to detect and prevent cloned applications from being released. In this
   paper, we proposed a hybrid approach to the Control Flow Graph (CFG) and
   a deep learning model to secure the smart services of the 5G-IoT
   framework. First, the newly submitted APK file is extracted and the JDEX
   decompiler is used to retrieve Java source files from possibly original
   and cloned applications. Second, the source files are broken down into
   various android-based components. After generating Control-Flow Graphs
   (CFGs), the weighted features are stripped from each component. Finally,
   the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is designed to predict potential
   cloned applications by training features from different components of
   android applications. Experimental results have shown that the proposed
   approach can achieve an average accuracy of 96.24\% for cloned
   applications selected from different android application stores.},

Title = {FWS: Analyzing, maintaining and transcompiling firewalls},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SECURITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {29},
Number = {1},
Pages = {77-134},
Abstract = {Firewalls are essential for managing and protecting computer networks.
   They permit specifying which packets are allowed to enter a network, and
   also how these packets are modified by IP address translation and port
   redirection. Configuring a firewall is notoriously hard, and one of the
   reasons is that it requires using low level, hard to interpret,
   configuration languages. Equally difficult are policy maintenance and
   refactoring, as well as porting a configuration from one firewall system
   to another.
   To address these issues we introduce a pipeline that assists system
   administrators in checking if: (i) the intended security policy is
   actually implemented by a configuration; (ii) two configurations are
   equivalent; (iii) updates have the desired effect on the firewall
   behavior; (iv) there are useless or redundant rules; additionally, an
   administrator can (v) transcompile a configuration into an equivalent
   one in a different language; and (vi) maintain a configuration using a
   generic, declarative language that can be compiled into different target
   languages.
   The pipeline is based on IFCL, an intermediate firewall language
   equipped with a formal semantics, and it is implemented in an open
   source tool called FWS. In particular, the first stage decompiles real
   firewall configurations for iptables, ipfw, pf and (a subset of) Cisco
   IOS into IFCL. The second one transforms an IFCL configuration into a
   logical predicate and uses the Z3 solver to synthesize an abstract
   specification that succinctly represents the firewall behavior. System
   administrators can use FWS to analyze the firewall by posing SQL-like
   queries, and update the configuration to meet the desired security
   requirements. Finally, the last stage allows for maintaining a
   configuration by acting directly on its abstract specification and then
   compiling it to the chosen target language. Tests on real firewall
   configurations show that FWS can be fruitfully used in real-world
   scenarios.},

Title = {Android Malware Detection Based on Structural Features of the Function
   Call Graph},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The openness of Android operating system not only brings convenience to
   users, but also leads to the attack threat from a large number of
   malicious applications (apps). Thus malware detection has become the
   research focus in the field of mobile security. In order to solve the
   problem of more coarse-grained feature selection and larger feature loss
   of graph structure existing in the current detection methods, we put
   forward a method named DGCNDroid for Android malware detection, which is
   based on the deep graph convolutional network. Our method starts by
   generating a function call graph for the decompiled Android application.
   Then the function call subgraph containing the sensitive application
   programming interface (API) is extracted. Finally, the function call
   subgraphs with structural features are trained as the input of the deep
   graph convolutional network. Thus the detection and classification of
   malicious apps can be realized. Through experimentation on a dataset
   containing 11,120 Android apps, the method proposed in this paper can
   achieve detection accuracy of 98.2\%, which is higher than other
   existing detection methods.},

Title = {A Forensic Disassembly of the BIS Monitor},
Journal = {ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {131},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1923-1933},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND:
   The bispectral index (BIS) monitor has been available for clinical use
   for >20 years and has had an immense impact on academic activity in
   Anesthesiology, with >3000 articles referencing the bispectral index.
   Despite attempts to infer its algorithms by external observation, its
   operation has nevertheless remained undescribed, in contrast to the
   algorithms of other less commercially successful monitors of
   electroencephalogram (EEG) activity under anesthesia. With the
   expiration of certain key patents, the time is therefore ripe to examine
   the operation of the monitor on its own terms through careful
   dismantling, followed by extraction and examination of its internal
   software.
   METHODS:
   An A-2000 BIS Monitor (gunmetal blue case, amber monochrome display) was
   purchased on the secondary market. After identifying the major data
   processing and storage components, a set of free or inexpensive tools
   was used to retrieve and disassemble the monitor's onboard software. The
   software executes primarily on an ARMv7 microprocessor (Sharp/NXP
   LH77790B) and a digital signal processor (Texas Instruments TMS320C32).
   The device software can be retrieved directly from the monitor's
   hardware by using debugging interfaces that have remained in place from
   its original development.
   RESULTS:
   Critical numerical parameters such as the spectral edge frequency (SEF),
   total power, and BIS values were retraced from external delivery at the
   device's serial port back to the point of their calculation in the
   extracted software. In doing so, the locations of the critical
   algorithms were determined. To demonstrate the validity of the
   technique, the algorithms for SEF and total power were disassembled,
   comprehensively annotated and compared to their theoretically ideal
   behaviors. A bug was identified in the device's implementation of the
   SEF algorithm, which can be provoked by a perfectly isoelectric EEG.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   This article demonstrates that the electronic design of the A-2000 BIS
   Monitor does not pose any insuperable obstacles to retrieving its device
   software in hexadecimal machine code form directly from the motherboard.
   This software can be reverse engineered through disassembly and
   decompilation to reveal the methods by which the BIS monitor implements
   its algorithms, which ultimately must form the definitive statement of
   its function. Without further revealing any algorithms that might be
   considered trade secrets, the manufacturer of the BIS monitor should be
   encouraged to release the device software in its original format to
   place BIS-related academic literature on a firm theoretical foundation
   and to promote further academic development of EEG monitoring
   algorithms.},

Title = {Malware Classification Based on Shallow Neural Network},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The emergence of a large number of new malicious code poses a serious
   threat to network security, and most of them are derivative versions of
   existing malicious code. The classification of malicious code is helpful
   to analyze the evolutionary trend of malicious code families and trace
   the source of cybercrime. The existing methods of malware classification
   emphasize the depth of the neural network, which has the problems of a
   long training time and large computational cost. In this work, we
   propose the shallow neural network-based malware classifier (SNNMAC), a
   malware classification model based on shallow neural networks and static
   analysis. Our approach bridges the gap between precise but slow methods
   and fast but less precise methods in existing works. For each sample, we
   first generate n-grams from their opcode sequences of the binary file
   with a decompiler. An improved n-gram algorithm based on control
   transfer instructions is designed to reduce the n-gram dataset. Then,
   the SNNMAC exploits a shallow neural network, replacing the full
   connection layer and softmax with the average pooling layer and
   hierarchical softmax, to learn from the dataset and perform
   classification. We perform experiments on the Microsoft malware dataset.
   The evaluation result shows that the SNNMAC outperforms most of the
   related works with 99.21\% classification precision and reduces the
   training time by more than half when compared with the methods using DNN
   (Deep Neural Networks).},

Abstract = {Purpose The online platform is one of the essential components of the
   platform economy that is constructed by a large scale of the personal
   data resource. However, accurate empirical test of the competition
   structure of the data-driven online platform is still less. This
   research is trying to reveal market allocation structure of the personal
   data resource of China's car-hailing platforms competition by the
   empirical data analysis. Design/methodology/approach This research is
   applying the social network analysis by R packages, which include k-core
   decomposition and multilevel community detection from the data
   connectedness via the decompilation and the examination of the
   application programming interface of terminal applications. Findings
   This research has found that the car-hailing platforms, which establish
   more constant personal data connectedness and connectivity with social
   media platforms, are taking the competitive market advantage within the
   sample network. Data access discrimination is a complementary method of
   market power in China's car-hailing industry. Research
   limitations/implications This research offers a new perspective on the
   analysis of the multi-sided market from the personal data resource
   allocation mechanism of the car-hailing platform. However, the
   measurement of the data connectedness requires more empirical industry
   data. Practical implications This research reveals the competition
   structure that relies on personal data resource allocation mechanism. It
   offers empirical evidence for governance, which is considered as the
   critical issue of big data research, by reviewing the nature of the data
   network. Social implications It also reveals the data convergence
   process of the social system and the technological system.
   Originality/value This research offers a new research method for the
   real-time regulation of the car-hailing platform.},

Title = {Taming Callbacks for Smart Contract Modularity},
Journal = {PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM ON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES-PACMPL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Callbacks are an effective programming discipline for implementing
   event-driven programming, especially in environments like Ethereum which
   forbid shared global state and concurrency. Callbacks allow a callee to
   delegate the execution back to the caller. Though effective, they can
   lead to subtle mistakes principally in open environments where callbacks
   can be added in a new code. Indeed, several high profile bugs in smart
   contracts exploit callbacks. We present the first static technique
   ensuring modularity in the presence of callbacks and apply it to verify
   prominent smart contracts. Modularity ensures that external calls to
   other contracts cannot affect the behavior of the contract. Importantly,
   modularity is guaranteed without restricting programming.
   In general, checking modularity is undecidable -even for programs
   without loops. This paper describes an effective technique for soundly
   ensuring modularity harnessing SMT solvers. The main idea is to define a
   constructive version of modularity using commutativity and projection
   operations on program segments. We believe that this approach is also
   accessible to programmers, since counterexamples to modularity can be
   generated automatically by the SMT solvers, allowing programmers to
   understand and fix the error.
   We implemented our approach in order to demonstrate the precision of the
   modularity analysis and applied it to real smart contracts, including a
   subset of the 150 most active contracts in Ethereum. Our implementation
   decompiles bytecode programs into an intermediate representation and
   then implements the modularity checking using SMT queries. Overall, we
   argue that our experimental results indicate that the method can be
   applied to many realistic contracts, and that it is able to prove
   modularity where other methods fail.},

Title = {IoT-based green city architecture using secured and sustainable android
   services},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY \& INNOVATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Green and smart cities deliver services to their residents using mobile
   applications that make daily life more convenient. The privacy and
   security of these applications are significant in providing sustainable
   services in a green city. The software cloning is a severe threat which
   may breach the security and privacy of android applications. A centrally
   controlled and automated screening system across multiple app stores is
   inevitable to prevent the release of copyrighted or cloned copies of
   these apps. In this paper, we proposed IoT-enabled green city
   architecture for clone detection in android markets using a deep
   learning approach. First, the proposed system obtained an original APK
   file together with potential candidate cloned APKs via the cloud
   network. For each subject software, the system uses an APK Extractor
   tool to retrieve Dalvik Executable (DEX) files. The Jdex decompiler is
   utilized to retrieve Java source files through Dalvik Executables.
   Second, the AST features are extracted using ANother Tool for Language
   Recognition (ANTLR) parser. Third, the linear features are mined from
   these hierarchical structures, and Term Frequency Inverse Document
   Frequency (TFIDF) is applied to estimate the significance of each
   feature. Finally, the deep learning model is configured to detect cloned
   apps. The deep learning model is fine-tuned to get better accuracy. The
   proposed approach is analyzed on five different cloned applications
   collected from different android markets. The main objective of this
   system is to avoid the release of pirated apps with various pirated
   labels in multiple app markets. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem
   for smart contracts: full-fledged intercommunicating programs that
   capture the transaction logic of an account. A gas limit caps the
   execution of an Ethereum smart contract: instructions, when executed,
   consume gas, and the execution proceeds as long as gas is available.
   Gas-focused vulnerabilities permit an attacker to force key contract
   functionality to run out of gas-effectively performing a permanent
   denial-of-service attack on the contract. Such vulnerabilities are among
   the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior
   may be uncommon in nonattack scenarios and reasoning about these
   vulnerabilities is nontrivial.
   In this paper, we identify gas-focused vulnerabilities and present
   MadMax: a static program analysis technique that automatically detects
   gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. MadMax combines a
   smart contract decompiler and semantic queries in Datalog. Our approach
   captures high-level program modeling concepts (such as ``dynamic data
   structure storage{''} and ``safely resumable loops{''}) and delivers
   high precision and scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart
   contracts in the Ethereum blockchain in just 10 hours and flags
   vulnerabilities in contracts with a monetary value in billions of
   dollars. Manual inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that
   81\% of the sampled warnings do indeed lead to vulnerabilities.},

Abstract = {The number of malware has exploded due to the openness of the Android
   platform, and the endless stream of malware poses a threat to the
   privacy, tariffs, and device of mobile phone users. A novel Android
   mobile malware detection system is proposed, which employs an optimized
   deep convolutional neural network to learn from opcode sequences. The
   optimized convolutional neural network is trained multiple times by the
   raw opcode sequences extracted from the decompiled Android file, so that
   the feature information can be effectively learned and the malicious
   program can be detected more accurately. More critically, thek-max
   pooling method with better results is adopted in the pooling operation
   phase, which improves the detection effect of the proposed method. The
   experimental results show that the detection system achieved the
   accuracy of 99\%, which is 2\%-11\% higher than the accuracy of the
   machine learning detection algorithms when using the same data set. It
   also ensures that the indicators, such as F1-score, recall, and
   precision, are maintained above 97\%. Based on the detection system, a
   multi-data set comparison experiment is carried out. The introducedk-max
   pooling is deeply studied, and the effect ofkofk-max pooling on the

Title = {An accurate and efficient two-phase scheme for detecting Android cloned
   applications},

Abstract = {The fast-growing Android application market has attracted more and more
   application developers. However, many plagiarists use decompiled tools
   to modify original applications to get clones, which has become a
   serious threat. For detecting cloned applications, most of the existing
   schemes do not consider the detected accuracy and time consumption at
   the same time. In this article, we proposea two-phase detection scheme
   to achieve fast and accurate clone detection in large-scale
   applications. In the rapid screening phase, a fix-length minhash summary
   is constructed for each application and the locality-sensitive hashing
   (LSH) algorithm is used to obtain suspicious cloned applications
   quickly. In the accurate detection phase, by merging and pruning the
   layout and interaction information of all user interfaces (UIs) at the
   application runtime, we obtain the birthmark named merged layout tree
   (MLT), which can resist nested obfuscation and repacking attack.
   Finally, cloned apps are detected by calculating the similarity between
   MLTs from suspicious cloned apps. We evaluate our detection scheme in
   two app datasets (nearly 170,000 Android applications) and compare it
   with the state-of-the-art clone detection methods. Extensive experiments
   show that our method has high accuracy and efficiency for clone
   detection in large-scale apps.},

Title = {Preliminary Results on Different Text Processing Tasks Using
   Encoder-Decoder Networks and the Causal Feature Extractor},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Deep learning methods are gaining popularity in different application
   domains, and especially in natural language processing. It is commonly
   believed that using a large enough dataset and an adequate network
   architecture, almost any processing problem can be solved. A frequent
   and widely used typology is the encoder-decoder architecture, where the
   input data is transformed into an intermediate code by means of an
   encoder, and then a decoder takes this code to produce its output.
   Different types of networks can be used in the encoder and the decoder,
   depending on the problem of interest, such as convolutional neural
   networks (CNN) or long-short term memories (LSTM). This paper uses for
   the encoder a method recently proposed, called Causal Feature Extractor
   (CFE). It is based on causal convolutions (i.e., convolutions that
   depend only on one direction of the input), dilatation (i.e., increasing
   the aperture size of the convolutions) and bidirectionality (i.e.,
   independent networks in both directions). Some preliminary results are
   presented on three different tasks and compared with state-of-the-art
   methods: bilingual translation, LaTeX decompilation and audio
   transcription. The proposed method achieves promising results, showing
   its ubiquity to work with text, audio and images. Moreover, it has a
   shorter training time, requiring less time per iteration, and a good use
   of the attention mechanisms based on attention matrices.},

Title = {Compile-time code virtualization for android applications},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Infringing intellectual property by reverse analysis is a severe threat
   to Android applications. By replacing the program instructions with
   virtual instructions that an adversary is unfamiliar with, code
   obfuscation based on virtualization is a promising way of protecting
   Android applications against reverse engineering. However, the current
   code virtualization approaches for Android only target at the DEX
   bytecode level. The DEX file with the open file format and more semantic
   information makes the decode-dispatch pattern easier to expose, which
   has been identified as a severe vulnerability of security and can be
   exploited by various attacks. Further, decode-dispatch interpretation
   frequently uses indirect branches in this structure to introduce extra
   overhead. This paper presents a novel approach to transfer code
   virtualization from DEX level to native level, which possesses strong
   security strength and good stealth, with only modest cost. Our approach
   contains two components: pre-compilation and compile-time
   virtualization. Pre-compilation is designed for performance improvement
   by identifying and decompiling the critical functions which consume a
   significant fraction of execution time. Compile-time virtualization
   builds upon the widely used LLVM compiler framework. It automatically
   translates the DEX bytecode into the common LLVM intermediate
   representations where a unified code virtualization pass can be applied
   for DEX code. We have implemented a working prototype Dex2VM of our
   technique and applied it to eight representative Android applications.
   Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively
   protect the target code against a state-of-the-art code reverse
   engineering tool that is specifically designed for code virtualization,
   and it achieves good stealth with only modest cost. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Android malware detection method based on bytecode image},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING},
Year = {2020},
Month = {2020 JUN 12},
Abstract = {Traditional machine learning based malware detection methods often use
   decompiling techniques or dynamic monitoring techniques to extract the
   feature representation of malware. This procedure is time consuming and
   strongly depends on the skills of experts. In addition, malware can be
   packed or encrypted to evade the analysis of decompiling tools. To solve
   this issue, we propose a static detection method based on deep learning.
   We directly extract bytecode file from Android APK file, and convert the
   bytecode file into a two-dimensional bytecode matrix, then use the deep
   learning algorithm, convolution neural network (CNN), to train a
   detection model and apply it to classify malware. CNN can automatically
   learn features of bytecode file which can be used to recognize malware.
   The proposed detection model avoids the procedure for analyzing malware
   features and designing the feature representation of malware. The
   experimental results show the proposed method is effective to detect
   malware, especially malware encrypted using polymorphic techniques.},

Abstract = {Due to people in companies use mobile devices to access corporate data,
   attackers targeting corporate data use vulnerabilities in mobile
   devices. Most vulnerabilities in applications are caused by the
   carelessness of developers, and confused deputy attacks and data leak
   attacks using inter-application vulnerabilities are possible. These
   vulnerabilities are difficult to find through the single-application
   diagnostic tool that is currently being studied. This paper proposes a
   process to automate the decompilation of all the applications on a
   user's mobile device and a mechanism to find inter-application
   vulnerabilities. The mechanism generates a list and matrix, detailing
   the vulnerabilities in the mobile device. The proposed mechanism is
   validated through an experiment on an actual mobile device with four
   installed applications, and the results show that the mechanism can
   accurately capture all application risks as well as inter-application
   risks. Through this mechanism, users can expect to find the risks in
   their mobile devices in advance and prevent damage.},

Abstract = {Pirated application developers find an alternate way to publish pirated
   versions of the same Android mobile applications (apps) on different
   Android markets. Therefore, a centralized, automated scrutiny system
   among multiple app stores is inevitable to prevent publishing pirated or
   cloned version of these Android applications. In this paper, we proposed
   an Android clone detection system for Internet of things (IoT)
   (Droid-IoT) devices. First, the proposed system receives an original
   Android application package (APK) file along with possible candidate
   cloned APKs over the cloud network. The system uses an apkExtractor tool
   to extract Dalvik Executable (DEX) files for each subject program. The
   Jdex decompiler is used to extract Java source files from DEXs. Then,
   the bag-of-word model is used to extract tokenized features from source
   files. Further, the weighting filters are used to zoom the importance of
   each token. Moreover, Synthetic Minority Oversampling is applied to
   retrieve balanced features for better training of data. Finally,
   TensorFlow with Keras deep learning model is designed to predict clones
   in Android applications. The experimental results have shown that
   Droid-IoT can successfully detect cloned apps with an accuracy of up to
   96\%. The primary purpose of this system is to prevent the publishing of
   pirated apps among different app stores under different pirated names.},

Title = {SSLDetecter: Detecting SSL Security Vulnerabilities of Android
   Applications Based on a Novel Automatic Traversal Method},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Month = {OCT 31},
Abstract = {Android usually employs the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to
   protect the user's privacy in network transmission. However, developers
   may misuse SSL-related APIs, which would lead attackers to steal user's
   privacy through man-in-the-middle attacks. Existing methods based on
   static decompiling technology to detect SSL security vulnerabilities of
   Android applications cannot cope with the increasingly common packed
   applications. Meanwhile, dynamic analysis approaches have the
   disadvantages of excessive resource consumption and time-consuming. In
   this paper, we propose a dynamic method to solve this issue based on our
   novel automatic traversal model. At first, we propose several new
   traversal strategies to optimize the widget tree according to the user
   interface (UI) types and the interface state similarity. Furthermore, we
   develop a more granular traversal model by refining the traversal level
   from the Activity component to the Widget and implement a heuristic
   depth-first traversal algorithm in combination with our customized
   traversal strategy. In addition, the man-in-the-middle agent plug-in is
   extended to implement real-time attack test and return the attack
   results. Based on the above ideas, we have implemented SSLDetecter, an
   efficient automated detection system of Android application SSL security
   vulnerability. We apply it on multiple devices in parallel to detect
   2456 popular applications in several mainstream application markets and
   find that 424 applications are suffering from SSL security
   vulnerabilities. Compared with the existing system SMV-HUNTER, the time
   efficiency of our system increases by 38\% and the average detection
   rate increases by 6.39 percentage points, with many types of SSL
   vulnerabilities detected.},

Abstract = {Repackaging of applications is one of the key attack vectors for mobile
   malware. This is particularly easy and popular in Android Markets, where
   applications can be downloaded, decompiled, modified and re-uploaded at
   a very low cost. Detecting clones and victims is often a hard task,
   especially in markets with several million of applications to analyze,
   such as Google Play Store. This work proposes CloneSpot, a novel
   methodology to efficiently detect Repackaged versions of Android apps
   using Min Hashing techniques applied to applications' meta-data publicly
   available at Google Play. We validate our approach by analyzing 1.3
   Million of applications collected from Google Play in September 2017,
   from which around 420K are detected as potential repackaged or victim
   versions of other applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Polycyclic saturated heterocycles with predictable shapes and structures
   are assembled by iterative couplings of bifunctional stannyl amine
   protocol (SnAP) reagents and a single morpholine-forming assembly
   reaction. Combinations of just a few monomers enable the programmable
   construction of rotationally restricted, nonplanar heterocyclic arrays
   with discrete sizes and molecular shapes. The three-dimensional
   structures of these constrained scaffolds can be quickly and reliably
   predicted by DFT calculations and the target structures immediately
   decompiled into the constituent building blocks and assembly sequences.
   As a demonstration, in silico combinations of the building blocks
   predict saturated heptacyclic structures with elementary shapes
   including helices, S-turns and U-turns, which are synthesized in 5-6
   steps from the monomers using just three chemical reactions.},

Number = {3},
Pages = {99-107},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {We present a new approach for predicting program properties from large
   codebases (aka ``Big Code{''}). Our approach learns a probabilistic
   model from ``Big Code{''} and uses this model to predict properties of
   new, unseen programs.
   The key idea of our work is to transform the program into a
   representation that allows us to formulate the problem of inferring
   program properties as structured prediction in machine learning. This
   enables us to leverage powerful probabilistic models such as Conditional
   Random Fields (CRFs) and perform joint prediction of program properties.
   As an example of our approach, we built a scalable prediction engine
   called JSNICE for solving two kinds of tasks in the context of
   JavaScript: predicting (syntactic) names of identifiers and predicting
   (semantic) type annotations of variables. Experimentally, JSNICE
   predicts correct names for 63\% of name identifiers and its type
   annotation predictions are correct in 81\% of cases. Since its public
   release at http://jsnice.org, JSNice has become a popular system with
   hundreds of thousands of uses.
   By formulating the problem of inferring program properties as structured
   prediction, our work opens up the possibility for a range of new ``Big
   Code{''} applications such as de-obfuscators, decompilers, invariant
   generators, and others.},

Abstract = {Software defect prediction locates defective code to help developers
   improve the security of software. However, existing studies on software
   defect prediction are mostly limited to the source code. Defect
   prediction for Android binary executables (called apks) has never been
   explored in previous studies. In this paper, we propose an explorative
   study of defect prediction in Android apks. We first propose smali2vec,
   a new approach to generate features that capture the characteristics of
   smali (decompiled files of apks) files in apks. Smali2vec extracts both
   token and semantic features of the defective files in apks and such
   comprehensive features are needed for building accurate prediction
   models. Then we leverage deep neural network (DNN), which is one of the
   most common architecture of deep learning networks, to train and build
   the defect prediction model in order to achieve accuracy. We apply our
   defect prediction model to more than 90,000 smali files from 50 Android
   apks and the results show that our model could achieve an AUC (the area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 85.98\% and it is
   capable of predicting defects in apks. Furthermore, the DNN is proved to
   have a better performance than the traditional shallow machine learning
   algorithms (e.g., support vector machine and naive bayes) used in
   previous studies. The model has been used in our practical work and
   helped locate many defective files in apks.},

Title = {Using Ad-Related Network Behavior to Distinguish Ad Libraries},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Mobile app ads pose a far greater security threat to users than adverts
   on computer browsers. This is because app developers must embed a
   Software Development Kit (SDK), called an ad library or ad lib for
   short, provided by ad networks (i.e., ad companies) into their app
   program, and then merge and compile it into an Android PacKage (APK)
   execution file. The ad lib thus becomes a part of the entire app, and
   shares the whole permissions granted to the app. Unfortunately, this
   also resulted in many security issues, such as ad libs abusing the
   permissions to collect and leak private data, ad servers redirecting ad
   requests to download malicious JavaScript from unknown servers to
   execute it in the background of the mobile operating system without the
   user's consent. The more well-known an embedded ad lib, the safer the
   app may be, and vice versa. Importantly, while decompiling an APK to
   inspect its source code may not identify the ad lib(s), executing the
   app on a simulator can reveal the network behavior of the embedded ad
   lib(s). Ad libs exhibit different behavior patterns when communicating
   with ad servers. This study uses a dynamic analysis method to inspect an
   executing app, and plots the ad lib behavior patterns related to the
   advertisement into a graph. It is then determined whether or not the ad
   lib is from a trusted ad network using comparisons of graph
   similarities.},

Abstract = {Copying and pasting of source code is a common activity in software
   engineering. Often, the code is not copied as it is and it may be
   modified for various purposes; e.g. refactoring, bug fixing, or even
   software plagiarism. These code modifications could affect the
   performance of code similarity analysers including code clone and
   plagiarism detectors to some certain degree. We are interested in two
   types of code modification in this study: pervasive modifications, i.e.
   transformations that may have a global effect, and local modifications,
   i.e. code changes that are contained in a single method or code block.
   We evaluate 30 code similarity detection techniques and tools using five
   experimental scenarios for Java source code. These are (1) pervasively
   modified code, created with tools for source code and bytecode
   obfuscation, and boiler-plate code, (2) source code normalisation
   through compilation and decompilation using different decompilers, (3)
   reuse of optimal configurations over different data sets, (4) tool
   evaluation using ranked-based measures, and (5) local + global code
   modifications. Our experimental results show that in the presence of
   pervasive modifications, some of the general textual similarity measures
   can offer similar performance to specialised code similarity tools,
   whilst in the presence of boiler-plate code, highly specialised source
   code similarity detection techniques and tools outperform textual
   similarity measures. Our study strongly validates the use of
   compilation/decompilation as a normalisation technique. Its use reduced
   false classifications to zero for three of the tools. Moreover, we
   demonstrate that optimal configurations are very sensitive to a specific
   data set. After directly applying optimal configurations derived from
   one data set to another, the tools perform poorly on the new data set.
   The code similarity analysers are thoroughly evaluated not only based on
   several well-known pair-based and query-based error measures but also on
   each specific type of pervasive code modification. This broad, thorough
   study is the largest in existence and potentially an invaluable guide
   for future users of similarity detection in source code.},

Title = {The performance cost of software obfuscation for Android applications},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& SECURITY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {73},
Pages = {57-72},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Software security of Android applications is especially susceptible
   (vulnerable) to malicious reverse engineer than the native code based
   software, because its Java bytecode is easier to decompile and to
   reconstruct the original Java source code. Therefore obfuscation is an
   essential criterion for the protection of Android applications.
   Meanwhile, the unpredicted performance loss will be caused by the
   obfuscation, which might seriously influence the user experience of the
   software. Therefore the obfuscation degree and the performance cost out
   of it require being optimized. In this paper, we are working on the
   problem that: to obfuscate an Android application to a target level of
   ``difficulty{''} degree, while not substantially ``slowing it down{''}.
   We measure ``difficulty{''} by utilizing software complexity metrics and
   the ``slow{''} in CPU cycles. Within the framework designed for
   obfuscating Android applications, we implement the ``Naive Bayesian
   Classifier{''} algorithm for the optimized obfuscation of the software
   complexity and the performance, and show that it outperforms the
   algorithm whose predictions rely on mean values. We furthermore
   investigate the performance penalty imposed by obfuscation process when
   framework targets different complexity values and metrics. We show that
   some obfuscation methods are more performance costly than others to
   achieve the same metric value increase. Our result shows that, for any
   given software complexity, the required performance benefits can be
   achieved if the right obfuscation techniques are used. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {TinyDroid: A Lightweight and Efficient Model for Android Malware
   Detection and Classification},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {With the popularity of Android applications, Android malware has an
   exponential growth trend. In order to detect Android malware
   effectively, this paper proposes a novel lightweight static detection
   model, TinyDroid, using instruction simplification and machine learning
   technique. First, a symbol-based simplification method is proposed to
   abstract the opcode sequence decompiled from Android Dalvik Executable
   files. Then, N-gram is employed to extract features from the simplified
   opcode sequence, and a classifier is trained for the malware detection
   and classification tasks. To improve the efficiency and scalability of
   the proposed detection model, a compression procedure is also used to
   reduce features and select exemplars for the malware sample datasct.
   TinyDroid is compared against the state-of-the-art antivirus tools in
   real world using Drebin dataset. The experimental results show that
   TinyDroid can get a higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate with
   satisfied efficiency.},

Title = {Detecting Malware with an Ensemble Method Based on Deep Neural Network},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2018},
Abstract = {Malware detection plays a crucial role in computer security. Recent
   researches mainly use machine learning based methods heavily relying on
   domain knowledge for manually extracting malicious features. In this
   paper, we propose MalNet, a novel malware detection method that learns
   features automatically from the raw data. Concretely, we first generate
   a grayscale image from malware file, meanwhile extracting its opcode
   sequences with the decompilation tool IDA. Then MalNet uses CNN and LSTM
   networks to learn from grayscale image and opcode sequence,
   respectively, and takes a stacking ensemble for malware classification.
   We perform experiments on more than 40,000 samples including 20,650
   benign files collected from online software providers and 21,736
   malwares provided by Microsoft. The evaluation result shows that MalNet
   achieves 99.88\% validation accuracy for malware detection. In addition,
   we also take malware family classification experiment on 9 malware
   families to compare MalNet with other related works, in which MalNet
   outperforms most of related works with 99.36\% detection accuracy and
   achieves a considerable speed-up on detecting efficiency comparing with
   two state-of-the-art results on Microsoft malware dataset.},

Title = {LSTM-Based Hierarchical Denoising Network for Android Malware Detection},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2018},
Abstract = {Mobile security is an important issue on Android platform. Most malware
   detection methods based on machine learning models heavily rely on
   expert knowledge for manual feature engineering, which are still
   difficult to fully describe malwares. In this paper, we present
   LSTM-based hierarchical denoise network (HDN), a novel static Android
   malware detection method which uses LSTM to directly learn from the raw
   opcode sequences extracted from decompiled Android files. However, most
   opcode sequences are too long for LSTM to train due to the gradient
   vanishing problem. Hence, HDN uses a hierarchical structure, whose
   first-level LSTM parallelly computes on opcode subsequences (we called
   them method blocks) to learn the dense representations; then the
   second-level LSTM can learn and detect malware through method block
   sequences. Considering that malicious behavior only appears in partial
   sequence segments, HDN uses method block denoise module (MBDM) for data
   denoising by adaptive gradient scaling strategy based on loss cache. We
   evaluate and compare HDN with the latest mainstream researches on three
   datasets. The results show that HDN outperforms these Android malware
   detection methods, and it is able to capture longer sequence features
   and has better detection efficiency than N-gram-based malware detection
   which is similar to our method.},
