Abstract = {Owing to the development of next-generation network and data processing
   technologies, massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming
   hyperconnected. As a result, Linux malware is being created to attack
   such hyperconnected networks by exploiting security threats in IoT
   devices. To determine the potential threats of such Linux malware and
   respond effectively, malware classification through an analysis of the
   executed code is required; however, a limitation exists in that each
   heterogeneous architecture must be analyzed separately. However, the
   binary codes of a heterogeneous architecture can be translated to a
   high-level intermediate representation (IR) of the same format using
   binary lifting and malicious behavior information can be identified
   because the functions and parameters of the assembly code are stored in
   the IR. Consequently, this study suggests a Linux malware classification
   method applicable to various architectures by converting Linux assembly
   codes into an IR using binary lifting and then learning the IR Sequence
   which reflects malicious behavior pattern using deep learning model for
   sequence learning.},

   Entropy},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Binary function analysis is fundamental in understanding the behavior
   and genealogy of malware. The detection, classification, and analysis of
   Linux IoT malware and its variants present significant challenges due to
   the wide range of architectures supported by the Linux IoT platform.
   This study concentrates on static analysis using binary lifting
   techniques to extract and analyze Intermediate Representation (IR)
   opcode sequences. We introduce a set of statistical entropy-based
   features derived from these IR opcode sequences, establishing a
   practical and straightforward methodology for machine learning
   classification models. By exclusively analyzing function metadata and
   opcode entropy, our architecture-agnostic approach not only efficiently
   detects malware but also classifies its variants with a high degree of
   accuracy, achieving an F1 score of 97\%. The proposed approach offers a
   robust alternative for enhancing malware detection and variant
   identification frameworks for IoT devices.},

Title = {Work-Related Risk Assessment According to the Revised NIOSH Lifting
   Equation: A Preliminary Study Using a Wearable Inertial Sensor and
   Machine Learning},
Journal = {SENSORS},

Abstract = {Many activities may elicit a biomechanical overload. Among these,
   lifting loads can cause work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Aspiring
   to improve risk prevention, the National Institute for Occupational
   Safety and Health (NIOSH) established a methodology for assessing
   lifting actions by means of a quantitative method based on intensity,
   duration, frequency and other geometrical characteristics of lifting. In
   this paper, we explored the machine learning (ML) feasibility to
   classify biomechanical risk according to the revised NIOSH lifting
   equation. Acceleration and angular velocity signals were collected using
   a wearable sensor during lifting tasks performed by seven subjects and
   further segmented to extract time-domain features: root mean square,
   minimum, maximum and standard deviation. The features were fed to
   several ML algorithms. Interesting results were obtained in terms of
   evaluation metrics for a binary risk/no-risk classification;
   specifically, the tree-based algorithms reached accuracies greater than
   90\% and Area under the Receiver operating curve characteristics curves
   greater than 0.9. In conclusion, this study indicates the proposed
   combination of features and algorithms represents a valuable approach to
   automatically classify work activities in two NIOSH risk groups. These
   data confirm the potential of this methodology to assess the
   biomechanical risk to which subjects are exposed during their work
   activity.},

   Postures during Weight Lifting Tasks Using Inertial Sensors},

Abstract = {Occupational ergonomics aims to optimize the work environment and to
   enhance both productivity and worker well-being. Work-related exposure
   assessment, such as lifting loads, is a crucial aspect of this
   discipline, as it involves the evaluation of physical stressors and
   their impact on workers' health and safety, in order to prevent the
   development of musculoskeletal pathologies. In this study, we explore
   the feasibility of machine learning (ML) algorithms, fed with time- and
   frequency-domain features extracted from inertial signals (linear
   acceleration and angular velocity), to automatically and accurately
   discriminate safe and unsafe postures during weight lifting tasks. The
   signals were acquired by means of one inertial measurement unit (IMU)
   placed on the sternums of 15 subjects, and subsequently segmented to
   extract several time- and frequency-domain features. A supervised
   dataset, including the extracted features, was used to feed several ML
   models and to assess their prediction power. Interesting results in
   terms of evaluation metrics for a binary safe/unsafe posture
   classification were obtained with the logistic regression algorithm,
   which outperformed the others, with accuracy and area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve values of up to 96\% and 99\%,
   respectively. This result indicates the feasibility of the proposed
   methodology-based on a single inertial sensor and artificial
   intelligence-to discriminate safe/unsafe postures associated with load
   lifting activities. Future investigation in a wider study population and
   using additional lifting scenarios could confirm the potentiality of the
   proposed methodology, supporting its applicability in the occupational
   ergonomics field.},

   testing Using Machine Learning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Fibre ropes have been shown to be a viable alternative to steel wire
   rope for offshore lifting operations. Visual inspection remains a common
   method of fibre rope condition monitoring and has the potential to be
   further automated by machine learning. This would provide a valuable aid
   to current inspection frameworks to make more accurate decisions on
   recertification or retirement of fibre ropes in operational use. Three
   different machine learning algorithms: decision tree, random forest and
   support vector machine are compared to classical statistical approaches
   such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbours and Naive-Bayes for
   condition classification for fibre ropes under cyclic-bend-over-sheave
   (CBOS) testing. By measuring the rope global elongation throughout the
   CBOS tests, a binary classification system has been used to label
   recorded samples as healthy or close to rupture. Predictions are made on
   one rope through leave-one-out cross validation. The models are then
   assessed through calculating the accuracy, probability of detection,
   probability of false alarm and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient, and
   ranked based on the results. The results show that both machine learning
   and classical statistical methods are effective options for condition
   classification of fibre ropes under CBOS regimes. Typical values for
   Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) were shown to exceed 0.8 for the
   best performing methods.},

   Machine Learning},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY PROPULSION AND POWER},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {10},

Month = {NOV 3},
Abstract = {Turbulent flow separation over lifting surfaces impacts high-lift
   systems such as aircraft, wind turbines, and turbomachinery, and
   contributes to noise, lift loss, and vibrations. Accurate detection of
   flow separation is therefore essential to enable active control
   strategies and to mitigate its adverse effects. Several machine learning
   models are compared for detecting flow separation from surface pressure
   fluctuations. The models were trained on experimental data covering
   various airfoils, angles of attack (0 degrees-23 degrees), and Reynolds
   numbers, with Rec=0.8-4.5x106. For supervised learning, the ground-truth
   binary labels (attached or separated flow) were derived from static
   pressure distributions, lift coefficients, and the power spectral
   densities of surface pressure fluctuations. Three machine learning
   techniques (multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, logistic
   regression) were utilized with fine-tuned hyperparameters. Promising
   results are obtained, with the support vector machine achieving the
   highest performance (accuracy 0.985, Matthews correlation coefficient
   0.975), comparable to other models, with advantages in runtime and model
   size. However, most misclassifications occur near separation onset due
   to gradual transition, suggesting areas for model refinement.
   Sensitivity to database parameters is discussed alongside flow physics
   and data quality.},

Title = {An Effective Semi-fragile Watermarking Method for Image Authentication
   Based on Lifting Wavelet Transform and Feed-Forward Neural Network},

Abstract = {Digital watermarking is a significant issue in the field of information
   security and avoiding the misuse of images in the world of Internet and
   communication. This paper proposes a novel watermarking method for
   tamper detection and recovery using semi-fragile data hiding, based on
   lifting wavelet transform (LWT) and feed-forward neural network (FNN).
   In this work, first, the host image is decomposed up to one level using
   LWT, and the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is applied to each 2x2
   blocks of diagonal details. Next, a random binary sequence is embedded
   in each block as the watermark by correlating DC coefficients. In the
   authentication stage, first, the geometry is analyzed by using speeded
   up robust features (SURF) algorithm and extract watermark bits by using
   FNN. Afterward, logical exclusive or operation between original and
   extracted watermark is applied to detect tampered region. Eventually, in
   the recovery stage, tampered regions are recovered using the inverse
   halftoning technique. The performance and efficiency of the method and
   its robustness against various geometric, non-geometric, and hybrid
   attacks are reported. From the experimental results, it can be seen that
   the proposed method is superior in terms of robustness and quality of
   the watermarked and recovered images, respectively, compared to the
   state-of-the-art methods. Besides, imperceptibility has been improved by
   using different correlation steps as the gain factor for flat (smooth)
   and texture (rough) blocks. Based on the advantages exhibited, the
   proposed method outperforms the related works, in terms of superiority,
   efficiency, and effectiveness for tamper detection and recovery-based
   applications.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a robust image watermarking technique has been proposed
   in lifting wavelet transform (LWT) domain. Neural network is
   incorporated in the watermark extraction process to achieve improved
   robustness against different attacks. The integration of neural network
   with LWT makes the system robust to various attacks maintaining an
   adequate level of imperceptibility. The 3-level LWT coefficients are
   randomized and arranged in 2x2 non-overlapping blocks. Each block is
   modified according to a binary watermark bit. Randomization of
   coefficients and blocks has been done to enhance the security of the
   system. The binary watermark bit is also encrypted using another key.
   The scheme provides an average imperceptibility of 43.88 dB for a
   watermark capacity of 512 bits. The robustness has been observed against
   all the intentional and non-intentional attacks. The technique provides
   satisfactory robustness against different attacks such as noising
   attacks, de-noising attacks, lossy compression attacks, image processing
   attacks and some geometric attacks. The algorithm has been tested on a
   large image database containing different class of images.},

Abstract = {In recent years, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) practices have
   been applied in various industries to design, simulate and verify
   complex systems. The verification and validation (V\&V) of such systems
   engineering models are crucial to develop high-quality systems. However,
   this is a challenging problem due to the complexity of the models and
   semantic differences in how different tools interpret the models, which
   can undermine the validity of the obtained results if they go
   undiscovered. To address these issues, we propose (i) a subset of the
   SysML language for which the practical semantic integrity of tools can
   be achieved and (ii) a cloud-based V\&V framework for this subset,
   lifting verification to an industrial scale. We demonstrate the
   feasibility of our approach on an industrial-scale model from the
   aerospace domain and summarize the lessons learned during transitioning
   formal verification tools to an industrial context.},

Abstract = {This paper developed and evaluated the Precast Concrete Installation
   Dataset (PCI-Dataset), a large-scale video dataset for automatically

   classes combining three component types and four work stages. Evaluation
   of six Transformer-based video classification models showed VideoMAE V2
   achieved the highest overall accuracy of 98.10 \%, followed by UniFormer
   V2, Video Swin, MVIT, ViViT, and TimeSformer. VideoMAE V2 achieved F1
   scores above 80 \% for most activities, with a peak of 92.20 \% for slab

Abstract = {Photonic circuits attract much attention as promising candidates to
   overcome the drawbacks of their electronic counterparts. By utilizing
   the broad bandwidth and low energy consumption of optical communication,
   hybrid circuits can provide a comprehensive platform for the era beyond
   Moore's law. In particular, parallel matrix operations, the heavy
   lifting behind neural networks, remain challenging for traditional
   electronics due to high heat dissipation. To enable these parallel
   computations optically, (de-)multiplexing is crucial to address the
   different channels. Previously this has been accomplished with complex
   spectral or time encodings in wave division or time division methods.
   However, herein, a simple method to address parallel optical channels
   exclusively with 2-bit signals is presented. By using PEDOT:PSS as
   electrochromic material for intensity modulation, light transmission or
   absorption is controlled by oxidation and reduction with an electrolyte.
   Y-branch structures are used to design the multiplexing layout and to
   assign the 2-bit states to the channels. This binary addressable optical
   multiplexer, therefore, combines optical communication with electronic
   signals into a hybrid circuit.},

Abstract = {Small nuclear reactors can be applied to micro grid power generation,
   island and space nuclear power systems. The plate-type fuel assembly has
   a compact design structure, low fuel core temperature, large heat
   exchange area, and high heat exchange efficiency, which is widely used
   in small nuclear reactors. To supplement the lack of research in S-CO2
   small nuclear reactor, The Brayton cycle reactor system analysis program
   of S-CO2 plate-type fuel assemblies (BRESA-PFA) is developed, and the
   reactor control system program is developed to simulate the transient
   condition in this paper. This article establishes a fuel assembly flow
   and heat transfer model and a control rod control model using Modelica
   language, achieving physical and thermal coupling and power control of
   the reactor. The steady-state operating parameters of the developed
   program BRESA-PFA were studied, and the flow distribution, coolant and
   fuel temperature distribution of BRESA-PFA were obtained. The flow
   distribution conforms to the experimental parameters of CARR, and the
   fuel assembly radial temperature distribution is high at the center and
   low at the edge. After verification, the maximum fuel temperature did
   not exceed the limit value and met the design requirements. Transient
   characteristic analysis was conducted to study the rod lifting strategy
   during the startup process, the start-up and rod lifting process of
   BRESA-PFA is N2-N1-G2-G1, using the logic of step control. Research on
   reactor control system response under loss of coolant accident, after
   the accident, the coolant flow suddenly decreased to 65 \% of the rated
   value, and the reactor power also decreased to 65 \% FP, G2 and G1
   control rods were inserted downwards, the coolant temperature fluctuates
   by 1 \%similar to 2\%. The reactor control system was able to respond
   quickly, ensuring the stability of coolant temperature, proving the
   safety and reliability of BRESA-PFA, and providing theoretical reference
   and scheme support for the research of S-CO2 small nuclear reactors.},

Abstract = {Due to the advantages such as high efficiency, high precision, and the
   ability to reduce welding distortion, the block assembly method in
   shipbuilding possesses currently holds a dominant position in
   shipbuilding engineering. However, some key issues including low
   adjustment precision and slow control response speed urgently need to be
   resolved for the block assembly adjustment technology. This paper
   committed to solving the problems of inaccurate tracking of target
   displacement and slow control response speed in the vertical motion axis
   of the ship block joining equipment. A docking equipment control method
   based on the RBF neural network coupled with adaptive sliding mode
   algorithm was proposed. Firstly, an overview of the overall mechanics
   and control architecture of the ship block joining equipment was
   provided. Subsequently, a mathematical model for the transmission at the
   lifting mechanism was established. A sliding mode controller based on
   position control for the ship block joining equipment was designed for
   the transmission system. Then, the RBF neural network was employed to
   adjust the switching gain of the sliding mode controller and develop a
   self-adaptive sliding mode controller. Finally, simulations and
   verifications were conducted for multiple sets of input trajectories
   with different types. The results demonstrated that the combination of
   the neural network algorithm and the sliding mode control algorithm
   model presented in this paper reduces the system response time by
   28.125\% and improves the average motion tracking accuracy by 30.76\%.},

Abstract = {The computational fabrication pipeline for 3D printing is much like a
   compiler - users design models in Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools that
   are lowered to polygon meshes to be ultimately compiled to machine code
   by 3D slicers. For traditional compilers and programming languages,
   techniques for checking program invariants are well-established.
   Similarly, methods like differential testing are frequently used to
   uncover bugs in compilers themselves, which makes them more reliable.
   The fabrication pipeline would benefit from similar techniques but
   traditional approaches do not directly apply to the representations used
   in this domain. Unlike traditional programs, 3D models exist both as
   geometric objects (a CAD model or a polygon mesh) as well as machine
   code that ultimately runs on the hardware. The machine code, like in
   traditional compiling, is affected by many factors like the model, the
   slicer being used, and numerous user-configurable parameters that
   control the slicing process. In this work, we propose a new algorithm
   for lifting G-code (a common language used in many fabrication
   pipelines) by denoting a G-code program to a set of cuboids, and then
   defining an approximate point cloud representation for efficiently
   operating on these cuboids. Our algorithm opens up new opportunities: we
   show three use cases that demonstrate how it enables (1) error
   localization in CAD models through invariant checking, (2) quantitative
   comparisons between slicers, and (3) evaluating the efficacy of mesh
   repair tools. We present a prototype implementation of our algorithm in
   a tool, GLITCHFINDER, and evaluate it on 58 real-world CAD models. Our
   results show that GLITCHFINDER is particularly effective in identifying
   slicing issues due to small features, can highlight differences in how
   popular slicers (Cura and PrusaSlicer) slice the same model, and can
   identify cases where mesh repair tools (MeshLab and Meshmixer) introduce
   new errors during repair.},

   in modular construction assembly lookahead planning},
Journal = {ADVANCED ENGINEERING INFORMATICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {68},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Preparing constraint-free lookahead schedules (LAS) in the assembly
   stage of dynamic modular construction (MC) projects requires checking
   space availability for mobile crane operation using heterogeneous,
   distributed information sources. Current automated crane space
   evaluation methods rely on centralized information databases, whereas
   linked data based approaches are limited by insufficient geometric
   computation capabilities. This study proposes a framework to model and
   validate the space constraints for mobile crane operations using the
   semantic web. It starts with developing an ontology to represent crane
   lifting space requirements on the semantic web. Information sources,
   including construction site point clouds, 4D building information
   models, and crane specifications, are semantically interconnected using
   linked data. Shapes Constraint Language JavaScript Extension performs
   constraint validation through JavaScript-based mathematical computations
   utilizing the Separating Axis Theorem and a triangulation-based approach
   to check space for crane placement and rotation, respectively.
   Validation on two MC sites demonstrated the framework's effectiveness in
   identifying space constraint violations.},

Title = {Interpretable machine learning models for classifying low back pain
   status using functional physiological variables},
Journal = {EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {29},
Number = {8},
Pages = {1845-1859},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the predictive performance of statistical models
   which distinguishes different low back pain (LBP) sub-types and healthy
   controls, using as input predictors the time-varying signals of
   electromyographic and kinematic variables, collected during low-load
   lifting.
   Methods Motion capture with electromyography (EMG) assessment was
   performed on 49 participants {[}healthy control (con) = 16, remission
   LBP (rmLBP) = 16, current LBP (LBP) = 17], whilst performing a low-load
   lifting task, to extract a total of 40 predictors (kinematic and
   electromyographic variables). Three statistical models were developed
   using functional data boosting (FDboost), for binary classification of
   LBP statuses (model 1: con vs. LBP; model 2: con vs. rmLBP; model 3:
   rmLBP vs. LBP). After removing collinear predictors (i.e. a correlation
   of > 0.7 with other predictors) and inclusion of the covariate sex, 31
   predictors were included for fitting model 1, 31 predictors for model 2,
   and 32 predictors for model 3.
   Results Seven EMG predictors were selected in model 1 (area under the
   receiver operator curve {[}AUC] of 90.4\%), nine predictors in model 2
   (AUC of 91.2\%), and seven predictors in model 3 (AUC of 96.7\%). The
   most influential predictor was the biceps femoris muscle (peak beta =
   0.047) in model 1, the deltoid muscle (peak beta = 0.052) in model 2,
   and the iliocostalis muscle (peak beta = 0.16) in model 3.
   Conclusion The ability to transform time-varying physiological
   differences into clinical differences could be used in future
   prospective prognostic research to identify the dominant movement
   impairments that drive the increased risk.},

Title = {Directed grey box fuzzy testing for power terminal device firmware with
   intermediate representation similarity comparison},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {90},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The proliferation of heterogeneous devices in power IoT terminals
   significantly increases security risks due to firmware vulnerabilities,
   thereby threatening the stability and reliability of power systems.
   However, existing Directed Greybox Fuzzing (DGF) methods face
   challenges, such as the need for manual identification of vulnerable
   code and limitations to specific architectures. This paper proposes a
   DGF approach, guided by intermediate representation similarity
   comparison, comprising two main components: objective function
   localization and directed greybox fuzzing. In the objective function
   localization phase, support for multiple architectures is achieved by
   lifting the binary code to LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR). Given
   that functions may vary in both structure and semantics, we represent
   functions using both structural and semantic features. We employ word
   embedding techniques based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
   graph neural network models to construct feature vectors. By calculating
   the feature similarity between each function and known vulnerable
   functions, we automatically identify highly similar functions as
   targets. In the directed greybox fuzzing phase, to address issues like
   high false positive rates and unreachable targets, we designed a target
   scheduling mechanism. This mechanism permanently blocks targets that
   have been sufficiently covered and periodically blocks those that have
   not been covered, thereby further improving the efficiency of fuzzing.
   Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
   this method in identifying vulnerabilities in power terminal equipment.},

Title = {Headland Identification and Ranging Method for Autonomous Agricultural
   Machines},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Headland boundary identification and ranging are the key supporting
   technologies for the automatic driving of intelligent agricultural
   machinery, and they are also the basis for controlling operational
   behaviors such as autonomous turning and machine lifting. The complex,
   unstructured environments of farmland headlands render traditional image
   feature extraction methods less accurate and adaptable. This study
   utilizes deep learning and binocular vision technologies to develop a
   headland boundary identification and ranging system built upon the
   existing automatic guided tractor test platform. A headland image
   annotation dataset was constructed, and the MobileNetV3 network, notable
   for its compact model structure, was employed to achieve binary
   classification recognition of farmland and headland images. An improved
   MV3-DeeplabV3+ image segmentation network model, leveraging an attention
   mechanism, was constructed, achieving a high mean intersection over
   union (MIoU) value of 92.08\% and enabling fast and accurate detection
   of headland boundaries. Following the detection of headland boundaries,
   binocular stereo vision technology was employed to measure the boundary
   distances. Field experiment results indicate that the system's average
   relative errors of distance in ranging at distances of 25 m, 20 m, and
   15 m are 6.72\%, 4.80\%, and 4.35\%, respectively. This system is
   capable of meeting the real-time detection requirements for headland
   boundaries.},

Title = {An overview of testing methods for aeroengine fan noise},
Journal = {PROGRESS IN AEROSPACE SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {We are now at a point where airframes, aeroengines and their integration
   require radical changes to meet increasingly aggressive environmental
   targets. Generally, fan noise emitted from rotor-stator assemblies would
   be one of the dominant noise sources for modern and next-generation
   aircraft engines, which shall direct most research interest into fans in
   the coming decade and, therefore, the associated measurement constitutes
   the main focus of the current review. Amongst various approaches, an
   experimental study of fan noise is usually efficient and of
   high-fidelity, but the associated cost is expensive. Moreover, the
   design of a test would be time-consuming due to the adequate choice of
   testing methods with the adaption to the testing case and rig. In
   addition, in most cases the experimental setup requires some sort of
   optimization to achieve high measurement accuracy. This article provides
   a contemporary review of the most well-known and state-of-the-art
   testing methods with the focus on fan noise problems. More specifically,
   the acoustic mode detection and noise source reconstruction methods are
   most relevant to the understanding of noise generation mechanism and
   propagating characteristics, which are useful for further noise
   reduction studies, and therefore are extensively reviewed in this
   article. As timely guidance to potential interested readers, this paper
   also provides an overview of recent developments based on the
   compressive sensing and machine learning techniques that have enabled
   disruptive innovations by fundamentally changing the testing practices
   of conventional measurement methods, thus constituting the continued
   research direction for next-generation aeroengines.},

Title = {Co-evolutionary distance predictions contain flexibility information},
Journal = {BIOINFORMATICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},
Number = {1},
Pages = {65-72},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Motivation: Co-evolution analysis can be used to accurately predict
   residue-residue contacts from multiple sequence alignments. The
   introduction of machine-learning techniques has enabled substantial
   improvements in precision and a shift from predicting binary contacts to
   predict distances between pairs of residues. These developments have
   significantly improved the accuracy of de novo prediction of static
   protein structures. With AlphaFold2 lifting the accuracy of some
   predicted protein models close to experimental levels, structure
   prediction research will move on to other challenges. One of those areas
   is the prediction of more than one conformation of a protein. Here, we
   examine the potential of residue-residue distance predictions to be
   informative of protein flexibility rather than simply static structure.
   Results: We used DMPfold to predict distance distributions for every
   residue pair in a set of proteins that showed both rigid and flexible
   behaviour. Residue pairs that were in contact in at least one reference
   structure were classified as rigid, flexible or neither. The predicted
   distance distribution of each residue pair was analysed for local maxima
   of probability indicating the most likely distance or distances between
   a pair of residues. We found that rigid residue pairs tended to have
   only a single local maximum in their predicted distance distributions
   while flexible residue pairs more often had multiple local maxima. These
   results suggest that the shape of predicted distance distributions
   contains information on the rigidity or flexibility of a protein and its
   constituent residues.

Title = {Plane invariant segmentation of computed tomography images through
   weighted cross entropy optimized conditional GANs in compressed formats},
Journal = {MEDICAL \& BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING \& COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 10},
Abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) scan provides first-hand knowledge to doctors
   to identify an ailment. Deep neural networks help enhance image
   understanding through segmentation and labeling. In this work, we
   implement two variants of Pix2Pix generative adversarial networks (GANs)
   with varying complexities of generator and discriminator networks for
   plane invariant segmentation of CT scan images and subsequently propose
   an effective generative adversarial network with a suitably weighted
   binary cross-entropy loss function followed by image processing layer
   necessary for getting high-quality output segmentation. Our conditional
   GAN is powered by a unique set of an encoder-decoder network that
   coupled with the image processing layer produces enhanced segmentation.
   The network can be extended to the complete set of Hounsfield units and
   can also be implemented on smartphones. Furthermore, we also demonstrate
   effects on accuracy, F-1 score, and Jaccard index by using the
   conditional GAN networks on the spine vertebrae dataset, thus achieving
   an average of 86.28 \% accuracy, 90.5 \% Jaccard index score, and 89.9
   \% F-1 score in predicting segmented maps for validation input images.
   In addition, an overall lifting of accuracy, F-1 score, and Jaccard
   index graph for validation images with better continuity has also been
   highlighted.},

Title = {Overflow-Detectable Floating-Point Fully Homomorphic Encryption},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {6160-6180},
Abstract = {A floating-point fully homomorphic encryption (FPFHE) is proposed, which
   is based on torus fully homomorphic encryption equipped with
   programmable bootstrapping. Specifically, FPFHE for 32-bit and 64-bit
   floating-point messages are implemented, the latter showing the
   state-of-the-art precision among FHEs. Also, a ciphertext is constructed
   for checking if an overflow has occurred or not while evaluating
   arithmetic circuits with the proposed FPFHE, which is useful when the
   message space or arithmetic circuit is too complex to estimate a bound
   of outputs such as some deep learning applications. Also, homomorphic
   algorithms, which are crucial components of overflow detectable
   (OD)-FPFHE, are constructed. First, a state-of-the-art bootstrapping
   method of TFHE is extended to bootstrap larger messages by using
   NTT-friendly integer modulus. Second, a subgaussian analysis method is
   proposed without assuming independent heuristic on AP/GINX-bootstrapping
   even if the deterministic gadget decomposition is used. Third, the blind
   rotation algorithm of TFHE is modified such that any secret key having
   finite non-zero values can be used while keeping the number of NTT
   operations the same as when the binary key is used. Fourth, various
   homomorphic algorithms are proposed such as evaluating min and max,
   lifting a constant message to the monomial exponent, counting the number
   of consecutive zeros from the most significant in the fraction, and
   performing carryover after homomorphic operation of floating-point
   numbers. Finally, 32-bit and 64-bit OD-FPFHEs are implemented and
   simulation results are provided to confirm that they work well even for
   extreme cases. Also, it is verified that homomorphic overflow detection
   is well-operated.},

Title = {Fault identification using a chain of decision trees in an electrical
   submersible pump operating in a liquid-gas flow},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {184},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The monitoring of centrifugal pumps is essential for the suitable
   operation of several industrial applications. The reliability of
   petroleum artificial lifting systems that use Electrical Submersible
   Pumps (ESP) depends substantially on the performance of these pumps. ESP
   can operate subjected to severe operating conditions such as viscous and
   two-phase flow. In recent years, real-time technologies based on machine
   learning algorithms have gained importance due to the capability to take
   advantage of historical data for future predictions. The present work
   proposes a particular assembly of Classification and Regression Trees
   (CART) for the detection and classification of incipient faults in a
   pumping system. Experiments were carried out on a ten-stage ESP to
   simulate, monitor and label the faults. The pump worked at 1800, 2400,
   3000 and 3500 rpm, with a two-phase liquid-gas mixture. The gas-phase
   was nitrogen, and the liquid-phase was a heavy oil with a viscosity
   between 200 and 1000 cP. The proposed methodology, named here as Chain
   of Decision Trees, observe the system behavior based on the monitoring
   of the pressure, flow, torque, and temperature only. The algorithm has
   two steps. The first determines whether the system is in a fault state;
   if it is, the second determines the type of fault. The failures
   considered were the unexpected closure of the choke valve, the input
   pressure decreasing, the fluid viscosity increasing and the gas flow
   rate increasing. The proposed approach intends to improve the balance in
   classification and the interpretation of the cause of failure. The Chain
   of Decision Trees and the Decision Tree were compared regarding the
   overall accuracy and the individual fault misclassification getting a
   reduction in individual misclassification and better comprehensibility
   for the Chain of Decision Tree.},

Title = {Robust Classification of Intramuscular EMG Signals to Aid the Diagnosis
   of Neuromuscular Disorders},
Journal = {IEEE OPEN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {1},
Pages = {235-242},
Abstract = {Goal: This article presents the design and validation of an accurate
   automatic diagnostic system to classify intramuscular EMG (iEMG) signals
   into healthy, myopathy, or neuropathy categories to aid the diagnosis of
   neuromuscular diseases. Methods: First, an iEMG signal is decimated to
   produce a set of ``disjoint{''} downsampled signals, which are
   decomposed by the lifting wavelet transform (LWT). The Higuchi's fractal
   dimensions (FDs) of LWT coefficients in the subbands are computed. The
   FDs of LWT subband coefficients are fused with one-dimensional local
   binary pattern derived from each downsampled signal. Next, a multilayer
   perceptron neural network (MLPNN) determines the class labels of
   downsampled signals. Finally, the sequence of class labels is fed to the
   Boyer-Moore majority vote (BMMV) algorithm, which assigns a class to
   every iEMG signal. Results: The MLPNN-BMMV classifier was experimented
   with 250 iEMG signals belonging to three categories. The performance of
   the classifier was validated in comparison with state-of-the-art
   approaches. The MLPNN-BMMV has resulted in impressive performance
   measures (\%) using a 10-fold cross-validation-accuracy = 99.87 +/-
   0.25, sensitivity (normal) = 99.97 +/- 0.13, sensitivity (myopathy) =
   99.68 +/- 0.95, sensitivity (neuropathy) = 99.76 +/- 0.66, specificity
   (normal) = 99.72 +/- 0.61, specificity (myopathy) = 99.98 +/- 0.10, and
   specificity (neuropathy) = 99.96 +/- 0.14-surpassing the existing
   approaches. Conclusions: A future research direction is to validate the
   classifier performance with diverse iEMG datasets, which would lead to
   the design of an affordable real-time expert system for neuromuscular
   disorder diagnosis.},

Title = {Object-Aware Impedance Control for Human-Robot Collaborative Task With
   Online Object Parameter Estimation},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {22},
Pages = {8081-8094},
Abstract = {Physical human-robot interactions (pHRIs) can improve robot autonomy and
   reduce physical demands on humans. In this paper, we consider a
   collaborative task with a considerably long object and no prior
   knowledge of the object's parameters. An integrated control framework
   with an online object parameter estimator and a Cartesian object-aware
   impedance controller is proposed to realize complicated scenarios.
   During the transportation task, the object parameters are estimated
   online while a robot and human keep lifting an object. The perturbation
   motion is incorporated into the null space of the desired trajectory to
   enhance the estimator precision. An object-aware impedance controller is
   designed by incorporating the real-time estimation results to
   effectively transmit the intended human motion to the robot through the
   object. Experimental demonstrations of collaborative tasks, including
   object transportation and assembly, are implemented to show the
   effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed controller was also
   compared to a conventional impedance controller through subjective
   testing and found to be more sensitive, requiring less human effort.
   Note to Practitioners-This research was motivated by the need to
   facilitate collaboration between humans and robots in handling heavy or
   considerable long objects, which can be challenging for a single
   operator. This paper proposes a physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI)
   approach that enables physical interaction between the human and the
   robot through the object without additional sensors such as camera or
   human-machine interfaces. To achieve collaborative task, the separation
   between the intended human motion and the object dynamics is essential.
   Most of real-world situations involve uncertain or unknown objects,
   making it challenging to assume prior knowledge of the target object's
   properties. Therefore, this research introduces a real-time approach for
   estimating the dynamic parameters of unknown objects during
   collaboration, without requiring additional operational time.
   Consequently, the design of object-aware impedance controller can be
   achieved by real-time incorporation of object dynamics. Collaborative
   transportation and assembly task is demonstrated with whole-body
   controlled mobile manipulator and 1.5m long object. In future research,
   we will focus on enhancing the estimation precision through the use of
   physical informed neural network methods.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe diagnosis of sarcopenia relies extensively on human and
   equipment resources and requires individuals to personally visit medical
   institutions. The objective of this study was to develop a test-free,
   self-assessable approach to identify sarcopenia by utilizing artificial
   intelligence techniques and representative real-world data.MethodsThis
   multicentre study enrolled 11 661 middle-aged and older adults from a
   national survey initialized in 2011. Follow-up data from the baseline
   cohort collected in 2013 (n = 9403) and 2015 (n = 10 356) were used for
   validation. Sarcopenia was retrospectively diagnosed using the Asian
   Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 framework. Baseline age, sex, height,
   weight and 20 functional capacity (FC)-related binary indices
   (activities of daily living = 6, instrumental activities of daily living
   = 5 and other FC indices = 9) were considered as predictors. Multiple
   machine learning (ML) models were trained and cross-validated using 70\%
   of the baseline data to predict sarcopenia. The remaining 30\% of the
   baseline data, along with two follow-up datasets (n = 9403 and n = 10
   356, respectively), were used to assess model performance.ResultsThe
   study included 5634 men and 6027 women (median age = 57.0 years).
   Sarcopenia was identified in 1288 (11.0\%) individuals. Among the 20 FC
   indices, the running/jogging 1 km item showed the highest predictive
   value for sarcopenia (AUC {[}95\%CI] = 0.633 {[}0.620-0.647]). From the
   various ML models assessed, a 24-variable gradient boosting classifier
   (GBC) model was selected. This GBC model demonstrated favourable
   performance in predicting sarcopenia in the holdout data (AUC {[}95\%CI]
   = 0.831 {[}0.808-0.853], accuracy = 0.889, recall = 0.441, precision =
   0.475, F1 score = 0.458, Kappa = 0.396 and Matthews correlation
   coefficient = 0.396). Further model validation on the temporal scale
   using two longitudinal datasets also demonstrated good performance (AUC
   {[}95\%CI]: 0.833 {[}0.818-0.848] and 0.852 {[}0.840-0.865],
   respectively). The model's built-in feature importance ranking and the
   SHapley Additive exPlanations method revealed that lifting 5 kg and
   running/jogging 1 km were relatively important variables among the 20 FC
   items contributing to the model's predictive capacity, respectively. The
   calibration curve of the model indicated good agreement between
   predictions and actual observations (Hosmer and Lemeshow p = 0.501,
   0.451 and 0.374 for the three test sets, respectively), and decision
   curve analysis supported its clinical usefulness. The model was
   implemented as an online web application and exported as a deployable
   binary file, allowing for flexible, individualized risk
   assessment.ConclusionsWe developed an artificial intelligence model that
   can assist in the identification of sarcopenia, particularly in settings
   lacking the necessary resources for a comprehensive diagnosis. These
   findings offer potential for improving decision-making and facilitating
   the development of novel management strategies of sarcopenia.},

Abstract = {Background: The rapid increase in the number of patients with chronic
   diseases and depression, as well as the rapid spread of their effects,
   have led to these two health problems gradually developing into major
   public health issues in China and around the world. Currently, many
   individuals with chronic diseases are experiencing depressive symptoms
   one after another. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct research on
   how to prevent depression in this growing population of individuals with
   chronic diseases in a timely manner. Methods: Based on the data of the
   2015 and 2018 national follow-up surveys of the China Health and
   Retirement Longitudinal Study, a total of 7641 patients with short-term
   increase in the number of chronic diseases were selected as the study
   objects, and a binary logistic regression model was constructed
   according to the five dimensions of the health ecology model. The neural
   network model was used to explore the main (first two) factors affecting
   the increase in the number of chronic diseases in China in the short
   term, and the random forest and extreme value gradient lifting algorithm
   were used to verify them, and effective suggestions were put forward.
   Results: The detection rate of depression in the population with
   increasing number of chronic diseases from 2015 to 2018 was 42.13 \%.
   The model was established based on five dimensions of the health ecology
   model: Model 1 (Personal trait layer), Model 2 (Personal trait layer
   plus Behavioral feature layer), Model 3 (Personal trait layer plus
   Behavioral feature layer plus Living and working conditions layer),
   Model 4 (Personal trait layer plus Behavioral feature layer plus Living
   and working conditions layer plus Networking layer) and Model 5
   (Personal trait layer plus Behavioral feature layer plus Living and
   working conditions layer plus Networking layer plus Policy environment
   layer).The prediction accuracy of the five models was 66.4 \%, 68.3 \%,
   70.7 \%, 71.6 \% and 71.6 \%, respectively, and Model 5 showed that the
   P values of gender, self-rated health, night's sleep time (h),
   disability, life satisfaction, child satisfaction, place of residence
   and highest level of education were all <0.05, life satisfaction and
   self-rated health importance were 0.249 (100 \%) and 0.226 (90.8 \%).
   Conclusion: Gender, self-rated health, night sleep duration, disability,
   satisfaction with life, satisfaction with children, place of residence
   and highest level of education were the main influencing factors for the
   increase of depressive symptoms in the population with chronic diseases
   in the short term, among which life satisfaction and self-rated health
   have the greatest impact on depressive symptoms, and there is an
   interaction between the two.},
