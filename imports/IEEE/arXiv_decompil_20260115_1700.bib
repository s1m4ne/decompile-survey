	abstract = {Much software, whether beneficent or malevolent, is distributed only as binaries, sans source code. Absent source code, understanding binaries' behavior can be quite challenging, especially when compiled under higher levels of compiler optimization. These optimizations can transform comprehensible, "natural" source constructions into something entirely unrecognizable. Reverse engineering binaries, especially those suspected of being malevolent or guilty of intellectual property theft, are important and time-consuming tasks. There is a great deal of interest in tools to "decompile" binaries back into more natural source code to aid reverse engineering.Decompilationinvolves several desirable steps, including recreating source-language constructions, variable names, and perhaps even comments. One central step in creating binaries is optimizing function calls, using steps such as inlining. Recovering these (possibly inlined) function calls from optimized binaries is an essential task that most state-of-the-artdecompilertools try to do but do not perform very well. In this paper, we evaluate a supervised learning approach to the problem of recovering optimized function calls. We leverage open-source software and develop an automated labeling scheme to generate a reasonably large dataset of binaries labeled with actual function usages. We augment this large but limited labeled dataset with a pre-training step, which learns thedecompiledcode statistics from a much larger unlabeled dataset. Thus augmented, our learned labeling model can be combined with an existingdecompilationtool, Ghidra, to achieve substantially improved performance in function call recovery, especially at higher levels of optimization.},

	abstract = {Reverse engineering binaries is required to understand and analyse programs for which the source code is unavailable.Decompilerscan transform the largely unreadable binaries into a more readable source code-like representation. However, reverse engineering is time-consuming, much of which is taken up by labelling the functions with semantic information. While the automated summarisation ofdecompiledcode can help Reverse Engineers understand and analyse binaries, current work mainly focuses on summarising source code, and no suitable dataset exists for this task. In this work, we extend large pre-trained language models of source code to summarisedecompiledbinary functions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of input and data properties on the performance of such models. Our approach consists of two main components; the data and the model. We first build CAPYBARA, a dataset of 214Kdecompiledfunction-documentation pairs across various compiler optimisations. We extend CAPYBARA further by generating synthetic datasets and deduplicating the data. Next, we fine-tune the CodeT5 base model with CAPYBARA to create BinT5. BinT5 achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU-4 score of 60.83, 58.82, and 44.21 for summarising source,decompiled, and synthetically strippeddecompiledcode, respectively. This indicates that these models can be extended todecompiledbinaries successfully. Finally, we found that the performance of BinT5 is not heavily dependent on the dataset size and compiler optimisation level. We recommend future research to further investigate transferring knowledge when working with less expressive input formats such as stripped binaries.},

	abstract = {The software compilation process has a tendency to obscure the original design of the system and makes it difficult both to identify individual components and discern their purpose simply by examining the resulting binary code. Althoughdecompilationtechniques attempt to recover higher-level source code from the machine code in question, they are not fully able to restore the semantics of the original functions. Furthermore, binaries are often stripped of metadata, and this makes it challenging to reverse engineer complex binary software. In this paper we show how a combination of binary decomposition techniques,decompilationpasses, and LLM-powered function summarization can be used to build an economical engine to identify modules in stripped binaries and associate them with high-level natural language descriptions. We instantiated this technique with three underlying open-source LLMs – CodeQwen, DeepSeek-Coder and CodeStral – and measured its effectiveness in identifying modules in robotics firmware. This experimental evaluation involved 467 modules from four devices from the ArduPilot software suite, and showed that CodeStral, the best-performing backend LLM, achieves an average F1-score of 0.68 with an online running time of just a handful of seconds.},

However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. However, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect. This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language modelDecompilerbased on a sequence-to-sequence transformer trained over real-world code. We develop a novel tokenizer and exploit no-dropout training to produce high-quality code. We utilize type-inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code. We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 functions from ExeBench on two ISAs and at two optimizations levels. SLaDe is up to 6 times more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strengthdecompilerand up to 4 times more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both.},

	abstract = {Cryptographic libraries are a main target of timing side-channel attacks. A practical means to protect against these attacks is to adhere to the constant-time (CT) policy. However, it is hard to write constant-time code, and even constant-time code can be turned vulnerable by mainstream compilers. So how can we verify that binary code is constant-time? The obvious answer is to use binary-level CT tools. To do so, a common approach is to usedecompilersor lifters as a front-end for CT analysis tools operating on source code or IR. Unfortunately, this approach is problematic with currentdecompilers. To illustrate this fact, we use the recent Clangover vulnerability and other constructed examples to show that five populardecompilerseliminate CT violations, rendering them not applicable with the approach. In this paper, we develop foundations to asses whether adecompileris fit for theDecompile-then-Analyze approach. We propose CT transparency, which states that a transformation neither eliminates nor introduces CT violations, and a general method for proving that a program transformation is CT transparent. Then, we build CT-RetDec, a CT analysis tool based on a modified version of the LLVM-baseddecompilerRetDec. We evaluate CT-RetDec on a benchmark of real-world vulnerabilities in binaries, and show that the modifications had significant impact on CT-RetDec's performance. As a contribution of independent interest, we found that popular tools for binary-level CT analysis rely ondecompiler-like transformations before analysis. We show that two such tools employ transformations that are not CT transparent, and, consequently, that they incorrectly accept non-CT programs. While our examples are very specific and do not invalidate the general approach of these tools, we advocate that tool developers counter such potential issues by proving the transparency of such transformations.},

	abstract = {Decompilationis the procedure of transforming binary programs into a high-level representation, such as source code, for human analysts to examine. While moderndecompilerscan reconstruct and recover much information that is discarded during compilation, inferring variable names is still extremely difficult. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing, we propose a novel solution to infer variable names indecompiledcode based on Masked Language Modeling, Byte-Pair Encoding, and neural architectures such as Transformers and BERT. Our solution takes \textit{raw}decompileroutput, the less semantically meaningful code, as input, and enriches it using our proposed \textit{finetuning} technique, Constrained Masked Language Modeling. Using Constrained Masked Language Modeling introduces the challenge of predicting the number of masked tokens for the original variable name. We address this \textit{count of token prediction} challenge with our post-processing algorithm. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our trained VarBERT model is simpler and of much better performance. We evaluated our model on an existing large-scale data set with 164,632 binaries and showed that it can predict variable names identical to the ones present in the original source code up to 84.15\% of the time.},

	abstract = {Smart contracts deployed on blockchain platforms are vulnerable to various security vulnerabilities. However, only a small number of Ethereum contracts have released their source code, so vulnerability detection at the bytecode level is crucial. This paper introduces SmartBugBert, a novel approach that combines BERT-based deep learning with control flow graph (CFG) analysis to detect vulnerabilities directly from bytecode. Our method firstdecompilessmart contract bytecode into optimized opcode sequences, extracts semantic features using TF-IDF, constructs control flow graphs to capture execution logic, and isolates vulnerable CFG fragments for targeted analysis. By integrating both semantic and structural information through a fine-tuned BERT model and LightGBM classifier, our approach effectively identifies four critical vulnerability types: transaction-ordering, access control, self-destruct, and timestamp dependency vulnerabilities. Experimental evaluation on 6,157 Ethereum smart contracts demonstrates that SmartBugBert achieves 90.62\% precision, 91.76\% recall, and 91.19\% F1-score, significantly outperforming existing detection methods. Ablation studies confirm that the combination of semantic features with CFG information substantially enhances detection performance. Furthermore, our approach maintains efficient detection speed (0.14 seconds per contract), making it practical for large-scale vulnerability assessment.},

	abstract = {There exists a dichotomy between classical probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian networks (BNs), and modern tractable models, such as sum-product networks (SPNs). The former generally have intractable inference, but provide a high level of interpretability, while the latter admits a wide range of tractable inference routines, but are typically harder to interpret. Due to this dichotomy, tools to convert between BNs and SPNs are desirable. While one direction – compiling BNs into SPNs – is well discussed in Darwiche's seminal work on arithmetic circuit compilation, the converse direction –decompilingSPNs into BNs – has received surprisingly little attention. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing SPN2BN, an algorithm thatdecompilesan SPN into a BN. SPN2BN has several salient features when compared to the only other two worksdecompilingSPNs. Most significantly, the BNs returned by SPN2BN are minimal independence-maps that are more parsimonious with respect to the introduction of latent variables. Secondly, the output BN produced by SPN2BN can be precisely characterized with respect to a compiled BN. More specifically, a certain set of directed edges will be added to the input BN, giving what we will call the moral-closure. Lastly, it is established that our compilation-decompilationprocess is idempotent. This has practical significance as it limits the size of thedecompiledSPN.},

It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neuraldecompilersby borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate thedecompilationprocess as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to developdecompilationtools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-baseddecompilersdo not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized,decompilersthat do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP candecompileoptimized binaries with 45.21\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neuraldecompilationframeworks.},

Although multicore architectures are ubiquitous, the state-of-the-art translation tools do not handle concurrency primitives correctly. Doing so is rather challenging because of the subtle differences in the concurrency models between architectures. In response, we address various aspects of the challenge. First, we develop correct and efficient translations between the concurrency models of two mainstream architecture families: x86 and ARM (versions 7 and 8). We develop direct mappings between x86 and ARMv8 and ARMv7, and fence elimination algorithms to eliminate redundant fences after direct mapping. Although our mapping utilizes ARMv8 as an intermediate model for mapping between x86 and ARMv7, we argue that it should not be used as an intermediate model in adecompilerbecause it disallows common compiler transformations. Second, we propose and implement a technique for inserting memory fences for safely migrating programs between different architectures. Our technique checks robustness against x86 and ARM, and inserts fences upon robustness violations. Our experiments demonstrate that in most of the programs both our techniques introduce significantly fewer fences compared to naive schemes for porting applications across these architectures.},

While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of adecompilerto reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existingdecompilersfor Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AIDecompiler(MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application thatdecompilessmart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code with prompt engineering. Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 73.33\% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance, suggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs continue to advance. In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditionaldecompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, improving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart contracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3 projects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD. MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education.

To address this, we propose VulCatch, a binary-level vulnerability detection framework. VulCatch introduces a SynergyDecompilationModule (SDM) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to transform raw binary code into pseudocode using CodeT5, preserving high-level semantics for deep analysis with tools like Ghidra and IDA. KAN further enhances feature transformation, enabling the detection of complex vulnerabilities. VulCatch employs word2vec, Inception Blocks, BiLSTM Attention, and Residual connections to achieve high detection accuracy (98.88\%) and precision (97.92\%), while minimizing false positives (1.56\%) and false negatives (2.71\%) across seven CVE datasets.},

Commercial malware detection software can be costly, and tools that attribute malware to the specific software vulnerabilities it exploits are largely lacking. Understanding the connection between malware and the vulnerabilities it targets is crucial for analyzing past threats and proactively defending against current ones. In this study, we propose an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware, specifically within JAR files, and utilizes the capabilities of LLMs combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept tool called MalCVE, which integrates binary codedecompilation, deobfuscation, LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and CVE classification using LLMs. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of 3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware detection accuracy of 97\%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. It is also the first tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65\%, which is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code.},

	abstract = {The widespread lack of broad source code verification on blockchain explorers such as Etherscan, where despite 78,047,845 smart contracts deployed on Ethereum (as of May 26, 2025), a mere 767,520 ({\textless} 1\%) are open source, presents a severe impediment to blockchain security. This opacity necessitates the automated semantic analysis of on-chain smart contract bytecode, a fundamental research challenge with direct implications for identifying vulnerabilities and understanding malicious behavior. Prevailingdecompilersstruggle to reverse bytecode in a readable manner, often yielding convoluted code that critically hampers vulnerability analysis and thwarts efforts to dissect contract functionalities for security auditing. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a pioneeringdecompilationpipeline that, for the first time, successfully leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into human-readable and semantically faithful Solidity code. Our novel methodology first employs rigorous static program analysis to convert bytecode into a structured three-address code (TAC) representation. This intermediate representation then guides a Llama-3.2-3B model, specifically fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset of 238,446 TAC-to-Solidity function pairs, to generate high-quality Solidity. This approach uniquely recovers meaningful variable names, intricate control flow, and precise function signatures. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates a significant leap beyond traditionaldecompilers, achieving an average semantic similarity of 0.82 with original source and markedly superior readability. The practical viability and effectiveness of our research are demonstrated through its implementation in a publicly accessible system, available at https://evmdecompiler.com.},

Unfortunately, because compilation is lossy, deterministicdecompilersproduce code that is missing many of the details that make source code readable in the first place, like variable names and types. Neuraldecompilers, on the other hand, offer the ability to statistically fill in these details. Existing work in neuraldecompilation, however, suffers from substantial limitations that preclude its use on real code, such as the inability to define composite types, which is essential to fully specify function semantics. In this work, we introduce a new dataset, Realtype, that includes substantially more complicated and realistic types than existing neuraldecompilationbenchmarks, and Idioms, a new neuraldecompilationapproach to finetune any LLM into a neuraldecompilercapable of generating the appropriate user-defined type definitions alongside thedecompiledcode. We show that our approach yields state-of-the-art results in neuraldecompilation.

Although various approaches for automatic analysis exist and are the subject of ongoing research, analysts often have to resort to manual static analysis to get a deep understanding of a given binary sample. Since the source code of encountered samples is rarely available, analysts regularly employdecompilersfor easier and faster comprehension than analyzing a binary's disassembly. In this paper, we introduce ourdecompilationapproach dewolf. We developed a variety of improvements over the previous academic state-of-the-artdecompilerand some novel algorithms to enhance readability and comprehension, focusing on manual analysis. To evaluate our approach and to obtain a better insight into the analysts' needs, we conducted three user surveys. The results indicate that dewolf is suitable for malware comprehension and that its output quality noticeably exceeds Ghidra and Hex-Rays in certain aspects. Furthermore, our results imply thatdecompilersaiming at manual analysis should be highly configurable to respect individual user preferences. Additionally, futuredecompilersshould not necessarily follow the unwritten rule to stick to the code-structure dictated by the assembly in order to produce readable output. In fact, the few cases where dewolf already cracks this rule lead to its results considerably exceeding otherdecompilers. We publish a prototype implementation of dewolf and all survey results on GitHub.},

While state-of-the-art class inheritance inference solutions are effective in dealing with unoptimized code, their efficacy is impeded by optimization. Particularly, constructor inlining–or worse exclusion–due to optimization render class inheritance recovery challenging. Further, while modern solutions such as MARX can successfully group classes within an inheritance sub-tree, they fail to establish directionality of inheritance, which is crucial for security-related applications (e.g.decompilation). We implemented a prototype of DeClassifier using Binary Analysis Platform (BAP) and evaluated DeClassifier against 16 binaries compiled using gcc under multiple optimization settings. We show that (1) DeClassifier can recover 94.5\% and 71.4\% true positive directed edges in the class hierarchy tree under O0 and O2 optimizations respectively, (2) a combination of ctor+dtor analysis provides much better inference than ctor only analysis.},

	abstract = {Complexities that arise from implementation of object-oriented concepts in C++ such as virtual dispatch and dynamic type casting have attracted the attention of attackers and defenders alike. Binary-level defenses are dependent on full and precise recovery of class inheritance tree of a given program. While current solutions focus on recovering single and multiple inheritances from the binary, they are oblivious to virtual inheritance. Conventional wisdom among binary-level defenses is that virtual inheritance is uncommon and/or support for single and multiple inheritances provides implicit support for virtual inheritance. In this paper, we show neither to be true. Specifically, (1) we present an efficient technique to detect virtual inheritance in C++ binaries and show through a study that virtual inheritance can be found in non-negligible number (more than 10\% on Linux and 12.5\% on Windows) of real-world C++ programs including Mysql and libstdc++. (2) we show that failure to handle virtual inheritance introduces both false positives and false negatives in the hierarchy tree. These false positves and negatives either introduce attack surface when the hierarchy recovered is used to enforce CFI policies, or make the hierarchy difficult to understand when it is needed for program understanding (e.g., duringdecompilation). (3) We present a solution to recover virtual inheritance from COTS binaries. We recover a maximum of 95\% and 95.5\% (GCC -O0) and a minimum of 77.5\% and 73.8\% (Clang -O2) of virtual and intermediate bases respectively in the virtual inheritance tree.},

On the one hand, malicious parties may recover interpretable source codes from the software products to gain commercial advantages. On the other hand, binarydecompilationcan be leveraged for code vulnerability analysis and malware detection. However, efficient binarydecompilationis challenging. Conventionaldecompilershave the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To address the above problems, we propose Coda, the first end-to-end neural-based framework for codedecompilation. Coda decomposes thedecompilationtask into two key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a tree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention feeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches. We assess Coda's performance with extensive experiments on various benchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82\% program recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-artdecompilersyield 0\% accuracy. Furthermore, Coda outperforms the sequence-to-sequence model with attention by a margin of 70\% program accuracy.},

	abstract = {Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference. We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2\% to 38.6\% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization acrossdecompilationlevels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.},

However, their effectiveness for Android malware analysis remains underexplored.DecompiledAndroid malware code presents unique challenges for analysis, due to the malicious logic being buried within a large number of functions and the frequent lack of meaningful function names. This paper presents CAMA, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis. CAMA specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics (consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance), enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use CAMA to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpretdecompiledcode and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis.},

Recently, researchers have proposed using techniques from neural machine translation to automate the process indecompilation. Although such techniques hold the promise of targeting a wider range of source and assembly languages, to date they have primarily targeted C code. In this paper we argue that existing neuraldecompilershave achieved higher accuracy at the cost of requiring language-specific domain knowledge such as tokenizers and parsers to build an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the source language, which increases the overhead of supporting new languages. We explore a different tradeoff that, to the extent possible, treats the assembly and source languages as plain text, and show that this allows us to build adecompilerthat is easily retargetable to new languages. We evaluate our prototypedecompiler, Beyond The C (BTC), on Go, Fortran, OCaml, and C, and examine the impact of parameters such as tokenization and training data selection on the quality ofdecompilation, finding that it achieves comparabledecompilationresults to prior work in neuraldecompilationwith significantly less domain knowledge. We will release our training data, traineddecompilationmodels, and code to help encourage future research into language-agnosticdecompilation.},

Although some progress has been made in generating human-readable information fromdecompiledbinary files with Large Language Models (LLMs), effectively and scalably detecting vulnerabilities within these binary files is still an open problem. This paper explores the novel application of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities within these binary files. We demonstrate the feasibility of identifying vulnerable programs through a combined approach ofdecompilationoptimization to make the vulnerabilities more prominent and long-term memory for a larger context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in binary vulnerability analysis. Our findings highlight the potential for LLMs to overcome the limitations of traditional analysis methods and advance the field of binary vulnerability detection, paving the way for more secure software systems. In this paper, we present Vul-BinLLM , an LLM-based framework for binary vulnerability detection that mirrors traditional binary analysis workflows with fine-grained optimizations indecompilationand vulnerability reasoning with an extended context. In thedecompilationphase, Vul-BinLLM adds vulnerability and weakness comments without altering the code structure or functionality, providing more contextual information for vulnerability reasoning later. Then for vulnerability reasoning, Vul-BinLLM combines in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting along with a memory management agent to enhance accuracy. Our evaluations encompass the commonly used synthetic dataset Juliet to evaluate the potential feasibility for analysis and vulnerability detection in C/C++ binaries. Our evaluations show that Vul-BinLLM is highly effective in detecting vulnerabilities on the compiled Juliet dataset.},

In this paper, we present an explorative empirical study evaluating the capabilities of six state-of-the-art LLMs: GPT-4, GPT-3, DeepSeek, Gemma 2, Llama 3, and Code Llama, in understanding IRs. Specifically, we assess model performance across four core tasks: control flow graph reconstruction,decompilation, code summarization, and execution reasoning. While LLMs exhibit competence in parsing IR syntax and identifying high-level structures, they consistently struggle with instruction-level reasoning, especially in control flow reasoning, loop handling, and dynamic execution. Common failure modes include misinterpreting branching instructions, omitting critical operations, and relying on heuristic reasoning rather than precise instruction-level logic. Our findings highlight the need for IR-specific enhancements in LLM design.

Large language models (LLMs) although have brought impressive improvement to source code tasks, do not directly generalize to assembly code due to the unique challenges of assembly: (1) the low information density of assembly and (2) the diverse optimizations in assembly code. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code.

The problem ofdecompilationis extremely important for security researchers. Finding vulnerabilities and understanding how malware operates is much easier when done over source code. The importance ofdecompilationhas motivated the construction of hand-crafted rule-baseddecompilers. Suchdecompilershave been designed by experts to detect specific control-flow structures and idioms in low-level code and lift them to source level. The cost of supporting additional languages or new language features in these models is very high. We present a novel approach todecompilationbased on neural machine translation. The main idea is to automatically learn adecompilerfrom a given compiler. Given a compiler from a source language S to a target language T , our approach automatically trains adecompilerthat can translate (decompile) T back to S . We used our framework todecompileboth LLVM IR and x86 assembly to C code with high success rates. Using our LLVM and x86 instantiations, we were able to successfullydecompileover 97\% and 88\% of our benchmarks respectively.},

	abstract = {Control flow obfuscation (CFO) alters the control flow path of a program without altering its semantics. Existing literature has proposed several techniques; however, a quick survey reveals a lack of clarity in the types of techniques proposed, and how many are unique. What is also unclear is whether there is a disparity in the theory and practice of CFO. In this paper, we systematically study CFO techniques proposed for Java programs, both from papers and commercially available tools. We evaluate 13 obfuscators using a dataset of 16 programs with varying software characteristics, and different obfuscator parameters. Each program is carefully reverse engineered to study the effect of obfuscation. Our study reveals that there are 36 unique techniques proposed in the literature and 7 from tools. Three of the most popular commercial obfuscators implement only 13 of the 36 techniques in the literature. Thus there appears to be a gap between the theory and practice of CFO. We propose a novel classification of the obfuscation techniques based on the underlying component of a program that is transformed. We identify the techniques that are potent against reverse engineering attacks, both from the perspective of a human analyst and an automated programdecompiler. Our analysis reveals that majority of the tools do not implement these techniques, thus defeating the protection obfuscation offers. We furnish examples of select techniques and discuss our findings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to assemble such a research. This study will be useful to software designers to decide upon the best techniques to use based upon their needs, for researchers to understand the state-of-the-art and for commercial obfuscator developers to develop new techniques.},

Chief among the techniques employed is a new variant of static analysis context: shrinking context sensitivity. Shrinking context sensitivity performs deep cuts in the static analysis context, eagerly "forgetting" control-flow history, in order to leave room for further precise reasoning. We compare Shrnkr to state-of-the-artdecompilers, both static-analysis- and symbolic-execution-based.

In recent years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such asdecompilationand compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation.},

It has been widely used when analysts perform security analysis on software (systems) whose source code is unavailable, such as vulnerability search and malware analysis. However, currentdecompilationtools usually need lots of experts' efforts, even for years, to generate the rules fordecompilation, which also requires long-term maintenance as the syntax of high-level PL or low-level PL changes. Also, an idealdecompilershould concisely generate high-level PL with similar functionality to the source low-level PL and semantic information (e.g., meaningful variable names), just like human-written code. Unfortunately, existing manually-defined rule-baseddecompilationtechniques only functionally restore the low-level PL to a similar high-level PL and are still powerless to recover semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel neuraldecompilationapproach to translate low-level PL into accurate and user-friendly high-level PL, effectively improving its readability and understandability. Furthermore, we implement the proposed approaches called SEAM. Evaluations on four real-world applications show that SEAM has an average accuracy of 94.41\%, which is much better than prior neural machine translation (NMT) models.

These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new framework that enhancesdecompileroutput by combining static analysis (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically, {\textbackslash}system constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the quality of thedecompiledcode, compared to SOTAdecompilers(e.g., Gigahorse).

SMT solvers, which serve as a foundation for these tools, have thus increased support for bitvector reasoning through bit-blasting and linear arithmetic approximations. In this paper we show that similar linear arithmetic approximation of bitvector operations can be done at the source level through transformations. Specifically, we introduce new paths that over-approximate bitvector operations with linear conditions/constraints, increasing branching but allowing us to better exploit the well-developed integer reasoning and interpolation of verification tools. We show that, for reachability of bitvector programs, increased branching incurs negligible overhead yet, when combined with integer interpolation optimizations, enables more programs to be verified. We further show this exploitation of integer interpolation in the common case also enables competitive termination verification of bitvector programs and leads to the first effective technique for LTL verification of bitvector programs.

	abstract = {Due to their widespread use on heterogeneous hardware devices, deep learning (DL) models are compiled into executables by DL compilers to fully leverage low-level hardware primitives. This approach allows DL computations to be undertaken at low cost across a variety of computing platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and various hardware accelerators. We present BTD (Bin to DNN), adecompilerfor deep neural network (DNN) executables. BTD takes DNN executables and outputs full model specifications, including types of DNN operators, network topology, dimensions, and parameters that are (nearly) identical to those of the input models. BTD delivers a practical framework to process DNN executables compiled by different DL compilers and with full optimizations enabled on x86 platforms. It employs learning-based techniques to infer DNN operators, dynamic analysis to reveal network architectures, and symbolic execution to facilitate inferring dimensions and parameters of DNN operators. Our evaluation reveals that BTD enables accurate recovery of full specifications of complex DNNs with millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet). The recovered DNN specifications can be re-compiled into a new DNN executable exhibiting identical behavior to the input executable. We show that BTD can boost two representative attacks, adversarial example generation and knowledge stealing, against DNN executables. We also demonstrate cross-architecture legacy code reuse using BTD, and envision BTD being used for other critical downstream tasks like DNN security hardening and patching.},

	abstract = {Binarydecompilationplays a vital role in various cybersecurity and software engineering tasks. Recently, end-to-enddecompilationmethods powered by large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate highly readable source code with minimal human intervention. However, existing LLM-based approaches face several critical challenges, including limited capability in reconstructing code structure and logic, low accuracy in data recovery, concerns over data security and privacy, and high computational resource requirements. To address these issues, we develop the CodeInverter Suite, making three contributions: (1) the CodeInverter Workflow (CIW) is a novel prompt engineering workflow that incorporates control flow graphs (CFG) and explicit data mappings to improve LLM-baseddecompilation. (2) Using CIW on well-known source code datasets, we curate the CodeInverter Dataset (CID), a domain-specific dataset containing 8.69 million samples that contains CFGs and data mapping tables. (3) We train the CoderInverter Models (CIMs) on CID, generating two lightweight LLMs (with 1.3B and 6.7B parameters) intended for efficient inference in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the CIW substantially enhances the performance of various LLMs across multiple metrics. Our CIM-6.7B can achieve state-of-the-artdecompilationperformance, outperforming existing LLMs even with over 100x more parameters indecompilationtasks, an average improvement of 11.03\% in re-executability, 6.27\% in edit similarity.},

	abstract = {Security experts reverse engineer (decompile) binary code to identify critical security vulnerabilities. The limited access to source code in vital systems - such as firmware, drivers, and proprietary software used in Critical Infrastructures (CI) - makes this analysis even more crucial on the binary level. Even with available source code, a semantic gap persists after compilation between the source and the binary code executed by the processor. This gap may hinder the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. That being said, current research on Large Language Models (LLMs) overlooks the significance ofdecompiledbinaries in this area by focusing solely on source code. In this work, we are the first to empirically uncover the substantial semantic limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs when it comes to analyzing vulnerabilities indecompiledbinaries, largely due to the absence of relevant datasets. To bridge the gap, we introduce DeBinVul, a noveldecompiledbinary code vulnerability dataset. Our dataset is multi-architecture and multi-optimization, focusing on C/C++ due to their wide usage in CI and association with numerous vulnerabilities. Specifically, we curate 150,872 samples of vulnerable and non-vulnerabledecompiledbinary code for the task of (i) identifying; (ii) classifying; (iii) describing vulnerabilities; and (iv) recovering function names in the domain ofdecompiledbinaries. Subsequently, we fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using DeBinVul and report on a performance increase of 19\%, 24\%, and 21\% in the capabilities of CodeLlama, Llama3, and CodeGen2 respectively, in detecting binary code vulnerabilities. Additionally, using DeBinVul, we report a high performance of 80-90\% on the vulnerability classification task. Furthermore, we report improved performance in function name recovery and vulnerability description tasks.},

In this paper, we propose the first empirical study on the understandability of Javadecompiledcode and obtained the following findings: (1) Understandability of Javadecompilationis considered as important as its correctness, anddecompilationunderstandability issues are even more commonly encountered thandecompilationfailures. (2) A notable percentage of code snippetsdecompiledby Javadecompilersexhibit significantly lower or higher levels of understandability in comparison to their original source code.

This metric was extended from Cognitive Complexity, with six more rules harvested from an exhaustive manual analysis into 1287 pairs of source code snippets and correspondingdecompiledcode. This metric was also validated using the original and updated dataset, yielding an impressive macro F1-score of 0.88 on the original dataset, and 0.86 on the test set.},

Existing techniquesdecompiledata-oriented features in netlists, like loops and modules, but struggle with sequential logic. In particular, they cannotdecompilememory elements, which pose difficulty due to their deconstruction into individual bits and the feedback loops they form in the netlist. Recovering multi-bit registers and memory blocks from netlists would expand the applications of hardwaredecompilation, notably towards retargeting technologies (e.g. FPGAs to ASICs) anddecompilingprocessor memories. We devise a method for register aggregation, to identify relationships between the data flip-flops in a netlist and group them into registers and memory blocks, resulting in HDL code that instantiates these memory elements. We aggregate flip-flops by identifying common enable pins, and derive the bit-order of the resulting registers using functional dependencies. This scales similarly to memory blocks, where we repeat the algorithm in the second dimension with special attention to the read, write, and address ports of each memory block. We evaluate our technique over a dataset of 13 gate-level netlists, comprising circuits from binary multipliers to CPUs, and we compare the quantity and widths of recovered registers and memory blocks with the original source code. The technique successfully recovers memory elements in all of the tested circuits, even aggregating beyond the source code expectation. In 10 / 13 circuits, all source code memory elements are accounted for, and we are able to compact up to 2048 disjoint bits into a single memory block.},

Manual methods are time-consuming, require significant expertise, and do not scale to the rate at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. Automated methods are an attractive alternative, and we propose Partially RecompilableDecompilation(PRD). PRD lifts suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level techniques. Althoughdecompilationand recompilation do not typically work on an entire binary, our approach succeeds because it is limited to a few functions, like those identified by our binary fault localization. We evaluate these assumptions and find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, 70-89\% of individual functions are successfullydecompiledand recompiled with sufficient type recovery. In comparison, only 1.7\% of the full C-binaries succeed. Whendecompilationsucceeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 92.9\% of the time. In addition, we evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating only on binaries, performs as well as, and sometimes better than full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a success rate consistent with these same tools operating with access to the entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those produced by top CGC teams. For generality, our evaluation includes two independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world binaries.},

	abstract = {Binary analysis is a core component of many critical security tasks, including reverse engineering, malware analysis, and vulnerability detection. Manual analysis is often time-consuming, but identifying commonly-used or previously-seen functions can reduce the time it takes to understand a new file. However, given the complexity of assembly, and the NP-hard nature of determining function equivalence, this task is extremely difficult. Common approaches often use sophisticated disassembly anddecompilationtools, graph analysis, and other expensive pre-processing steps to perform function similarity searches over some corpus. In this work, we identify a number of discrepancies between the current research environment and the underlying application need. To remedy this, we build a new benchmark, REFuSE-Bench, for binary function similarity detection consisting of high-quality datasets and tests that better reflect real-world use cases. In doing so, we address issues like data duplication and accurate labeling, experiment with real malware, and perform the first serious evaluation of ML binary function similarity models on Windows data. Our benchmark reveals that a new, simple basline, one which looks at only the raw bytes of a function, and requires no disassembly or other pre-processing, is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple settings. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions that complex models with highly-engineered features are being used to their full potential, and demonstrate that simpler approaches can provide significant value.},

	abstract = {WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) has emerged as a cornerstone of web development, offering a compact binary format that allows high-performance applications to run at near-native speeds in web browsers. Despite its advantages, Wasm's binary nature presents significant challenges for developers and researchers, particularly regarding readability when debugging or analyzing web applications. Therefore, effectivedecompilationbecomes crucial. Unfortunately, traditionaldecompilersoften struggle with producing readable outputs. While some large language model (LLM)-baseddecompilershave shown good compatibility with general binary files, they still face specific challenges when dealing with Wasm. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, WaDec, which is the first use of a fine-tuned LLM to interpret anddecompileWasm binary code into a higher-level, more comprehensible source code representation. The LLM was meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of wat-c code snippets, employing self-supervised learning techniques. This enables WaDec to effectivelydecompilenot only complete wat functions but also finer-grained wat code snippets. Our experiments demonstrate that WaDec markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art tools, offering substantial improvements across several metrics. It achieves a code inflation rate of only 3.34\%, a dramatic 97\% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art's 116.94\%. Unlike baselines' output that cannot be directly compiled or executed, WaDec maintains a recompilability rate of 52.11\%, a re-execution rate of 43.55\%, and an output consistency of 27.15\%.

	abstract = {We classify .NET files as either benign or malicious by examining directed graphs derived from the set of functions comprising the given file. Each graph is viewed probabilistically as a Markov chain where each node represents a code block of the corresponding function, and by computing the PageRank vector (Perron vector with transport), a probability measure can be defined over the nodes of the given graph. Each graph is vectorized by computing Lebesgue antiderivatives of hand-engineered functions defined on the vertex set of the given graph against the PageRank measure. Files are subsequently vectorized by aggregating the set of vectors corresponding to the set of graphs resulting fromdecompilingthe given file. The result is a fast, intuitive, and easy-to-compute glass-box vectorization scheme, which can be leveraged for training a standalone classifier or to augment an existing feature space. We refer to this vectorization technique as PageRank Measure Integration Vectorization (PMIV). We demonstrate the efficacy of PMIV by training a vanilla random forest on 2.5 million samples ofdecompiled.NET, evenly split between benign and malicious, from our in-house corpus and compare this model to a baseline model which leverages a text-only feature space.

	abstract = {Manual translation of the algorithms from sequential version to its parallel counterpart is time consuming and can be done only with the specific knowledge of hardware accelerator architecture, parallel programming or programming environment. The automation of this process makes porting the code much easier and faster. The key aspect in this case is how efficient the generated parallel code will be. The paper describes J-Parallelio, the framework for automatic analysis of the bytecode source codes and its parallelisation on multicore processors. The process consists of a few steps. First step is a process ofdecompilationof JVM and its translation to internal abstract syntax tree, the dependency extraction and memory analysis is performed. Finally, the mapping process is performed which consists of a set of rules responsible for translating the input virtual machine source code to its parallel version. The main novelty is that it can deal with pure Java virtual machine and can generate parallel code for multicore processors. This makes the system portable and it can work with different languages based on JVM after some small modifications. The efficiency of automatically translated source codes were compared with their manually written counterparts on chosen benchmarks.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations (IR) to improve code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic information and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and produces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation (NMT) approaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one can get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as sequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between similar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages. The consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of NMT, and stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy. Here we propose to augment code translation with IRs, specifically LLVM IR, with results on the C++, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon the state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number of correct translations by 11\% on average, and up to 79\% for the Java -{\textgreater} Rust pair with greedy decoding. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of Go and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on the problem of IRdecompilation, generating programming source code from IR, and study using IRs as intermediary pivot for translation.},

To mitigate this, we introduce SK2Decompile, a novel two-phase approach todecompilefrom the skeleton (semantic structure) to the skin (identifier) of programs. Specifically, we first apply a Structure Recovery model to translate a program's binary code to an Intermediate Representation (IR) as deriving the program's "skeleton", i.e., preserving control flow and data structures while obfuscating all identifiers with generic placeholders. We also apply reinforcement learning to reward the model for producing program structures that adhere to the syntactic and semantic rules expected by compilers. Second, we apply an Identifier Naming model to produce meaningful identifiers which reflect actual program semantics as deriving the program's "skin". We train the Identifier Naming model with a separate reinforcement learning objective that rewards the semantic similarity between its predictions and the reference code. Such a two-phasedecompilationprocess facilitates advancing the correctness and readability ofdecompilationindependently. Our evaluations indicate that SK2Decompile, significantly outperforms the SOTA baselines, achieving 21.6\% average re-executability rate gain over GPT-5-mini on the HumanEval dataset and 29.4\% average R2I improvement over Idioms on the GitHub2025 benchmark.},

However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLMdecompilationtechnology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduceDecompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmarkDecompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues.

Based on this dataset, we then build and train a model, with the aim of recovering the RASP code from the compiled model. We demonstrate that the simple form of Tracr compiled transformer weights is interpretable for such adecompilermodel. In an empirical evaluation, our model achieves exact reproductions on more than 30\% of the test objects, while the remaining 70\% can generally be reproduced with only few errors. Additionally, more than 70\% of the programs, produced by our model, are functionally equivalent to the ground truth, and therefore a validdecompilationof the Tracr compiled transformer weights.},

	abstract = {Cybersecurity attacks on embedded devices for industrial control systems and cyber-physical systems may cause catastrophic physical damage as well as economic loss. This could be achieved by infecting device binaries with malware that modifies the physical characteristics of the system operation. Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional reverse engineering tools candecompilebinaries to low-level code, but offer little semantic insight. This paper proposes the REMaQE automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or pointers, and can reverse engineer object-oriented implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool "tmon". To evaluate REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations. Real-time execution enables integration in an interactive math-oriented reverse engineering workflow.},

In various such contexts, it is crucial that the result is trustworthy, i.e., it can be formally established that the pointer designations are overapproximative. This paper presents an approach to formally proven correct binary-level pointer analysis. A salient property of our approach is that it first generically considers what proof obligations a generic abstract domain for pointer analysis must satisfy. This allows easy instantiation of different domains, varying in precision, while preserving the correctness of the analysis. In the trade-off between scalability and precision, such customization allows "meaningful" precision (sufficiently precise to ensure basic sanity properties, such as that relevant parts of the stack frame are not overwritten during function execution) while also allowing coarse analysis when pointer computations have become too obfuscated during compilation for sound and accurate bounds analysis. We experiment with three different abstract domains with high, medium, and low precision. Evaluation shows that our approach is able to derive designations for memory writes soundly in COTS binaries, in a context-sensitive interprocedural fashion.},

This is framed as a program synthesis task, training a VLM todecompileraster images into programs composed of Bézier curves. Our model, acting as a "visualdecompiler", demonstrates performance superior to strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o. The most significant finding is that when trained solely on modern Chinese characters, the model is able to reconstruct ancient Oracle Bone Script in a zero-shot context.

	abstract = {With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has been paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various educational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on blockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by developers for its “event-triggered" mechanism for building education intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified, so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes aredecompiledto get the opcode. Secondly, the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG) are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the vulnerability detection of smart contracts. Compared with the traditional approaches, it can get good results with fewer layers of the GCN model, which shows that the contract bytecode and GCN model are efficient in vulnerability detection.},

These shortcomings arise from compiler optimizations and the loss of semantic cues in compiled code, which LLMs struggle to recover without contextual guidance. To address this challenge, we propose ICL4Decomp, a hybriddecompilationframework that leverages in-context learning (ICL) to guide LLMs toward generating re-executable source code. We evaluate our method across multiple datasets, optimization levels, and compilers, demonstrating around 40\% improvement in re-executability over state-of-the-artdecompilationmethods while maintaining robustness.},

	abstract = {Decompilationis widely used in reverse engineering to recover high-level language code from binary executables. While recent approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files. This limitation significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics from assembly code. To address this limitation, we propose {\textbackslash}saltm, a novel binarydecompilationmethod that abstracts stable logical features shared between binary and source code. The core idea of {\textbackslash}saltm is to abstract selected binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery. Given a binary function, {\textbackslash}saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree ({\textbackslash}salt) from assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language. It then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed {\textbackslash}salt to generatedecompiledcode. Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol recovery to improve readability and correctness. We compare {\textbackslash}saltm to three categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercialdecompilers, anddecompilationmethods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP, Exebench). Our experimental results demonstrate that {\textbackslash}saltm is highly effective in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\% TCP rate onDecompile-Eval with a 10.6\% improvement). The results further validate its robustness against four commonly used obfuscation techniques. Additionally, analyses of real-world software and a user study confirm that ourdecompiledoutput offers superior assistance to human analysts in comprehending binary functions.},

	abstract = {Ethereum smart contracts hold tens of billions of USD in DeFi and NFTs, yet comprehensive security analysis remains difficult due to unverified code, proxy-based architectures, and the reliance on manual inspection of complex execution traces. Existing approaches fall into two main categories: anomaly transaction detection, which flags suspicious transactions but offers limited insight into specific attack strategies hidden in execution traces inside transactions, and code vulnerability detection, which cannot analyze unverified contracts and struggles to show how identified flaws are exploited in real incidents. As a result, analysts must still manually align transaction traces with contract code to reconstruct attack scenarios and conduct forensics. To address this gap, TraceLLM is proposed as a framework that leverages LLMs to integrate execution trace-level detection withdecompiledcontract code. We introduce a new anomaly execution path identification algorithm and an LLM-refineddecompiletool to identify vulnerable functions and provide explicit attack paths to LLM. TraceLLM establishes the first benchmark for joint trace and contract code-driven security analysis. For comparison, proxy baselines are created by jointly transmitting the results of three representative code analysis along with raw traces to LLM. TraceLLM identifies attacker and victim addresses with 85.19\% precision and produces automated reports with 70.37\% factual precision across 27 cases with ground truth expert reports, achieving 25.93\% higher accuracy than the best baseline. Moreover, across 148 real-world Ethereum incidents, TraceLLM automatically generates reports with 66.22\% expert-verified accuracy, demonstrating strong generalizability.},

The recovered C source code, once re-compiled, is expected to produce an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. With over twenty years of development, Cdecompilershave been widely used in production to support reverse engineering applications. Despite the prosperous development of Cdecompilers, it is widely acknowledged thatdecompileroutputs are mainly used for human consumption, and are not suitable for automatic recompilation. Often, a substantial amount of manual effort is required to fix thedecompileroutputs before they can be recompiled and executed properly. This paper is motived by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in comprehending dense corpus of natural language. To alleviate the tedious, costly and often error-prone manual effort in fixingdecompileroutputs, we investigate the feasibility of using LLMs to augmentdecompileroutputs, thus delivering recompilabledecompilation. Note that different from previous efforts that focus on augmentingdecompileroutputs with higher readability (e.g., recovering type/variable names), we focus on augmentingdecompileroutputs with recompilability, meaning to generate code that can be recompiled into an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. We conduct a pilot study to characterize the obstacles in recompiling the outputs of the de facto commercial Cdecompiler– IDA-Pro. We then propose a two-step, hybrid approach to augmentingdecompileroutputs with LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a set of popular C test cases, and show that our approach can deliver a high recompilation success rate to over 75\% with moderate effort, whereas none of the IDA-Pro's original outputs can be recompiled. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations of our approach and promising future research directions.},

	abstract = {Demonstrating quantum advantage using conventional quantum algorithms remains challenging on current noisy gate-based quantum computers. Automated quantum circuit synthesis via quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution, employing trainable parametric quantum circuits to alleviate this. The circuit ansatz in these solutions is often designed through reinforcement learning-based quantum architecture search when the domain knowledge of the problem and hardware are not effective. However, the interpretability of these synthesized circuits remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their scalability and applicability across diverse problem domains. This work addresses the challenge of explainability in quantum architecture search (QAS) by introducing a novel genetic programming-baseddecompilerframework for reverse-engineering high-level quantum algorithms from low-level circuit representations. The proposed approach, implemented in the open-source tool DeQompile, employs program synthesis techniques, including symbolic regression and abstract syntax tree manipulation, to distill interpretable Qiskit algorithms from quantum assembly language. Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating thedecompilerwith online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms.},

	abstract = {Decompilationaims to recover the source code form of a binary executable. It has many security applications, such as malware analysis, vulnerability detection, and code hardening. A prominent challenge indecompilationis to recover variable names. We propose a novel technique that leverages the strengths of generative models while mitigating model biases. We build a prototype, GenNm, from pre-trained generative models CodeGemma-2B, CodeLlama-7B, and CodeLlama-34B. We finetune GenNm ondecompiledfunctions and teach models to leverage contextual information. GenNm includes names from callers and callees while querying a function, providing rich contextual information within the model's input token limitation. We mitigate model biases by aligning the output distribution of models with symbol preferences of developers. Our results show that GenNm improves the state-of-the-art name recovery precision by 5.6-11.4 percentage points on two commonly used datasets and improves the state-of-the-art by 32\% (from 17.3\% to 22.8\%) in the most challenging setup where ground-truth variable names are not seen in the training dataset.},

	abstract = {With the rapid advancement of Internet technology, the threat of malware to computer systems and network security has intensified. Malware affects individual privacy and security and poses risks to critical infrastructures of enterprises and nations. The increasing quantity and complexity of malware, along with its concealment and diversity, challenge traditional detection techniques. Static detection methods struggle against variants and packed malware, while dynamic methods face high costs and risks that limit their application. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel and efficient malware detection techniques to improve accuracy and robustness. This study first employs the minhash algorithm to convert binary files of malware into grayscale images, followed by the extraction of global and local texture features using GIST and LBP algorithms. Additionally, the study utilizes IDA Pro todecompileand extract opcode sequences, applying N-gram and tf-idf algorithms for feature vectorization. The fusion of these features enables the model to comprehensively capture the behavioral characteristics of malware. In terms of model construction, a CNN-BiLSTM fusion model is designed to simultaneously process image features and opcode sequences, enhancing classification performance. Experimental validation on multiple public datasets demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional detection techniques in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, particularly in detecting variants and obfuscated malware with greater stability. The research presented in this paper offers new insights into the development of malware detection technologies, validating the effectiveness of feature and model fusion, and holds promising application prospects.},

	abstract = {Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT) provides a sound and complete framework to reason about trace equivalence between simple imperative programs. However, there are still several notable limitations. First, GKAT is completely agnostic with respect to the meaning of primitives, to keep equivalence decidable. Second, GKAT excludes non-local control flow such as goto, break, and return. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Control-Flow GKAT (CF-GKAT), a system that allows reasoning about programs that include non-local control flow as well as hardcoded values. CF-GKAT is able to soundly and completely verify trace equivalence of a larger class of programs, while preserving the nearly-linear efficiency of GKAT. This makes CF-GKAT suitable for the verification of control-flow manipulating procedures, such asdecompilationand goto-elimination. To demonstrate CF-GKAT's abilities, we validated the output of several highly non-trivial program transformations, such as Erosa and Hendren's goto-elimination procedure and the output of Ghidradecompiler. CF-GKAT opens up the application of Kleene Algebra to a wider set of challenges, and provides an important verification tool that can be applied to the field ofdecompilationand control-flow transformation.},

	abstract = {Decompilationconverts machine code into human-readable form, enabling analysis and debugging without source code. However, fidelity issues often degrade the readability and semantic accuracy ofdecompiledoutput. Existing methods, such as variable renaming or structural simplification, provide partial improvements but lack robust detection and correction, particularly for complex closed-source binaries. We present FidelityGPT, a framework that enhancesdecompiledcode accuracy and readability by systematically detecting and correcting semantic distortions. FidelityGPT introduces distortion-aware prompt templates tailored to closed-source settings and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a dynamic semantic intensity algorithm to locate distorted lines and retrieve semantically similar code from a database. A variable dependency algorithm further mitigates long-context limitations by analyzing redundant variables and integrating their dependencies into the prompt context. Evaluated on 620 function pairs from a binary similarity benchmark, FidelityGPT achieved an average detection accuracy of 89\% and a precision of 83\%. Compared to the state-of-the-art DeGPT (Fix Rate 83\%, Corrected Fix Rate 37\%), FidelityGPT attained 94\% FR and 64\% CFR, demonstrating significant gains in accuracy and readability. These results highlight its potential to advance LLM-baseddecompilationand reverse engineering.},

	abstract = {As one of the key tools in many security tasks,decompilersreconstruct human-readable source code from binaries. Yet, despite recent advances, their outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and remain difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refinedecompileroutput. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanceddecompiler-LLM pipeline with a fine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality ofdecompiledcode: preserving accuracy while improving readability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality assessment system to score thedecompiledsource code from multiple aspects, and use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best output during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accuratedecompiledcode from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3\% more improveddecompiledfunctions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the quality of 68.2\% of all the functions produced by the nativedecompiler.},
