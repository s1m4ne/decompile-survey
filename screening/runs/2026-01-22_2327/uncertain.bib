 abstract = {Static binary analysis is a widely used approach for ensuring the security of closed-source software. However, the absence of type information in stripped binaries, particularly for composite data types, poses significant challenges for both static analyzers and reverse engineering experts in achieving efficient and accurate analysis. Existing methods often struggle with inaccuracies and scalability limitations when dealing with such data types. To address these problems, we present Typeforge, a novel approach inspired by the workflow of reverse engineering experts, which uses a two-stage synthesis-selection strategy to automate the recovery of composite data types from stripped binaries. We design a new graph structure, the Type Flow Graph (TFG) to represent type information within stripped binaries. In the first stage, TFG-based Type Synthesis focuses on efficiently and accurately building constraints and synthesizing possible composite type declarations from the stripped binaries. In the second stage, we propose an LLM-assisted double-elimination framework to select the best-fit type declaration from the candidates by assessing the readability of the decompiled code. Our comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrates that TYPEFORGE achieves F1 scores of 81.7\% and 88.2\% in Composite Data Type Identification and Layout Recovery, respectively, substantially outperforming existing methods. Additionally, TYPEFORGE achieves an F1 score of 72.1\% in Relationship Recovery, a particularly challenging task for previous approaches. Furthermore, TYPEFORGE has significantly lower time overhead, requiring only about 3.8\% of the time taken by OSPREY, the best-performing existing approach, making it a promising solution for various real-world reverse engineering tasks.},

 abstract = {Decompilation aims to recover the source code form of a binary executable. It has many security applications, such as malware analysis, vulnerability detection, and code hardening. A prominent challenge in decompilation is to recover variable names. We propose a novel technique that leverages the strengths of generative models while mitigating model biases. We build a prototype, GenNm, from pre-trained generative models CodeGemma-2B, CodeLlama-7B, and CodeLlama-34B. We finetune GenNm on decompiled functions and teach models to leverage contextual information. GenNm includes names from callers and callees while querying a function, providing rich contextual information within the model's input token limitation. We mitigate model biases by aligning the output distribution of models with symbol preferences of developers. Our results show that GenNm improves the state-of-the-art name recovery precision by 5.6-11.4 percentage points on two commonly used datasets and improves the state-of-the-art by 32\% (from 17.3\% to 22.8\%) in the most challenging setup where ground-truth variable names are not seen in the training dataset.},
