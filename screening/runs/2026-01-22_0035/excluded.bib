 abstract = {Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is one of the common neurological disorders caused by prolonged compression of the median nerve. Thus, CTS patients’ daily tasks are significantly affected. Traditional diagnostic methods are invasive or subjective, causing pain or inaccuracy. Therefore, a more accurate machine/deep learning classifier is needed to provide an accessible assessment approach that can help screen out early-stage patients to prevent further deterioration. Behavioral biomechanics has shown great potential to be used for CTS and its severity classification. The biomechanical parameters are collected when identified patients and healthy individuals perform daily life activities, such as grasping and lifting in a controlled manner. Facing the challenges of time series biomechanical data with small sample sizes and high dimensions, we propose a novel classification algorithm to create an ensemble model for CTS detection using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed algorithm achieves 93% accuracy on average for CTS detection using biomechanical data of daily life activities.},

 abstract = {Muscle fatigue onset detection and estimation have applications in supporting athletes during strength training. In this paper, the problem of surface electromyography (sEMG) based binary classification of fatigue and non-fatigue of human muscle activity during strength training is addressed. Further, the learned model is used to determine the fatigue onset using sEMG signals corresponding to a training activity. A novelty of this work is the analysis of the proposed machine learning method under different measurement conditions, such as varying postures, experience levels and lifting loads. A novel sEMG dataset titled ElectroMyography Analysis of Human Activities - DataBase 6 (EMAHA-DB6) is developed for strength training activities. EMAHA-DB6 includes sEMG signals collected from the seven prominent muscle sites of the right arm of 11 subjects engaged in strength training. The participants performed five distinct training exercises using three load weights in two body postures. A set of wavelet and time domain features are extracted and the support vector machines are used to classify them. Based on the binary testing results from a given time series, the fatigue onset is estimated using the majority voting. The SVM model is compared with other classifiers in terms of testing accuracy in the mentioned measurement scenarios. The SVM has outperformed the other models with a test accuracy of 86.5% under all conditions scenario. In terms of the impact of measurement conditions, the SVM has 94% in the low load condition, 88.5% in the stand posture and nearly 88% in the case of subjects with intermediate training status. Finally, in the proposed approach, the estimation of the fatigue onset has an average relative error of 12%.},

 abstract = {A floating-point fully homomorphic encryption (FPFHE) is proposed, which is based on torus fully homomorphic encryption equipped with programmable bootstrapping. Specifically, FPFHE for 32-bit and 64-bit floating-point messages are implemented, the latter showing the state-of-the-art precision among FHEs. Also, a ciphertext is constructed for checking if an overflow has occurred or not while evaluating arithmetic circuits with the proposed FPFHE, which is useful when the message space or arithmetic circuit is too complex to estimate a bound of outputs such as some deep learning applications. Also, homomorphic algorithms, which are crucial components of overflow detectable (OD)-FPFHE, are constructed. First, a state-of-the-art bootstrapping method of TFHE is extended to bootstrap larger messages by using NTT-friendly integer modulus. Second, a subgaussian analysis method is proposed without assuming independent heuristic on AP/GINX-bootstrapping even if the deterministic gadget decomposition is used. Third, the blind rotation algorithm of TFHE is modified such that any secret key having finite non-zero values can be used while keeping the number of NTT operations the same as when the binary key is used. Fourth, various homomorphic algorithms are proposed such as evaluating min and max, lifting a constant message to the monomial exponent, counting the number of consecutive zeros from the most significant in the fraction, and performing carryover after homomorphic operation of floating-point numbers. Finally, 32-bit and 64-bit OD-FPFHEs are implemented and simulation results are provided to confirm that they work well even for extreme cases. Also, it is verified that homomorphic overflow detection is well-operated.},

 abstract = {The weight lifting is defined as any activity requiring the use of human force to lift or move a load which can be potentially harmful of onsetting work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of four tree-based Machine Learning (ML) models - fed with time-domain features extracted from signals acquired by means of one inertial measurement unit (IMU) - to classify safe and unsafe postures during weight lifting. Inertial signals -linear acceleration and angular velocity - acquired from sternum of 4 healthy subjects were registered using the Mobility Lab System. The signals were manually segmented in order to extract for each region of interest, corresponding to the lifting, several time-domain features. Four tree-based predictive models - namely Decision Tree, Random Forest, Rotation Forest and AdaBoost Tree - were implemented and their performances were tested. Interesting results in terms of evaluation metrics for a binary safe/unsafe posture classification were obtained with accuracy values greater than 93%. In conclusion the present study indicated that tree-based ML models fed with specific features were able to discriminate safe and unsafe posture during weight lifting using only one IMU placed on the sternum. Future investigation on larger cohort could confirm the potential of the proposed methodology.},

 abstract = {While third-party libraries (TPLs) are extensively reused to enhance productivity during software development, they can also introduce potential security risks such as vulnerability propagation. Software composition analysis (SCA), proposed to identify reused TPLs for reducing such risks, has become an essential procedure within modern DevSecOps. As one of the mainstream SCA techniques, binary-to-source SCA identifies the third-party source projects contained in binary files via binary source code matching, which is a major challenge in reverse engineering since binary and source code exhibit substantial disparities after compilation. The existing binary-to-source SCA techniques leverage basic syntactic features that suffer from redundancy and lack robustness in the large-scale TPL dataset, leading to inevitable false positives and compromised recall. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce BinaryAI, a novel binary-to-source SCA technique with two-phase binary source code matching to capture both syntactic and semantic code features. First, BinaryAI trains a transformer-based model to produce function-level embeddings and obtain similar source functions for each binary function accordingly. Then by applying the link-time locality to facilitate function matching, BinaryAI detects the reused TPLs based on the ratio of matched source functions. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BinaryAI in terms of binary source code matching and the downstream SCA task. Specifically, our embedding model outperforms the state-of-the-art model CodeCMR, i.e., achieving 22.54% recall@l and 0.34 MRR compared with 10.75% and 0.17 respectively. Additionally, BinaryAI outperforms all existing binary-to-source SCA tools in TPL detection, increasing the precision from 73.36% to 85.84% and recall from 59.81% to 64.98% compared with the well-recognized commercial SCA product Black Duck.

 abstract = {Human activity has been closely related to the development of musculoskeletal disorders. Workers in industries such as manufacturing, assembly, and construction often engage in repetitive and various motions, such as lifting heavy objects or performing the same task for a long period. Because such activities can increase the risk of various muscular disorders, it is important to help workers choose the best postures when performing their activities. In this study, we propose a deep learning approach for task recognition and RULA score calculation. Our approach uses a revised version of the Long Term Recurrent Convolutional Neural network-based model to classify work activities based on video input and then applies a separate neural network to estimate the RULA score for each input activity. We trained and evaluated our approach using a dataset of annotated work activities. Our results show that our approach achieves competitive accuracy for activity recognition and RULA score estimation, demonstrating the potential of deep learning for improving ergonomic assessments in the workplace.},

 abstract = {Matching binary to source code and vice versa has various applications in different fields, such as computer security, software engineering, and reverse engineering. Even though there exist methods that try to match source code with binary code to accelerate the reverse engineering process, most of them are designed to focus on one programming language. However, in real life, programs are developed using different programming languages depending on their requirements. Thus, cross-language binary-to-source code matching has recently gained more attention. Nonetheless, the existing approaches still struggle to have precise predictions due to the inherent difficulties when the problem of matching binary code and source code needs to be addressed across programming languages. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-language binary source code matching. We propose GraphBinMatch, an approach based on a graph neural network that learns the similarity between binary and source codes. We evaluate GraphBinMatch on several tasks, such as cross-language binary-to-source code matching and cross-language source-to-source matching. We also evaluate the performance of our approach on single-language binary-to-source code matching. Experimental results show that GraphBinMatch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art, with improvements as high as 15% over the F1 score.},

 abstract = {Physical human-robot interactions (pHRIs) can improve robot autonomy and reduce physical demands on humans. In this paper, we consider a collaborative task with a considerably long object and no prior knowledge of the object’s parameters. An integrated control framework with an online object parameter estimator and a Cartesian object-aware impedance controller is proposed to realize complicated scenarios. During the transportation task, the object parameters are estimated online while a robot and human keep lifting an object. The perturbation motion is incorporated into the null space of the desired trajectory to enhance the estimator precision. An object-aware impedance controller is designed by incorporating the real-time estimation results to effectively transmit the intended human motion to the robot through the object. Experimental demonstrations of collaborative tasks, including object transportation and assembly, are implemented to show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The proposed controller was also compared to a conventional impedance controller through subjective testing and found to be more sensitive, requiring less human effort. Note to Practitioners—This research was motivated by the need to facilitate collaboration between humans and robots in handling heavy or considerable long objects, which can be challenging for a single operator. This paper proposes a physical Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) approach that enables physical interaction between the human and the robot through the object without additional sensors such as camera or human-machine interfaces. To achieve collaborative task, the separation between the intended human motion and the object dynamics is essential. Most of real-world situations involve uncertain or unknown objects, making it challenging to assume prior knowledge of the target object’s properties. Therefore, this research introduces a real-time approach for estimating the dynamic parameters of unknown objects during collaboration, without requiring additional operational time. Consequently, the design of object-aware impedance controller can be achieved by real-time incorporation of object dynamics. Collaborative transportation and assembly task is demonstrated with whole-body controlled mobile manipulator and 1.5m long object. In future research, we will focus on enhancing the estimation precision through the use of physical informed neural network methods.},

This system will provide continuous analysis of the predough parameters, such as temperature, humidity, lifting force and titranic acidity, which will ensure timely detection of deviations in the quality of the predough and avoid production problems. In addition, it will help automate the quality control process and ensure the stability of production processes. Analysis and forecasting of dough parameters will improve the quality of produced bread or other bakery products. Management based also on the predicted values of technological indicators of the predough will allow the enterprise to avoid unnecessary costs of materials and energy and increase economic efficiency. As part of the study, seven machine learning models were created and reviewed, including three linear and four varieties of binary decision trees. An analysis of the best model - a regression decision tree - was carried out, confirming its effectiveness and the validity of the resulting hierarchical structure, in particular, the prediction of important indicators of predough with a high degree of reliability, which indicates its importance in practical applications in production. The created model can be used to monitor and control product quality in real time, allowing operators to quickly identify and correct any deviations in process performance. Also, by analyzing changes in the variables of the predough production process, it is possible to identify precursors of possible production accidents or deviations in product quality, which will allow timely measures to be taken to avoid them.},

In addition to this pipeline, a neural network trained only on previous users classifies biceps and triceps activity to detect up or down gestures on a rolling basis; this enables finer control over the robot and expands the feasible workspace. The resulting system is evaluated by 10 untrained subjects performing a variety of team lifting and assembly tasks with rigid and flexible objects.},

The composition of the supernumerary robotic limbs includes two additional robot arms and an installation backplane that is easy for the wearer to wear. If SRL works closely with the user and acts more human-like, they can be seen as a part of human's body. Finally, humans will be able to expand existing operations and upgrade their skills, carry out tasks more effectively.

 abstract = {Due to the differences in the diagnostic characteristics and criteria of various methods, the conclusions are often inconsistent when using these methods to diagnose faults. when transformer faults occur, it is often a combination of multiple fault types, and the correspondence between fault types and fault symptoms is fuzzy. In order to describe the fuzzy correspondence in the complex fault diagnosis, the fuzzy mathematical theory is further introduced on the basis of the information fusion diagnosis method, and a comprehensive diagnosis method based on the information fusion and fuzzy logic is proposed. Among them, semi-cauchy lifting function was used as the subordinating function to replace the original binary function for boundary fuzzification of the criterion coding boundary. Furthermore, the coding criteria are expressed as subordinating function to form the subordinating correlation matrix. For diagnosis logic reasoning, “intersection” and “union” in fuzzy logic reasoning are respectively used to replace “and” and “or logic in binary logic to form multi-value output of fuzzy decision. The diagnosis results represent the probability of occurrence of different fault types.},

@article{9169782,
 abstract = {Goal: This article presents the design and validation of an accurate automatic diagnostic system to classify intramuscular EMG (iEMG) signals into healthy, myopathy, or neuropathy categories to aid the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases. Methods: First, an iEMG signal is decimated to produce a set of “disjoint” downsampled signals, which are decomposed by the lifting wavelet transform (LWT). The Higuchi's fractal dimensions (FDs) of LWT coefficients in the subbands are computed. The FDs of LWT subband coefficients are fused with one-dimensional local binary pattern derived from each downsampled signal. Next, a multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) determines the class labels of downsampled signals. Finally, the sequence of class labels is fed to the Boyer-Moore majority vote (BMMV) algorithm, which assigns a class to every iEMG signal. Results: The MLPNN-BMMV classifier was experimented with 250 iEMG signals belonging to three categories. The performance of the classifier was validated in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. The MLPNN-BMMV has resulted in impressive performance measures (%) using a 10-fold cross-validation—accuracy = $99.87\pm 0.25$, sensitivity (normal) = $99.97\pm 0.13$, sensitivity (myopathy) = $99.68\pm 0.95$, sensitivity (neuropathy) = $99.76\pm 0.66$, specificity (normal) = $99.72\pm 0.61$, specificity (myopathy) = $99.98\pm 0.10$, and specificity (neuropathy) = $99.96\pm 0.14$—surpassing the existing approaches. Conclusions: A future research direction is to validate the classifier performance with diverse iEMG datasets, which would lead to the design of an affordable real-time expert system for neuromuscular disorder diagnosis.},

 abstract = {Recently, the ability of different algorithms to create complexity of face recognition is exchanged with. plastic surgery due to skin differences. Although plastic surgery is a serious problem in facial expression, a major concern to be studied in terms of hypothetical and diagnostic ideas. In this article, it is anticipated that the removal of the histogram-based markers of the site of formation and adaptive gradient adaptation (AGLOH) will allow obtaining an effective facial recognition of plastic surgery. The elements are extracted from a small gap of the granules of the surface area. In the textbook, a variety of local binary models will outline moving AGLOH characteristics. Therefore, magnitude of characteristics is abbreviated as primary object analysis as it provide training to ANN. In essence, neural network is made up of trainees who use particle swarm optimization (PSO) rather than standard learning algorithms. These tests are performed on 150 face-to-face plastic surgeries, including blepharoplasty, eyebrow lifting, lip shaving, malar enlargement, mentoplasty, otoplasty, rhinoplasty, rhytidectomy, skin peeling. Finally, it is proved that the algorithm proposed in the article shows its unique performance.},

 abstract = {Mapping a binary function taken from a compiled binary to the same function in the original source code has many security applications, such as discovering reused free open source code in malware binaries. To facilitate malware analysis, we present BINDEEP, a framework that learns the semantic relationships among binary functions based on assembly code. It also learns semantic information about the source functions in order to carry out function matching. We demonstrate how BINDEEP can be applied to fingerprint the origin of functions in malware binaries, and then benchmark its performance against that of five competing systems (i.e., RESOURCE, the Binary Analysis Tool (BAT), BinPro, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), and FOSSIL). The findings show that BINDEEP is more robust and achieves significant improvement over these existing systems when confronted with changes introduced by code transformation methods or the use of different compilers and optimization levels. Furthermore, BINDEEP is able to discover source packages in malware binaries, such as Zeus and Citadel, that match those listed in existing security reports.},

 abstract = {Many work activities can imply a biomechanical overload. Among these activities, lifting loads may determine work-related musculoskeletal disorders. In order to limit injuries, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) proposed a methodology for assessing biomechanical risk in lifting tasks by means of a math formula based on intensity, duration, frequency and other geometrical characteristic of the lifting. In this work, we explored the feasibility of tree-based machine learning algorithms to classify biomechanical risk according to the Revised NIOSH lifting equation. Electromyography signals acquired from the biceps during lifting loads were collected using a wearable sensors for surface electromyography on a study population composed of 5 healthy young subjects. The EMG signals were segmented in order to extract the region of interest related to the lifting actions and for each region of interest several features in time and frequency domains were extracted. High results - greater than 95% - were obtained in terms of evaluation metrics for a binary risk/no-risk classification. In conclusion, this work indicates the proposed combination of features and machine learning algorithms represents a valid approach to automatically classify risk activities according to the Revised NISOH lifting equation. Future investigation on enriched study population could confirm the potentiality of this methodology to automatically classify potential risky activities.},
