Abstract = {Binary lifting is a key component in binary analysis tools. In order to
   guarantee the correctness of binary lifting, researchers have proposed
   various formally verified lifters. However, such formally verified
   lifters have too strict requirements on binary, which do not
   sufficiently reflect real-world lifters. In addition, real-world lifters
   use heuristic-based assumptions to lift binary code, which makes it
   difficult to guarantee the correctness of the lifted code using formal
   methods. In this paper, we propose a new interpretation of the
   correctness of real-world binary lifting. We formalize the process of
   binary lifting with heuristic-based assumptions used in real-world
   lifters by dividing it into a series of transformations, where each
   transformation represents a lift with new abstraction features. We
   define the correctness of each transformation as filtered-simulation,
   which is a variant of bi-simulation, between programs before and after
   transformation. We present three essential transformations in binary
   lifting and formalize them: (1) control flow graph reconstruction, (2)
   abstract stack reconstruction, and (3) function input/output
   identification. We implement our approach for x86-64 Linux binaries,
   named FibLE, and demonstrate that it can correctly lift Coreutils and
   CGC datasets compiled with GCC.},

Abstract = {Owing to the development of next-generation network and data processing
   technologies, massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming
   hyperconnected. As a result, Linux malware is being created to attack
   such hyperconnected networks by exploiting security threats in IoT
   devices. To determine the potential threats of such Linux malware and
   respond effectively, malware classification through an analysis of the
   executed code is required; however, a limitation exists in that each
   heterogeneous architecture must be analyzed separately. However, the
   binary codes of a heterogeneous architecture can be translated to a
   high-level intermediate representation (IR) of the same format using
   binary lifting and malicious behavior information can be identified
   because the functions and parameters of the assembly code are stored in
   the IR. Consequently, this study suggests a Linux malware classification
   method applicable to various architectures by converting Linux assembly
   codes into an IR using binary lifting and then learning the IR Sequence
   which reflects malicious behavior pattern using deep learning model for
   sequence learning.},

Abstract = {Although the slicing of programs written in a high-level language has
   been widely studied in the literature, relatively few papers have been
   published on the slicing of binary executable programs. The lack of
   existing solutions for the latter is really hard to understand since the
   application domain for slicing binaries is similar to that for slicing
   high-level languages. Furthermore, there are special applications of the
   slicing of programs without source code like source code recovery, code
   transformation and the detection of security critical code fragments. In
   this paper, in addition to describing the method of interprocedural
   static slicing of binaries, we discuss how the set of the possible
   targets of indirect call sites can be reduced by dynamically gathered
   information. Our evaluation of the slicing method shows that, if
   indirect function calls are extensively used, both the number of edges
   in the call graph and the size of the slices can be significantly
   reduced.},

Abstract = {We describe a system which decompiles (reverse engineers) C programs
   from target machine code by type-inference techniques. This extends
   recent trends in the converse process of compiling high-level languages
   whereby type information is preserved during compilation. The algorithms
   remain independent of the particular architecture by virtue of treating
   target instructions as register-transfer specifications. Target code
   expressed in such RTL form is then transformed into SSA form (undoing
   register colouring etc.); this then generates a set of type constraints.
   Iteration and recursion over data-structures causes synthesis of
   appropriate recursive C structs; this is triggered by and resolves
   occurs-check constraint violation. Other constraint violations are
   resolved by C's casts and unions. In the limit we use heuristics to
   select between equally suitable C code-a good GUI would clearly
   facilitate its professional use.},
