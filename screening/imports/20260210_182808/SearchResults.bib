  abstract = {WebAssembly (abbreviated WASM) is a low-level bytecode language designed for client-side execution in web browsers. As WASM continues to gain widespread adoption and its security concerns, the need for decompilation techniques that recover high-level source code from WASM binaries has grown. However, little research has been done to assess the quality of decompiled code from WASM. This paper aims to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis between decompiled C code from WASM binaries and state-of-the-art native binary decompilers. To achieve this goal, we presented a novel framework for empirically evaluating C-based decompilers from various aspects, thus assessing the proficiency of WASM decompilers in generating readable and correct code when compared to native binary decompilers. Specifically, we evaluated the decompiled code’s correctness , readability , and structural similarity with the original code from current WASM decompilers. We validated the proposed metrics’ practicality in decompiler assessment and provided insightful observations regarding the characteristics and constraints of existing decompiled code. By encouraging improvements in these tools, we seek to enhance their use in critical tasks such as auditing and sandboxing third-party libraries. This, in turn, contributes to bolstering the security and reliability of software systems that rely on WASM and native binaries.},

  abstract = {Decompilers are tools that reverse the process of compilation, converting executable binaries into a high-level language like C. They are useful in situations where the original source code is unavailable, such as when analyzing malware, doing vulnerability research, and patching legacy software. Unfortunately, decompilation is necessarily incomplete, because the compiler discards many of the abstractions that make source code readable, like identifier names and types. A large body of existing work uses machine learning to predict missing names, types, and other abstractions in decompiled code. However, little of this work considers obfuscations : semantics-preserving transformations that obscure the functionality and design of a program. At the same time, obfuscations are common in practice, especially in malware. In this work, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact that obfuscations have on decompiled code. Further, we investigate the degree to which training on obfuscated code mitigates the impact of obfuscations. We perform our experiments on three different models from the literature: DIRTY, HexT5, and VarBERT. We find that obfuscations do negatively impact machine learning models, but training on obfuscations can partially help recover lost accuracy.},

It has been widely used when analysts perform security analysis on software (systems) whose source code is unavailable, such as vulnerability search and malware analysis. However, current decompilation tools usually need lots of experts’ efforts, even for years, to generate the rules for decompilation, which also requires long-term maintenance as the syntax of high-level PL or low-level PL changes. Also, an ideal decompiler should concisely generate high-level PL with similar functionality to the source low-level PL. In this paper, we propose a novel neural decompilation approach to translate low-level PL into accurate high-level PL. We design a transformer-based neural network model, including a data dependency-based masked self-attention scheme and an instruction embedding scheme that accurately learns the mapping rules between low-level PLs and high-level PLs. We also propose a new intermediate language representation to bridge the information asymmetry between high-level and low-level PL. Furthermore, we implement the proposed approach called ANDE . Evaluations of four real-world applications show that ANDE has an average accuracy of 94.41\%, much better than prior neural machine translation (NMT) models.},

  abstract = {Decompilation technology has long been a pivotal tool in the field of computer software reverse engineering. Traditional decompilation methods frequently result in code that is structurally incomplete, semantically incoherent, and of low readability. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application to decompilation tasks, the field of decompilation research has witnessed notable advancements. Nevertheless, the performance of these models in decompiling C language programs on ARM platforms remains less than optimal. In this paper, we propose an inlined data processing algorithm to address the prevalent phenomenon of inlined data in ARM architecture, thereby enhancing the quality of the training dataset. Leveraging this, we have developed ARMQwen2, the first LLM that significantly improves the decompilation output quality of C programs on the ARM platform through fine-tuning techniques. We evaluate it under two test benchmarks and two different optimization levels, and the experimental results demonstrate that ARMQwen2 attains a re-executablility rate of up to 55\%, which is more than twice as high as Ghidra, the current state-of-the-art decompiler, and 20\% higher than the advanced large language model GPT-4o-mini. In terms of re-compilability and edit similarity, ARMQwen2 achieves an average of 90\% and 60\% respectively.},

The current consensus is that these systems have to include considerable domain knowledge and iterative heuristic components to solve parts of the decompilation problem, particularly the problem of predicting identifiers and literals. In this paper, we present a single-pass end-to-end neural decompilation system that utilizes copying mechanism . The copying mechanism is able to copy the literals and (offsets of) variables directly from the assembly code, in a single step , as part of the single forward pass through the model. Additionally, we take a further step toward decompiling real-world code by addressing important programming constructs like switch statements, function definitions, and function calls. We compile a dataset of real-world programming competition code and evaluate our model on it.

We utilize Transformer Compiler for RASP (Tracr) to generate a large dataset of pairs of transformer weights and corresponding RASP programs. Based on this dataset, we then build and train a model, with the aim of recovering the RASP code from the compiled model. We demonstrate that the simple form of Tracr compiled transformer weights is interpretable for such a decompiler model. In an empirical evaluation, our model achieves exact reproductions on more than 30\% of the test objects, while the remaining 70\% can generally be reproduced with only few errors. Additionally, more than 70\% of the programs, produced by our model, are functionally equivalent to the ground truth, and therefore a valid decompilation of the Tracr compiled transformer weights.},

  abstract = {Abstract Decompilers are indispensable tools in Android malware analysis and app security auditing. Numerous academic works also employ an Android decompiler as the first step in a program analysis pipeline. In such settings, decompilation is frequently regarded as a “solved” problem, in that it is simply expected that source code can be accurately recovered from an app. On the other hand, it is known that, e.g, obfuscation can negatively impact a decompiler’s effectiveness. Therefore, in order to better understand potential failure modes of, e.g., automated analysis pipelines involving decompilation, it is important to characterize the performance of decompilers on both benign and malicious apps. To this end, we have performed what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale study of Android decompilation failure rates, using three sets of apps; namely, 3,018 open-source apps, 13,601 apps crawled from Google Play, and an existing collection of 24,553 malware samples. In addition to the state-of-the-art Dalvik bytecode decompiler Jadx, we also studied the performance of three popular Java decompilers. Furthermore, this paper also presents the findings from a follow-up study on 54,945 malware apps, where we additionally performed an analysis of the reasons for decompilation failures. Our study revealed that decompilers generally have very low failure rates, and that few failures on benign apps appear to be related to obfuscation. On malware, however, obfuscation appears to be a more prominent cause of failures, although the vast majority of malicious apps could still be fully decompiled by an ensemble of decompilers.},

  abstract = {Binary and source matching is vital for vulnerability detection or program comprehension. Most existing works focus on library matching (coarse-grained) by utilizing some simple features. However, they are so coarse-grained that high false positives occur since developers tend to reuse source code library partly. These shortcomings drive us to perform fine-grained matching (i.e., binary and source function matching). At the same time, due to the enormous differences between the form of binary and source functions, function matching (fine-grained) meets huge challenges. In this work, inspired by the decompilation technique and advanced neural networks, we propose tool, a D ecompilation based deep B inary- S ource function M atching framework. Specifically, we take the triplet features from both binary pseudo-code and source code functions as input, which are extracted from code property graph and can represent both the syntactic and semantic information. In this way, the binary and source functions are represented in the same feature space so to ease the matching model to learn function similarity. For the matching model, we adopt a self-attention based siamese network with contrastive loss. Experiments on two datasets, R 0 and R 3, show that our tool achieves consistent improvements than other methods, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-attention based matching model, and our triplets features can well capture the two kinds of code functions. Our work improves the accuracy of binary and source code matching, which in turn enables us to better address security issues such as vulnerability detection and program comprehension.},

However, it is susceptible to several malware attacks that may seriously compromise the privacy and security of individuals and organizations.

In particular, the proposed approach, named , implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for binary classification (malware versus goodware), and integrates algorithm to disclose how specific API classes and control-flow edges between API calls influence malware alerts. The proposed approach was evaluated by considering 26,527 Android APKs. The results of an extensive and in-depth evaluation show that the presented GNN model achieves higher accuracy than deep neural models trained with traditional API call sequence representations and publicly available related methods. On the other hand, it produces decision explanations that yield interesting insights into the malicious patterns of APKs and support root cause analysis of missed malware alarms.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts on Ethereum have driven the development of decentralized financial applications, but they have also become a breeding ground for fraudulent activities, particularly Ponzi schemes. These schemes often obscure the flow of funds and the relationships among participants, making their true nature difficult to detect–especially when only the contract’s bytecode is publicly available. Conventional detection methods largely depend on access to source code or large-scale labeled datasets to train supervised learning models. However, in real-world blockchain environments, only compiled bytecode is typically accessible on-chain, and obtaining labeled data is costly and often impractical. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to identify Ponzi schemes directly from Ethereum bytecode, without relying on source code or labeled data. Under a zero-shot setting, we utilize large language models to interpret and assess critical code fragments extracted from the contract, aiming to judge whether their functionality matches typical Ponzi-like fund behaviors. Our method first decompiles the bytecode into an intermediate form that preserves key semantic information, then constructs a data flow graph to represent data dependencies and control flow relationships within the contract. Based on this graph, we apply a set of manually defined rules to locate and extract code segments that are strongly related to fund transfer logic. These segments are then provided to the language model for further reasoning and judgment. By integrating bytecode analysis with LLM-based interpretation, our method can detect suspicious fund flow patterns even when the original source code is not available.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile internet and the increasing number of smartphone users, various applications have become easily accessible. Although most mobile applications publish corresponding privacy policies before being re-leased on app markets, there persists a critical issue of inconsistency between declared privacy policies and actual application behaviors, leading to user privacy breaches. This makes the detection and analysis of privacy leakage behaviors in Android applications and their third-party libraries an urgent research challenge. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which focuses on enabling effective human-machine interaction through natural language, proves particularly suitable for analyzing decompiled Android bytecode as an inspection medium. By employing NLP-based semantic analysis for static code examination, this research addresses privacy leakage detection in Android applications. This paper presents an NLP-based system for detecting consistency between application privacy policies and behaviors. The system utilizes NLP techniques to extract and process privacy-related declarations from policy documents and sensitive behaviors from applications. Through static analysis, it distinguishes actual sensitive behaviors and private data handling between core applications and third-party libraries. The system establishes a correlation model by mapping permission requirements with privacy information disclosures, ultimately achieving consistency verification. For experimental validation, we selected 100 Chinese mobile applications and their third-party libraries. Experimental results reveal that approximately 80\% of applications exhibited inconsistencies between documented policies and actual behaviors (including third-party components).},

  abstract = {Abstract Reverse engineering complex proprietary software is a tedious and time consuming task. A fair amount of the overall effort is usually devoted to locating those software components which are responsible for the functionality of interest (e.g., a proprietary encryption algorithm). To aid this process, several tools, available in the public domain, can be used, implementing sophisticated algorithms for control-flow recovery, stack frame recovery, data type inference, decompilation etc. However, the important problem of decomposing a binary executable to its constituent object files (or compile-units) has not been, in our opinion, sufficiently studied. In this paper we present novel techniques for estimating the number, as well as the boundaries, of compile-units in binary executables. We present algorithms which recover information that improves the precision degree in reverse engineering tasks. In addition, our algorithms can be used to reduce the effort of locating, recovering and understanding specific functionalities of closed-source software. We evaluate our algorithms on the public DeepBinDiff ELF dataset, consisting of \$\$\\approx\$\$ 2000 binaries, as well as two larger executables of GNU GDB, built for ARM and AArch64 and show that they consistently approach the ground-truth, with an average recovery precision close to 75\%. Furthermore, we show how our research can aid in binary diffing applications, by comparing the recovered compile-unit structure of a pair of Microsoft Windows kernel images. We make our prototype implementation, written in Python and named REcover , publicly available for further evaluation by the reverse engineering community.},

This study proposes a low complexity decompression method for commercial FPGA bitstreams, which is a crucial step for assessing the security of FPGAs. By comparing the structure of compressed and uncompressed bitstream files, we identify the compression region, extract the compressed data, and construct a database for the mapping information. Then, we introduce a decoding algorithm that utilizes a sliding window approach based on the characteristics of the compressed data and implement the algorithm on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on 24 different types of Intel FPGAs from 6 families, with a perfect accuracy rate of 100\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to disclose a decompression method for commercial FPGAs.},

  abstract = {VR devices are a rapidly emerging type of sensory terminal device in the context of the metaverse, with its immersive use effects attracting a large number of users to experience. However, with the continuous development of virtual reality technology, an increasing number of criminal incidents in the virtual world have raised concerns. VR devices are developed based on the Android system but have their unique security mechanisms. Therefore, how to securely extract and preserve data from VR devices is a crucial concern for digital forensic practitioners. This paper first proposes a method for application data extraction and analysis in a non root environment within the VR ecosystem based on the Linux shared user id mechanism. This method utilizes Edge Developer Tools to debug Vuplex 3D Webview, enabling the extraction of internal storage data from embedded web pages within the application. Subsequently, a combination of decompilation and packet capture techniques is used to analyze the data transmission methods and data interaction logic of applications in the VR ecosystem. Finally, based on the experimental results, a comprehensive assessment of the security of VR devices is conducted in the paper. Data extraction from VR devices is an indispensable part of digital forensics in the era of the metaverse. The research on methods for extracting and analyzing application data in the VR ecosystem in this paper provides valuable reference for future forensic work on VR devices.},

  abstract = {Abstract Decompilation aims to analyze and transform low-level program language (PL) codes such as binary code or assembly code to obtain an equivalent high-level PL. Decompilation plays a vital role in the cyberspace security fields such as software vulnerability discovery and analysis, malicious code detection and analysis, and software engineering fields such as source code analysis, optimization, and cross-language cross-operating system migration. Unfortunately, the existing decompilers mainly rely on experts to write rules, which leads to bottlenecks such as low scalability, development difficulties, and long cycles. The generated high-level PL codes often violate the code writing specifications. Further, their readability is still relatively low. The problems mentioned above hinder the efficiency of advanced applications (e.g., vulnerability discovery) based on decompiled high-level PL codes.In this paper, we propose a decompilation approach based on the attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) mechanism, which converts low-level PL into high-level PL while acquiring legibility and keeping functionally similar. To compensate for the information asymmetry between the low-level and high-level PL, a translation method based on basic operations of low-level PL is designed. This method improves the generalization of the NMT model and captures the translation rules between PLs more accurately and efficiently. Besides, we implement a neural decompilation framework called Neutron. The evaluation of two practical applications shows that Neutron’s average program accuracy is 96.96\%, which is better than the traditional NMT model.},

SMT solvers, which serve as a foundation for these tools, have thus increased support for bitvector reasoning through bit-blasting and linear arithmetic approximations. In this paper we show that similar linear arithmetic approximation of bitvector operations can be done at the source level through transformations. Specifically, we introduce new paths that over-approximate bitvector operations with linear conditions/constraints, increasing branching but allowing us to better exploit the well-developed integer reasoning and interpolation of verification tools. We show that, for reachability of bitvector programs, increased branching incurs negligible overhead yet, when combined with integer interpolation optimizations, enables more programs to be verified. We further show this exploitation of integer interpolation in the common case also enables competitive termination verification of bitvector programs and leads to the first effective technique for linear temporal logic (LTL) verification of bitvector programs. Finally, we provide an in-depth case study of decompiled (“lifted”) binary programs, which emulate X86 execution through frequent use of bitvector operations. We present a new tool DarkSea , the first tool capable of verifying reachability, termination and LTL of lifted binaries.},

  abstract = {For the Android app market, malware uses code encryption techniques for block detection. For Android applications, scholars have proposed a method to determine whether Android applications are malicious software by analyzing the behavioral characteristics of software operation. The most traditional method is static detection, which is characterized by fast detection speed and less resource occupation. However, Android software cannot be detected by static methods after using encryption technology. The APK package of the application is first decompiled to detect and extract key features, behavioral patterns, and invocation information using Frida and Camille. Subsequently, the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is employed to analyze software intent for determining the presence of malware. The experimental results demonstrate that the static method achieves an accuracy of approximately 80\%, whereas the dynamic method achieves an accuracy of 91\%. Through the utilization of software intention analysis and permission usage checks in combination, the accuracy rate can be further enhanced to 94\%. Upon comparison of the different algorithms utilized in each detection method, it is concluded that both the KNN and random forest algorithms exhibit higher accuracy in the application of such detection methods.},

However, such information is useful when statically analyzing programs that utilize structured exceptions. To fill that gap, we propose the concept of Exceptional Interprocedural Control Flow Graphs (EICFGs) . These graphs extend traditional CFGs by adding edges for stack unwinding, frame cleanup, and try/catch behavior caused by thrown exceptions. We provide an approach for generating EICFGs from x86-64 binaries featuring C++ exceptions. The approach is based on symbolically executing an abstract semantics that includes binary-level exception-related function calls. We validated our abstract semantics by generating concrete test cases that were then evaluated using real binaries. We applied an implementation of our approach to 341 off-the-shelf x86-64 binaries compiled from C++ as well as C and Fortran source code. From those binaries, we identified 2574 unique throws and successfully resolved the exceptional control flow for every one of them. We show that resolving throws leads to increased instruction reachability and uncovers edges not found by state-of-the-art tools such as Ghidra.},

  abstract = {Abstract From logical reasoning to mental simulation, biological and artificial neural systems possess an incredible capacity for computation. Such neural computers offer a fundamentally novel computing paradigm by representing data continuously and processing information in a natively parallel and distributed manner. To harness this computation, prior work has developed extensive training techniques to understand existing neural networks. However, the lack of a concrete and low-level machine code for neural networks precludes us from taking full advantage of a neural computing framework. Here we provide such a machine code along with a programming framework by using a recurrent neural network—a reservoir computer—to decompile, code and compile analogue computations. By decompiling the reservoir’s internal representation and dynamics into an analytic basis of its inputs, we define a low-level neural machine code that we use to program the reservoir to solve complex equations and store chaotic dynamical systems as random-access memory. We further provide a fully distributed neural implementation of software virtualization and logical circuits, and even program a playable game of pong inside of a reservoir computer. Importantly, all of these functions are programmed without requiring any example data or sampling of state space. Finally, we demonstrate that we can accurately decompile the analytic, internal representations of a full-rank reservoir computer that has been conventionally trained using data. Taken together, we define an implementation of neural computation that can both decompile computations from existing neural connectivity and compile distributed programs as new connections.},

In response to such attacks, both academia and industry have investigated techniques to model and reconstruct these attacks and to defend against them. While such efforts have been all useful in mitigating the effects of modern attacks, automated malware code reuse inspection and campaign attribution have received less attention. In this paper, we present an automated system, called SCRUTINIZER , to identify code reuse in malware via a novel machine learning-based encoding mechanism at the function-level. By creating a large knowledge base of previously observed and tagged malware campaigns, we can compare unknown samples against this knowledge base and determine how much overlap exists. SCRUTINIZER leverages an unsupervised learning approach to filter out irrelevant functions before code reuse detection. It provides two valuable capabilities. First, it identifies ties between an unknown sample and those malware specimens that are known to be used by a specific campaign. Second, it inspects if specific tools or functionalities are used by a campaign. Using SCRUTINIZER , we were able to identify 12 samples that were previously unknown to us and that we were able to correctly assign to well-known APT campaigns.},

  abstract = {Abstract Decompilation is currently a widely used tool in reverse engineering and exploit detection in binaries. Ghidra, developed by the National Security Agency, is one of the most popular decompilers. It decompiles binaries to high P-Code, from which the final decompilation output in C code is generated. Ghidra allows users to work with P-Code, so users can analyze the intermediate representation directly. Several projects make use of this to build tools that perform verification, decompilation, taint analysis and emulation, to name a few. P-Code lacks a formal semantics, and its documentation is limited. It has a notoriously subtle semantics, which makes it hard to do any sort of analysis on P-Code. We show that P-Code, as-is, cannot be given an executable semantics. In this paper, we augment P-Code and define a complete, executable, formal semantics for it. This is done by looking at the documentation and the decompilation results of binaries with known source code. The development of a formal P-Code semantics uncovered several issues in Ghidra, P-Code, and the documentation. We show that these issues affect projects that rely on Ghidra and P-Code. We evaluate the executability of our semantics by building a P-Code interpreter that directly uses our semantics. Our work uncovered several issues in Ghidra and allows Ghidra users to better leverage P-Code.},

The main novelty is that it can deal with pure java virtual machine and can generate parallel code for multicore processors.

  abstract = {Despite the large number of approaches proposed for detecting malicious applications targeting platforms such as Android, malware continuously evolves in order to avoid its detection and reach the users. Likewise, malware detection engines are continuously improved, trying to detect the most modern malware. Most of these detection tools employ signatures or machine learning models, trained on thousands of features, such as API calls, permissions or using taint analysis, among many others, and using machine learning classification algorithms such as decision trees, ensemble methods or deep learning. However, the use of these features leads to biased models due to the use of limited datasets, without considering the real semantics (goals and intentions) of the malicious sample. In this paper, we conduct an initial study of the use of context and semantic aware embeddings generated with the CodeT5 pre-trained language model for a better representation of the behaviour of Android applications. After decompiling a sample to Java, it is possible to generate embeddings from chunks of the source code, generating a rich representation of the sample. We show how these embeddings can be used to train a recurrent neural network for malware detection tasks, evidencing promising results.},

  abstract = {Malware detection is an important task in software maintenance. It can effectively protect user information from the attack of malicious developers. Existing studies mainly focus on leveraging permission information and API call information to identify malware. However, many studies pay attention to the API call without considering the role of API call sequences. In this study, we propose a new method by combining both the permission information and the API call sequence information to distinguish malicious applications from benign applications. First, we extract features of permission and API call sequence with a decompiling tool. Then, one-hot encoding and Word2Vec are adopted to represent the permission feature and the API call sequence feature for each application, respectively. Based on this, we leverage Random Forest (RF) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a permission-based classifier and an API call sequence-based classifier, respectively. Finally, we design a linear strategy to combine the outputs of these two classifiers to predict the labels of newly arrived applications. By an evaluation with 15,198 malicious applications and 15,129 benign applications, our approach achieves 98.84\% in terms of precision, 98.17\% in terms of recall, 98.50\% in terms of F1-score, and 98.52\% in terms of accuracy on average, and outperforms the state-of-art method Malscan by 2.12\%, 0.27\%, 1.20\%, and 1.24\%, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate that the method combining two features achieves better performance than the methods based on a single feature.},

  abstract = {We present FoxDec: an approach to C code decompilation that aims at producing sound and recompilable code. Formal methods are used during three phases of the decompilation process: control flow recovery, symbolic execution, and variable analysis. The use of formal methods minimizes the trusted code base and ensures soundness: the extracted C code behaves the same as the original binary. Soundness and recompilablity enable C code decompilation to be used in the contexts of binary patching, binary porting, binary analysis and binary improvement, with confidence that the recompiled code’s behavior is consistent with the original program. We demonstrate that FoxDec can be used to improve execution speed by recompiling a binary with different compiler options, to patch a memory leak with a code transformation tool, and to port a binary to a different architecture. FoxDec can also be leveraged to port a binary to run as a unikernel, a minimal and secure virtual machine usually requiring source access for porting.},

  abstract = {Android phones have gained popularity since 2008, attracting many malware threats. To identify these threats, researchers have proposed various models. Most models for classifying malware rely on machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, these techniques have some limitations, including the requirement of a large amount of data to achieve accurate classification, bias towards certain samples, and the potential for overfitting to new data. In this study, we opted not to use these techniques and instead employed correlation coefficients to identify distinguishing pairs of permissions and intents. We propose a novel detection model named PICCdroid that first cleans the data to remove irrelevant features and extracts feature pairs, i.e., pairs of permissions and intents combined. Further, we calculate Yule’s correlation coefficient score for feature pairs for both normal and malware datasets. The calculated correlation coefficient score is then used to determine whether the testing application is normal or malicious. The evaluation results show that our proposed model, incorporating Yule’s correlation, can accurately classify 99.14\% of the applications, outperforming various other correlation techniques and many state-of-the-art detection methods.},

  abstract = {Abstract Many Android apps collect data from users, and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) mandates clear disclosures of such data collection. However, apps often use third-party code, complicating accurate disclosures. This paper investigates how accurately current Android apps fulfill these requirements. In this work, we present a multi-layered definition of privacy-related data to correctly report data collection in Android apps. We further create a dataset of privacy-sensitive data classes that may be used as input by an Android app. This dataset takes into account data collected both through the user interface and system APIs. Based on this, we implement a semi-automated prototype that detects and labels privacy-related data collected by a given Android app. We manually examine the data safety sections of 70 Android apps to observe how data collection is reported, identifying instances of over- and under-reporting. We compare our prototype’s results with the data safety sections of 20 apps revealing reporting discrepancies. Using the results from two Messaging and Social Media apps (Signal and Instagram), we discuss how app developers under-report and over-report data collection, respectively, and identify inaccurately reported data categories. A broader study of 7,500 Android apps reveals that apps most frequently collect data that can partially identify users. Although system APIs consistently collect large amounts of privacy-related data, user interfaces exhibit some more diverse data collection patterns. A more focused study on various domains of apps reveals that the largest fraction of apps collecting personal data belong to the domain of Messaging and Social Media . Our findings show that location is collected frequently by apps, specially from the E-commerce and Shopping domain. However, it is often under-reported in app data safety sections. Our results highlight the need for greater consistency in privacy-aware app development and reporting practices.},

  abstract = {Mobile AI applications enhance functionality but introduce complex privacy and security challenges. This research develops and evaluates an automated framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze user reviews and unveil “hidden permissions” defined not as technically undeclared functionalities, but as declared permissions whose purpose or necessity is opaque to users, leading to perceived privacy risks. The framework integrates static analysis of permission manifests with a hybrid Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline that combines Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) with BERT embeddings. A fine-tuned RoBERTa model then classifies user-reported concerns into predefined risk categories. We correlate these user-reported behaviors with declared permissions to identify potential mismatches and prioritize them using a risk-scoring methodology validated against the MITRE Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database. In an evaluation against other LLM architectures (GPT-3.5, DistilBERT, XLNet, and LLaMA-2), our fine-tuned RoBERTa model demonstrates superior performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.90 in classifying reviews related to unauthorized tracking. The framework effectively surfaces and prioritizes user-perceived privacy risks, offering actionable insights for developers to address mismatches between an app’s declared permissions and its user-experienced behavior, thereby fostering a more secure and trustworthy AI mobile ecosystem.},

In answering what advancements these approaches offer, we identified three primary benefits: the democratization of compiler development, the discovery of novel optimization strategies, and the broadening of the compiler’s traditional scope. Finally, in addressing the field’s challenges and opportunities, we highlighted the critical hurdles of ensuring correctness and achieving scalability, while identifying the development of hybrid systems as the most promising path forward.

  abstract = {Many malware detection methods have been developed for Android. One way is to detect Android malware by representing Android applications (hereinafter, “apps”) as a method call graph. However, there are cases where common libraries are included in the analysis target, and if these libraries are also included in the graph, the detection accuracy is affected and also graph size is unnecessarily large because they represent behaviors that do not occur in the original application. One way to deal with common libraries is to add them to a white list and exclude them from analysis, but since there are many common libraries, it is difficult to exclude all of them in practice. In this study, we define two types of component graphs, devise an algorithm for generating component graphs, and propose an Android malware detection method using component graphs in order to improve the detection rate of Android malware. To confirm whether component graphs are effective for malware detection, we used graph neural networks as a classification algorithm and conducted experiments to evaluate the accuracy of Android malware detection using component graphs and method call graphs. The results showed that our proposed method using component graphs, which are much smaller graphs than method call graphs, succeeded in detecting malware with 96.18\% accuracy, which is comparable with that of method call graphs.},

Our approach uses a semantic-enhanced code property graph that serves as a compatibility layer. Based on the compatibility layer, the framework recovers high-level system design and infers original business intent from implementation details, while providing both programmatic access through structured APIs and natural language interaction through LLM-based agents.

  abstract = {Binary program vulnerability detection is an important issue in the field of software security. Most of the existing deep learning vulnerability detection methods for binary programs are based on RNN networks or transformer architectures. Due to the characteristic of short length of assembly instruction but long length of instruction sequence, traditional RNNs may encounter gradient vanishing or exploding problems, making it difficult to capture long-term dependencies when dealing with long sequences. Transformer architecture, although it has excellent performance, has high computational complexity, which leads to inefficient detection. In this work, we propose a new binary program code vulnerability detection method that employs a staged code representation architecture and a novel xLSTM model. The staged code representation architecture combines instruction coding network and program coding network to capture long-term dependencies vulnerable instructions, thus improving binary program vulnerability detection performance. The xLSTM improves the performance of binary program vulnerability detection with low resource overhead. Our method achieves the highest F1-meansure and recall compared with the SOTA methods. Our method can achieve comparable performance of transformers architecture with reduced resource overhead. These results demonstrate the advantages of our approach for binary program vulnerability detection.},

However, the majority of existing deobfuscation research has primarily focused on the source code level, with limited effectiveness in deobfuscating binary code. Despite the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their effective application in the deobfuscation domain, there remains a lack of research leveraging LLMs for deobfuscating ARM binary code. In this paper, we construct a high-quality dataset of obfuscated ARM assembly code, comprising seven types of single obfuscations and seven types of multiple obfuscations. Based on this, we propose LLM-DAS, the first deobfuscation system specifically designed for ARM binary code and grounded in large language models. LLM-DAS consists of two finetuned large models tailored for obfuscation detection and deobfuscation, respectively, and we evaluate its performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the obfuscation detection component achieves an average accuracy and precision of 91.96\% and 94.94\%, respectively. In terms of deobfuscation performance, it attains a maximum average SacreBLEU score of 26.21, representing improvements of 20.09 and 17.11 compared to Llama3 and Qwen2.5, which have the same parameter scale. Furthermore, when evaluated against three metrics within the Obfuscation Quality Quantification Framework, LLM-DAS also outperforms the aforementioned two models.},

  abstract = {Deep learning-based source code vulnerability detection tools have gained popularity among developers for identifying security flaws in source code. However, these tools often exhibit poor generalization, achieving high accuracy only on datasets similar to their training data, and performing poorly (less than 20\% accuracy) in real-world environments. This performance gap is attributed not only to training data issues but also to anomalies in tool design, implementation, and robustness—factors typically overlooked in current research. Most existing works focus on improving datasets and algorithms, ignoring the fact that such tools, as software systems, also require systematic testing. This paper views deep learning-based detection tools as software and introduces a novel anomaly detection framework based on differential testing. Unlike prior approaches, our method targets not only common software faults but also deep learning-specific anomalies and those unique to vulnerability detection tools. We further propose a new test case mutation strategy to enhance differential testing effectiveness. Our system identifies, quantifies, and provides fixes for detected anomalies, supporting automated and efficient anomaly detection and repair.

Traditional malware detection methods, such as signature-based detection and traditional machine learning techniques, face significant challenges in addressing the polymorphism and obfuscation of modern malware. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GAI), particularly large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and CodeBERT, offer new opportunities for malware detection. GAI leverages self-supervised pretraining to understand code syntax and semantics, enabling automated feature extraction and high-level semantic pattern recognition from raw code. By analyzing the structure and behavior of malicious code, GAI can detect hidden threats, predict attack trends, and process complex multimodal data. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current challenges in malware detection, including issues with data imbalance, adversarial attacks, and the high cost of expert-labeled samples. It also explores how GAI-powered LLMs enhance static and dynamic analysis, enable multimodal detection, and improve explainability in malware analysis. By summarizing the contributions of GAI in this field, this paper highlights its transformative potential for malware detection methodologies and addresses future research directions.},

To mitigate this issue, we present two complementary techniques in this work: Prompt Engineering and External Dependency Retrieval for context enrichment. We evaluated our improvements through an ablation study on three open-source and four proprietary projects, encompassing 261 distinct methods. For each method, we generated test suites under four implementations and performed ten independent runs, yielding a total of 10,440 executions. Our combined approach yields an average coverage increase of 12\% on industrial software, with statistically significant gains over all other variants studied in this paper. Although our enhancements increase the context (the number of input tokens rises by 66.3\%), this is partially compensated by a reduction in output tokens due to fewer repair attempts, so that the overall cost overhead remains moderate at about 16\%. As future work, we aim to identify the minimal necessary context that still yields significant improvements in test coverage, which could help to further reduce costs.},

  abstract = {Binary Code Similarity Analysis (BCSA) has a wide spectrum of applications, including plagiarism detection, vulnerability discovery, and malware analysis, thus drawing significant attention from the security community. However, conventional techniques often face challenges in balancing both accuracy and scalability simultaneously. To overcome these existing problems, a surge of deep learning-based work has been recently proposed. Unfortunately, many researchers still find it extremely difficult to conduct relevant studies or extend existing approaches. First, prior work typically relies on proprietary benchmark without making the entire dataset publicly accessible. Consequently, a large-scale, well-labeled dataset for binary code similarity analysis remains precious and scarce. Moreover, previous work has primarily focused on comparing at the function level, rather than exploring other finer granularities. Therefore, we argue that the lack of a fine-grained dataset for BCSA leaves a critical gap in current research. To address these challenges, we construct a benchmark dataset for fine-grained binary code similarity analysis called BinSimDB , which contains equivalent pairs of smaller binary code snippets, such as basic blocks. Specifically, we propose BMerge and BPair algorithms to bridge the discrepancies between two binary code snippets caused by different optimization levels or platforms. Furthermore, we empirically study the properties of our dataset and evaluate its effectiveness for the BCSA research. The experimental results demonstrate that BinSimDB significantly improves the performance of binary code similarity comparison.},

  abstract = {Android’s dominance in the global mobile landscape has made it a prime target for increasingly evasive malware. While machine learning and deep learning have shown promise for Android malware detection, prior studies often evaluate isolated models or rely on narrow datasets, limiting real-world applicability. This paper proposes a unified experimental framework that benchmarks classical machine learning models and deep neural architectures using a hybrid dataset composed of both real-device and emulated Android malware. Features were carefully extracted and fused from static and dynamic sources to create a hybrid representation suitable for both lightweight classifiers and high-capacity deep networks. Seven models were evaluated, including Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbours, AdaBoost, Extra Trees, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The CNN-LSTM model achieved the highest detection accuracy of 99.82\%, validating the need for combining spatial and temporal learning from static and behavioural malware characteristics. Our findings shed light on the balance that must be struck between making models interpretable, keeping computational requirements reasonable, and achieving strong detection performance. By examining these aspects together, we hope this work will serve as a useful reference point for researchers who are developing or evaluating hybrid approaches to Android malware detection.},

  abstract = {The exponential rise in Android ransomware attacks poses severe security threats, leading to financial losses and privacy breaches for both individuals and businesses. Traditional signature-based detection techniques struggle against evolving ransomware variants, necessitating more advanced and adaptive detection mechanisms. This work proposes an approach that first employs Random Forest classification for structured feature-based analysis. To further enhance detection, JSON reports are transformed into images, and deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT), are applied for ransomware classification. We extracted behavioral reports from the CuckooDroid sandbox, collecting approximately 2280 ransomware reports and 2000 benign application reports. A Random Forest classifier trained on structured features achieves an accuracy of 99.41\%. To further enhance Android ransomware detection, we introduce a novel transformation of JSON reports into RGB images, enabling deep-learning models to classify ransomware patterns. Our CNN trained on RGB images attains 99.76\% accuracy, while a CNN trained on grayscale images achieves 99.53\%. Further, the ViT model trained on RGB images optimized using the grid search surpasses all models, achieving a peak accuracy of 99.78\%.},

  abstract = {The emergence of the Ethereum blockchain and the rise of Turing-complete smart contracts have led to the creation of new solutions for ensuring different kinds of termination. Indeed, non-termination of a smart-contract execution within the blockchain network may have critical consequences, ranging from slow performance to a complete denial of service in the worst scenarios. Furthermore, smart contracts lack a global access-control mechanism and may be executed indefinitely over time, even after they have exhausted their purposes. Therefore, this requires, in some cases, developing solutions implementing “soft” and “hard” terminations—such as pausable, interruptions, and kill-switch mechanisms—as well as providing safe termination guarantees. In addition, termination is even more crucial when we consider legal aspects of smart contracts, including compliance with laws and regulations, such as the smart contract requirements proposed by the European Union Data Act . In this paper, we explore several mechanisms to ensure various kinds of termination in Ethereum, the most widely used blockchain. Moreover, we investigate similar mechanisms for traditional programming languages that can be applied to smart contracts in the blockchain context. The primary purpose of this study is to fill the gap caused by the lack of standards for these mechanisms and the emerging solutions typically proposed by practitioners.},

  abstract = {Mobile devices, especially smartphones, have become an integral part of users’ personal and professional lives. Central to the expansive use and prevalence of mobile devices are mobile applications – software developed to enhance the functionality offered by these devices. Mobile applications offer unparalleled support for users, ranging from personal use to work-related activities. However, increased usage of mobile applications can pose serious security risks due to vulnerabilities or faults that may exist within the software. It becomes, therefore, imperative to evaluate mobile applications for security risks before releasing the software for either general or professional use. Such an evaluation of a mobile application is conducted via a security assessment, which aims to determine if a mobile application conforms to specified security requirements. The proper security assessment of a mobile application requires a framework to guide security analysts in applying techniques and approaches to eliminate risks and ensure resilience against attacks. This paper presents a reference model conceptualising the requirements needed to conduct a comprehensive security assessment of mobile applications. The reference model provides an abstraction of the phases, as well as the relationship between the phases, to guide the assessment of mobile application security. The outcome of this paper is a contribution to a commonly accepted domain definition for assessing mobile application security, ensuring that such assessments can be performed consistently and effectively.},

Bitcoin (and related cryptocurrencies) place strict limits on the language in which these conditions can be phrased. In particular, conditions have limited length and may not contain loops. In this work, we show how to augment the Bitcoin scripting language with a single “innocuous” operation to allow us to create “meta conditions” with much more expressive power (e.g., as defined by arbitrarily-sized circuits). We construct a protocol to compile such meta-conditions into a set of (augmented) Bitcoin transactions. We then show how to use this compiler to realize a full “meta-ledger” functionality, which we show is secure in the universal composability framework.},

Further, as more applications are moved to mobile apps (e.g., Android and iOS), the security has become a major issue. As mobile applications transition to cloud-based platforms and necessitate remote access, the spectrum of potential attacks has broadened. The increase in security vulnerabilities and threats poses a significant challenge for organizations in terms of management and mitigation. Consequently, it is crucial for both organizations and individuals to enhance their security measures. It is imperative that scientists and engineers allocate more time to the detection, verification, and mitigation of security vulnerabilities on a grand scale. This encompasses the code base, infrastructure, and corporate assets. A variety of security tools for detection and reporting are available in the market. Nevertheless, these systems often generate a high number of false positives that subsequently require manual verification by security engineers. To deal with these challenges, in this study a mobile app security assessment model called Mobile App Security Assessment Tool (MASAT) is developed in Python language. In the model, we assess the Android Application Package (APK) files and try to detect the security vulnerabilities through forensic analysis. The model was tested for a number of APK files and found to be working satisfactory. The model developed will aid in the verification of security vulnerabilities by security scanners, reducing false positives and ensuring the reproducibility of security vulnerabilities at scale.},

  abstract = {This paper presents BlockLens , a supervised, trace-level framework for detecting malicious Ethereum transactions using large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior approaches limited to static features or storage-level abstractions, BlockLens processes complete execution traces, capturing opcode sequences, memory information, gas usage, and call structures to accurately represent the runtime behavior of each transaction. This framework harnesses the exceptional reasoning capabilities of LLMs for long input sequences and is fine-tuned on transaction data. We design a tokenization strategy aligned with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) semantics, mapping execution traces into interpretable tokens. Each transaction captures its complete execution trace through simulated execution and is then sliced into overlapping chunks using a sliding window, allowing for long-range context modeling within memory constraints. During inference, the model outputs both a binary decision and a probability score indicating the likelihood of malicious behavior. We implement the framework based on LLaMA 3.2-1B backbone and fine-tune the model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). We evaluate it on a curated dataset containing both real-world attacks and normal DeFi transactions. BlockLens outperforms representative baselines, achieving higher F1 scores and recall at top-k thresholds than representative baselines. Additionally, BlockLens offers interpretable chunk-level outputs by localizing suspicious trace segments that enhance explainability, facilitating rapid forensic analysis and actionable decision-making in security-critical environments.},

  abstract = {Vulnerability poses a significant threat to software security. Under-constrained symbolic execution (UCSE) plays a prevalent role in vulnerability detection. It can initiate from any code region, enabling flexible and scalable analysis. However, function calls present a dilemma for UCSE: either explore the function thoroughly, incurring substantial overhead, or limit the exploration and risk overlooking crucial operations. Besides, UCSE is unable to process indirect calls when the destination of the call cannot be determined within the current code region. Employing function summaries is a solution to these challenges. Function summaries can simulate function behaviors and replace the UCSE in actual functions. Currently, symbolic execution tools only manually implement function summaries for limited libc functions, and research on the automated generation of function summaries for symbolic execution remains insufficient. In this paper, we propose Symerge, a new approach to generate function summaries for symbolic execution. We conduct UCSE within a function, assess differences between initial and return states, and summarize these differences to build a function summary. We employ multi-level state merging to manage states within a function, thereby preventing state explosion. State merging introduces complex expressions and increases the execution overhead. To mitigate this, we apply acceleration strategies such as expression simplification. Finally, we use information in function summaries to find vulnerabilities. The overall performance of Symerge on Juliet Test Suite outperforms that of the baseline tools. Symerge solves most indirect calls in 4 real-world binaries and finds 17 bugs, including four 0-day vulnerabilities.},

To counter this, we perform Windows ransomware static analysis and detection using reverse engineering and Ensemble Learning. We start by using Ghidra to perform reverse engineering, in which we automate both static analysis and compilation procedures to curate a dataset that represents ransomware of various kinds. To overcome the issue of limited ransomware samples and existing unrealistic data augmentation techniques, we apply the concept of differential privacy to create our own generative adversarial network. Critical features have been identified and processed through ensemble learning models. The experimental results show that the ensembles of Stacking Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest yielded a maximum accuracy of 97.51\% in detecting ransomware attacks.},

  abstract = {In the current era of mobile technology, Android’s widespread use and customisation by developers have also made it simpler for hackers to identify and exploit security flaws. Android malware continues to evolve, and one of the biggest concerns is how it quietly exploits app permissions and runs in the background to carry out harmful tasks without users even being aware of it. To address this emerging issue, the research proposes a static analysis-based solution for Android malware detection, utilising features derived from application permissions and API call behaviour. The study investigated a range of machine learning algorithms, including traditional methods such as Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, and KNN, as well as more advanced approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks and ensemble techniques like Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost. We trained and tested the models using a well-organised set of Android app datasets and then measured their performance by analysing the results with a confusion matrix, focusing on key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The confusion matrix clearly shows where our approach performs well, especially in real-world situations where there’s an uneven number of malicious and safe apps. Our results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods in enhancing mobile security while also providing a clear comparison of how different algorithms approach the task of detecting Android malware.},

  abstract = {Android is a popular target for malware attacks due to its open-source and open nature. However, machine learning-based malware detection systems are vulnerable to adversarial sample attacks. The generation of adversarial sample primarily focuses on methods such as adding API perturbations, redundant code, and permissions. Nevertheless, these attack methods suffer from improper execution and corruption of the original malicious functions. In this paper, we investigate malware adversarial techniques, design an algorithm (DERGB algorithm) for generating adversarial samples targeting Android malware, based on RGB images, and utilize the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to identify the pixels in the image that impact the classification results for perturbation. Our algorithm aims to minimize the number of pixels requiring perturbations. Additionally, we leverage the header information class.dex file features, which contain the data area offsets, to constrain the range of pixel modifications in the algorithm for adversarial sample generation. This ensures that the malicious functionality and executability of the adversarial sample software remain uncompromised. The Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm incurs a decrease in the accuracy of the detection model by approximately 34.8 \\(\\\%\\) when subjected to an attack by a single pixel point, and about 77.14 \\(\\\%\\) when subjected to five-pixel point attacks. These findings demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a comparable attack effect to other anti-sample attack algorithms, even with minimal perturbations.},

  abstract = {In the evolving landscape of mobile security threats, traditional detection methods often struggle to effectively identify and mitigate the risks posed by malicious APKs. This study introduces an integrated approach that combines the strengths of Snort and Wireshark with the dynamic response capabilities of Wazuh Manager. Initially, we leverage Snort’s robust network intrusion detection capabilities, enhanced through a custom plugin in Wireshark, to monitor and analyze APK file transfers. This setup allows for effective capture and initial screening of APKs based on known malicious signatures and anomalous network patterns. We then employed Wazuh Manager to facilitate an active response strategy. It automates the response to threats detected by Snort, for instance, isolating the affected systems, alerting administrators, and preventing the execution of suspicious APKs. This proactive approach not only aims to stop malware before it causes harm but also adaptively handles the evolving threat landscape by continuously updating detection rules and response strategies based on new intelligence. Our research indicates that an effective defense against malicious APKs involves monitoring, detecting, and actively responding to these threats. The integration of these tools provides a scalable and adaptable framework that can evolve with emerging threats, offering practical solutions for both organizational and individual security needs. This research investigates the potential of combining network and detection tools, which have been proven effective in computer settings, with active response systems. It establishes a foundation for future advancements in mobile security methodologies using a layered defense approach, making it highly relevant to the broader field of mobile internet security.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of network technology, malware has become an increasingly serious threat to network security. The Android platform has become the main target of malware attacks due to its openness and wide application. At the same time, the number and complexity of Android malware are increasing, which has a serious impact on user privacy protection, data security and normal operation of devices. The development of deep learning and computer vision technology has provided new ideas for Android malware detection, but the existing methods have certain limitations. On the one hand, relying solely on a single type of feature extraction is prone to information loss; on the other hand, the limitation on the size of feature images will further aggravate information loss, making it difficult to cope with the rapidly evolving Android malware. Therefore, this paper proposes an Android malware detection method (SAMD) based on multi-feature extraction and SPP-net. This method extracts API calls, permissions, and opcode sequence features from classes.dex, AndroidManifest.xml, and smali files, respectively, and generates corresponding feature grayscale images to fully retain the key information of Android malware. Then, the feature images are input into the classification model based on SPP-net for Android malware detection. Experimental results on the CIC MalDroid 2020 and Google Play Store datasets show that SAMD demonstrates good performance in the Android malware detection task, with an accuracy of 95.56\%.},

Overall, HarmonyOS 5.0 performs best, followed by Android 14. (2) We carefully select 1246 popular apps to view their actual usage of custom root certificates. 42\% of them have configuration issues with custom implementations, and some even enable HTTP communication, which indicates that while customizing root certificates provides convenience to users, it also introduces security risks. Finally, we evaluate the priority of root certificates from different sources to help users better understand the root certificates used by the current TLS connection. In general, both manufacturers and developers need to further improve their management and usage of root certificates.},

  abstract = {The extensive usage of the Internet and IoT is becoming common in day-to-day life. Advancements of technology and usage of mobile devices in diversified sectors are dominating. Data security is a challenging task when it is shared over Internet. Hackers are constantly posing new threats and introducing new malwares to steal the data, passwords, and vital information. Identification of malwares is essential in this regard. Converting portable executable files into images and applying machine learning and deep learning techniques for the classification of malware type are gaining popularity in the research community. Convolutional neural networks are extensively used in recent times. But they fail in capturing complex patterns in the images. Kolmogorov-Arnold networks are introduced as an alternative to convolutional neural networks as they are able to represent the images in a more discriminable manner. In this work, an algorithm is proposed using Kolmogorov-Arnold network for the classification of malware images. Extensive simulations are done on three malware datasets, viz., MaleVis, Malimg and Microsoft Big 2015. Promising results are obtained with the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks on the three datasets. Proposed algorithm is justified with suitable cross-validation strategies and the results are compared with the state-of-the-art works on similar datasets. Furthermore, a conglomerate dataset is formulated with all the three datasets comprising 60 classes. As all the datasets are imbalanced ones, suitable imbalance metrics, i.e., index balanced accuracy and geometric mean are used. Index balanced accuracies of 98.90, 90.4, 94.06, and 90.1\% are obtained on Malimg, MaleVis, Microsoft Big 2015 and Conglomerate datasets, respectively.},

  abstract = {Multimodal learning provides an effective approach for Android malware detection by integrating heterogeneous data sources such as permissions, intents, and binary content. However, existing fusion algorithms remain simplistic, lacking the capacity to model complex cross-modal relationships. This paper proposes a Large Language Model (LLM)-based feature fusion framework for Android malware classification. The framework combines tabular features (permissions and intents) and visual representations derived from DEX bytecode using a dual-stream architecture with Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones. A fusion head inspired by LLMs is employed to capture rich interactions across modalities. Experimental results on the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset show that LLM-based fusion using TinyLLaMA achieves 96.81\% accuracy in binary classification and 92.01\% in multi-class classification. Under adversarial conditions, the same model reaches 98.24\% and 55.74\% respectively, outperforming conventional strategies such as self-attention (38.29\%, 24.86\%) and concatenation (45.10\%, 25.87\%). Similarly, in obfuscation scenarios, LLM-based fusion (TinyLLaMA and CodeBERT) maintains robust performance, achieving up to 96.66\% binary accuracy and 92.83\% multi-class accuracy. These results demonstrate improved resilience of the proposed approach against obfuscation and adversarial manipulation .},

Smartphone users constantly search for apps that meet their needs, resulting in a flood of options in the marketplace. However, there is a growing concern regarding the security of Android applications, as many have shortcomings in addressing critical security aspects. One reason behind this issue often lies in the lack of automated mechanisms during the design and development stages to identify, test, and rectify vulnerabilities in the source code. It is crucial to address these issues proactively rather than relying solely on updates and patches for already published apps. In response to this challenge, researchers have proposed machine learning techniques to enhance application security by detecting vulnerabilities and malicious code within source code. This systematic literature review delves into this domain by examining 85 carefully selected technical studies published between 2017 and 2024. It aims to shed light on the strengths, weaknesses, and practical applicability of these techniques, while also identifying areas for further improvement. Moreover, the growing focus on advanced approaches—such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Explainable AI (XAI)—indicates a trend toward more transparent and context-aware vulnerability detection. By synthesizing key insights from the current literature, this review enhances our understanding of Android security approaches, identifies promising directions for future research, and ultimately contributes to the advancement of more secure mobile applications through machine learning-based vulnerability detection.},

Strong detection frameworks are needed to identify informative features and classify sophisticated malware behaviour precisely. Introduce a hybrid Android malware classifier model integrating generative transformer-based N-tuple contrastive learning for feature representation with a new Quantum Support Red Piranha Vector Regression (QSRPVR) method for accurate classification. The transformer part is able to learn deep semantic patterns, and the N-tuple contrastive learning strengthens feature discriminability and generalizability. The QSRPVR classifier utilizes quantum kernel estimation and Red Piranha optimization for the best feature selection and accurate regression. The method combines static and dynamic analysis for end-to-end behavioural profiling. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets, Drebin, AndroZoo, AMD, and VirusShare, prove the better performance of the model. The method proved to be 99.8\% accurate on Drebin and AndroZoo, and 99.78\% on AMD and VirusShare datasets. The system proves to be highly robust to obfuscation attacks and exhibits generalizability across malware variants.

  abstract = {Docker and WebAssembly (Wasm) are playing increasingly important roles in modern software development, each offering unique benefits in portability, performance, and deployment efficiency. As Wasm evolves beyond the browser into cloud-native and edge computing environments, its integration with container runtimes prompts a closer examination of performance trade-offs compared to traditional multi-platform containers. In contrast to conventional Docker containers, Wasm binaries offer a portable, compact, and secure deployment format. In this paper, we extend our prior investigation by introducing two new benchmark suites: benchx and sqlite-multiarch to explore deeper performance characteristics across Wasm and native multi-architecture containers using containerd , focusing on four platforms: AMD64 , ARM64 (Nvidia’s Jetson Nano and Orin), and RISCV64 (StarFive VisionFive2). We analyze pull time, startup latency, and image size across both native and Wasm runtimes. Our results show that Wasm containers reduce image size by up to \\(70\\\%\\) and achieve up to \\(25\\\%\\) faster cold pull times compared to native containers. With the sqlite-multiarch benchmark, we observe Wasm startup overheads compared to native execution, which highlights both performance gaps and opportunities for runtime optimizations. Across all platforms, Wasm containers executed via containerd consistently outperformed Docker-based setups. We demonstrate that Wasm runtimes can effectively support realistic data-intensive workloads such as full-text search, JSON parsing, and R-tree spatial queries, while offering improved deployment efficiency and better performance isolation. These findings reaffirm Wasm’s potential as a complementary compute layer for heterogeneous, multi-architecture cloud-edge deployments.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth in the number of malware apps poses a great danger to users of power mobile terminals. Among smart devices, devices using the Android system are very popular and thus are easy targets for malware attacks. In this paper, we propose a mobile terminal security protection method based on community detection algorithms and graph matching networks. First, the call relationships between functions are extracted from the decompiled APK files, and runtime information is collected as a supplement to complete the construction of the behavior graph. Second, based on the behavior graph of malware samples, we propose a method to extract the public behavior graph as the features of malware families. Finally, a graph matching network is used to learn and calculate the similarity between the public behavior graph and the software behavior graph, and use it as the basis for detection. Our evaluation of the dataset containing 1274 malware apps and 108 benign apps shows that the selected public behavior graph is effective for Android malware detection, with an overall accuracy of 90.4\%. The experimental results show that the method has a high detection rate and a low false rate, and can detect malware and its variants.},

As one of the most popular operating systems, Android is a prime target for security attacks. Only in 2019, 10.5 million malware was detected. Recursive neural networks are in essence machine models made up of a list of cells. Their particularity is that part of the output of the previous cell is used as input for the next one. LSTM have shown good results in several areas, for example, text generation, translation, trajectory prediction. Among the recursive neural network models, LSTM is one of the most efficient approaches to sequence classification as it is able to make relations between very distant elements in a sequence. This research explored the application of LSTM for Android malware detection using source code decompiled from the Android Application Package (APK). The approach we have tried is to first extract the instructions from the source code while respecting their execution order as much as possible. We then explored several ways to filter and encode these instructions. For all feature sets we created, we obtained an accuracy greater than 70 \\(\\\%\\) of accuracy and for some feature sets the accuracy reached 83 \\(\\\%\\) showing that it is possible to successfully detect malware using source code and LSTM.},

In this paper, we extend our previous research work titled “Anatomizing Android Malwares” [ 20 ] and bring forward a novel method of identifying malicious android apps using object-oriented software metrics and supervised machine learning techniques. Initially, we retrieve object-oriented software metrics from the decompiled android app, and then this metrics tuple is tagged either as benign or malware using VirusTotal service. Finally, the set of metrics tuple acts as input features in machine learning algorithms. We evaluated the performance and stability of our forty-eight different machine-learned models against 5774 android apps collected from AndroZoo [ 1 ]. The discriminatory power of every machine-learned model is measured using its area under ROC curve (AUC), accuracy and F -measure values.

  abstract = {Smart contracts, known for their immutable nature to ensure trust via automated enforcement, have evolved to necessitate upgradeability due to unforeseen vulnerabilities and the need for feature enhancements post-deployment. This inherent contradiction between immutability and the necessity for modifications has prompted the development of upgradeable smart contracts. These contracts are immutable in principle yet upgradeable by design, allowing for future updates without altering the underlying data or state, thus preserving the contract’s original intent while accommodating necessary improvements. This empirical study aims to bridge the gap in understanding the practical application and implications of upgradeable smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By introducing a comprehensive dataset that catalogs the versions and evolutionary trajectories of smart contracts, the research explores several key dimensions: the prevalence and adoption patterns of upgrade mechanisms, the likelihood and actual occurrences of contract upgrades, the nature of modifications post-upgrade, and their impact on user engagement and contract activity. Through a detailed empirical analysis, this study systematically identifies upgradeable contracts and examines their upgrade history to uncover trends, preferences, and the practical challenges associated with applying such modifications. The empirical evidence gathered from the analysis of over 44 million contracts shows that a mere 3\% embody upgradeable characteristics, with only 0.34\% of the 3\% undergoing subsequent upgrades. This finding underscores a cautious approach by developers towards contract modifications, possibly due to the complexity of upgrade processes or a preference for maintaining the original contract stability. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that upgrades are predominantly aimed at feature enhancement and vulnerability mitigation, particularly when the contracts’ source codes are accessible. However, the relationship between contract upgrades and user activity is intricate, suggesting that additional factors significantly affect the utilization of smart contracts beyond their mere functional evolution.},

  abstract = {Mobile apps are predominantly integrated with cloud services to benefit from enhanced functionalities. Adopting authentication using secrets such as API keys is crucial to ensure secure mobile-cloud interactions. However, developers often overlook the proper storage of such secrets, opting to put them directly into their projects. These secrets are checked into the projects and can be easily extracted and exploited by malicious adversaries. While many researchers investigated the issue of checked-in secret in open-source projects, there is a notable research gap concerning checked-in secrets in Android apps deployed on platforms such as Google Play Store. Unlike open-source projects, the lack of direct access to the source code and the presence of obfuscation complicates the checked-in secret detection for Android apps. This motivates us to conduct an empirical analysis to measure and compare the performance of different checked-in secret detection tools on Android apps. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify existing checked-in secret detection tools and then analyzed how these tools could be adapted and applied to the context of Android apps. Then, we evaluated three representative tools: Three-Layer Filter, LeakScope, and PassFinder on 5,135 Android apps, comparing their performance and analyzing their limitations. Our experiment reveals 2,142 checked-in secrets affecting 2,115 Android apps and also discloses that the current checked-in secret detection techniques suffer from key limitations. While all the tools achieved high precision, each of them can miss a significant number of checked-in secrets in Android apps. Nevertheless, we observed that the tools are complimentary, suggesting the possibility of developing a more effective checked-in secret detection tool by combining their insights. Additionally, we outline potential directions for future research, supported by preliminary experimental results.},

To address these issues, AI-based forensic tools are crucial for investigating security incidents, but their accuracy depends on high-quality mobile malware datasets. While dynamic analysis has limitations, recent research has shifted towards static analysis and AI-based methods for malware detection. However, there are three key challenges: lack of reproducibility, low dataset quality, and bias in AI datasets. This paper focuses on an overlooked bias—the incorrect API Level distribution in malware datasets. Such bias skews AI detection results, making them appear effective in tests but less applicable in real-world scenarios. To highlight the importance of dataset quality, three case studies on API Level Analysis were conducted, showing how biased datasets can distort detection results. To address this, the paper introduces methods and terms like Delayed Interception, Dataset of guaranteed quality, API Milestones, AndroBank, and Sample Unification, which aim to enhance dataset reliability and improve AI-based mobile malware detection.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts are self-executing programs on blockchains, critical for enabling efficient, secure, and reliable data exchange and value transfer. However, as their application scenarios expand, reliability issues have become a major bottleneck for blockchain development. Existing vulnerability detection methods often model smart contract source code as graph structures and use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature learning. Yet these methods over-rely on static execution flow features and ignore dynamic behavioral information of contract accounts in real runtime environments, limiting their ability to capture dynamic patterns and semantic details of contracts. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a graph attention network vulnerability detection model with global feature augmentation for smart contracts (GaGAT). Specifically, we first model key functions and variables in the contract source code as nodes, and execution flows as edges to construct a base contract graph. Then, we innovatively introduce global virtual nodes that integrate two types of information: contract categories and contract account behavioral features, including balance changes, Ether inflow/outflow, daily transaction frequency and single transaction duration. After contract graph contraction and feature transformation, we generate a feature matrix as input to the GaGAT model. Subsequently, we conduct vulnerability detection. Through a series of experiments, we provide empirical evidence of the superior performance of our proposed method compared to existing approaches in detecting six different categories of vulnerabilities.This study provides a new paradigm for cross-modal feature fusion for smart contract security analysis.},

  abstract = {Binary code analysis plays a pivotal role in the field of software security and is widely used in tasks such as software maintenance, malware detection, software vulnerability discovery, patch analysis, etc. However, unlike source code, reverse engineers face significant challenges in understanding binary code due to the lack of intuitive semantic information. Although traditional reverse tools can convert binary code into C-like pseudo code, the lack of code comments and symbolic information such as function names still makes code understanding difficult. In recent years, two groups of techniques have shown promising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based techniques have demonstrated competitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore, (2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the source-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation. This has left participants wondering about the capabilities of LLMs in binary code understanding. To this end, this work proposes a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios, which covers two key binary code understanding tasks, i.e., function name recovery and binary code summarization. To more comprehensively evaluate, we include binaries with multiple target architectures as well as different optimization options. We gain valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations through extensive empirical studies of popular LLMs using our benchmark. Our evaluations reveal that existing LLMs can understand binary code to a certain extent, thereby improving the efficiency of binary code analysis. Our results highlight the great potential of the LLMs in advancing the field of binary code understanding, and provide new directions for binary code analysis techniques.},

This work takes a crucial step towards demystifying Android adware.

We identify adware family payloads by isolating packages from samples for VirusTotal rescanning, unveiling distinctive patterns in family naming conventions, and exposing the misclassification of legitimate ad networks as adware. Our analysis of payload location strategies reveals that over 30\% of adware families employ payloads beyond conventional Java/Kotlin code. Based on our dataset analysis, we conducted a comprehensive Adware Characterization of 92 distinct adware families, revealing diverse implementation patterns and evolving techniques across the mobile ecosystem. To facilitate this analysis, we developed an Adware Characterization Schema that provided a structured taxonomy for systematically classifying the observed behaviors. Our investigation uncovered multiple categories of fraudulent activities, including aggressive ad display techniques, sophisticated click fraud implementations, privacy information leakage, malicious promotion mechanisms, and various persistence and evasion mechanisms employed to avoid detection while maximizing illicit revenue. This research establishes foundations for comprehending the fraudulent and adversarial techniques within the mobile adware landscape and facilitates the development of more robust detection mechanisms against these evolving threats.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an iterative method for extracting algorithms from binary code and constructing their high-level representation. The construction of algorithms by using the proposed method is implemented as an analysis of dynamic slices. The method is based on an algorithm for data flow tracking in forward and backward directions. Two levels of representation of the extracted algorithms are proposed: a slice functional diagram and an algorithm execution diagram. The slice functional diagram is a structured slice representation; as compared to the algorithm execution diagram, it is a lower-level representation. The algorithm execution diagram is a representation that consists only of function summaries and function parameters. The proposed method for constructing algorithms and methods for their representation make it possible to increase the analyst’s productivity in solving problems of code security analysis, as well as improve the quality of the results. The developed algorithm representation methods can be used to implement algorithms for automated code security analysis. In addition, the paper overviews some other approaches to extraction of algorithms from binary code and considers their representations in static analysis tools, including some of their flaws and limitations.},

It helps developers mitigate the legal and security risks associated with OSS, ensuring safer and more reliable software. Traditional SCA methods often require users to upload their source code to an SCA server for inspection, which then generates reports on component usage. However, vendors have significant concerns about this approach because source code often includes sensitive information like proprietary algorithms, core business logic, and confidential user data. To address these challenges, various SCA techniques, such as binary-binary SCA and binary-source SCA, have been proposed, though most are limited to specific programming languages. Existing SCA frameworks primarily focus on C/C + + and Java. This paper introduces the first binary-source SCA method capable of analyzing three binary types across five programming languages (C/C + + , Objective-C, Swift, Go). Our approach utilizes BM25-based text tokens, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining detection performance. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves up to 81.4\% recall in identifying reused OSS components, providing an efficient and scalable solution for secure software development.

  abstract = {Mobile malware has become one of the most critical security threats in the era of ubiquitous mobile computing. Despite the intensive efforts from security experts to counteract it, recent years have still witnessed a rapid growth of identified malware samples. This could be partly attributed to the newly-emerged technologies that may constantly open up under-studied attack surfaces for adversaries. One typical example is the recently-developed mobile machine learning (ML) framework that enables storing and running deep learning (DL) models on mobile devices. Despite obvious advantages, this new feature also inadvertently introduces potential vulnerabilities (e.g., on-device models may be modified for malicious purposes). In this work, we propose a method to generate or transform mobile malware by hiding malicious payloads inside DL models’ parameters based on a strategy considering four factors (layer type, layer number, layer coverage, and the number of bytes to replace). Utilizing the proposed method, we can run malware in DL mobile applications covertly with little impact on the model performance (i.e., as little as 0.35\% drop in accuracy and at most 39ms latency overhead). We can successfully trigger malicious functions, such as getting SMS records and screenshots in a real-world application. The generated malware can evade state-of-the-art detection techniques (i.e., none detected by VirusTotal), and the malware-based attack exhibits high practical feasibility (i.e., successfully attack 41\% of the apps with on-device DL models). Our work should alert security experts on malware injection attacks on mobile devices, and further raise more awareness towards the deep-learning-assisted attacks in the mobile ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Detection of malware is an important problem to be addressed in the realm of computer and network security. Malware writers are becoming increasingly competent at creating new versions of malware at a lightning-fast speed using various kinds of obfuscation mechanisms. These new generation malware are so complex that a straightforward simplistic method like the one based on malware signatures can no longer be used for detecting them. Therefore, we need heuristics-based methods that use machine learning and deep learning techniques for learning what features in a file make it malicious or benign. The ML/DL algorithms can do this because they are trained on a huge amount of data. These techniques can further be categorized as static and dynamic malware detection techniques. In this article, we have briefly explored basic malware concepts, various types of malware, malware evasion mechanisms and existing popular malware datasets used in malware detection research. Then we discuss at length, the various types of malware detection approaches using machine learning as well as deep learning by organizing the methods into eight ’novel’ categories based on the kind of input features the methods operate upon. Such a categorization has not been done previously to the best of our knowledge. The discussion also includes a critical analysis of the various methods under each category including insights obtained by cross comparison, strengths/weaknesses of each method as well as the various limitations and challenges. The article also includes current challenges in malware detection like code obfuscation, adversarial attacks, real-time detection, concept drift and evolving malware, explainability and trust in ML/DL models and various areas for futuristic research endeavors like anomaly detection based malware detection, enhancing adversarial robustness of the models, employing attention mechanisms, explainable malware detection, detection of hibernating malware.},

  abstract = {The ubiquity of Android devices has made them a prime target for malicious activities, ranging from traditional malware to sophisticated colluding apps. Colluding apps collaborate to exploit permissions and thereby pose significant security risks. The development of advanced detection methodologies targeting the app collusions involve complications as: (i) they constantly evolve; (ii) the relevant samples are lesser in numbers; and (iii) the available datasets are limited to the most prominent and familiar ways leaving few significant ones. Considering the same, in this paper, we aim to fill this void by creating a new dataset named “CADDroid” that focuses on AIDL, Unix Socket, Sticky Broadcast, and WebView. We believe that this dataset can be utilized to train/develop modern detection methodologies targeting them. To realize this, we have manually created 76 app pairs that exhibit collusion which include 24, 24, 26, and 2 app pairs exploiting AIDL, Unix Socket, Sticky Broadcast, and WebView respectively. As the created apps can extract 31 distinct types of sensitive information, we have also validated them by installing them on devices with various Android versions. Furthermore, on scanning the developed apps with VirusTotal and FlowDroid, we have noticed that they have not exposed any of the exhibited colluding behaviours. This highlights the capability of CADDroid in the current scenario and the potential of it to be considered for the development of modern malware detection methodologies. Besides, we have also discussed the potential attack vector space of the proposed work in real-life scenario.},

  abstract = {Abstract The pervasive use of mobile applications and social networks has intensified privacy concerns due to the widespread collection, processing, and sharing of personal data. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeMountain , a novel AI-driven framework designed to systematically quantify, evaluate, and visualize privacy risks in mobile apps and social platforms, ensuring strict compliance with international regulations, particularly the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). SafeMountain combines static and dynamic code analyses to scrutinize real-world data handling practices and detect potential privacy breaches. It also employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for automated interpretation and evaluation of privacy policies and Terms of Service. By mapping textual policy disclosures to actual app permissions and behaviors, it identifies discrepancies and highlights potential non-compliance and data misuse. The framework introduces an objective risk scoring mechanism aligned with international standards and regulatory requirements, offering a structured methodology to classify and visualize privacy risks. This risk assessment spans multiple dimensions (predictability, manageability, and disassociability) leveraging privacy engineering principles and regulatory risk factors, and uses an intuitive traffic-light system (Green, Yellow, Red) to enhance transparency and user comprehension. SafeMountain addresses major research gaps, notably the absence of standardized privacy risk scoring and comprehensive visualization tools. By delivering actionable insights into permission consistency, policy transparency, compliance gaps, and data leakage vulnerabilities, it empowers users, developers, and organizations to manage privacy risks proactively. Ultimately, SafeMountain fosters trust through more transparent and accountable data privacy practices across digital ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Mare exploits systems intending to disrupt operations or compromise sensitive data, and it represents an extensive and dynamic threat landscape. Effectiveness across platforalwms, generalization, and adaptability are frequently challenges for traditional malware detection techniques, particularly when dealing with emerging malware varieties. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a Hybrid Stacking-based Ensemble Framework for Malware Detection (HSEF-MD) that covers three significant gaps in prior research: limited integration of dynamic analysis, insufficient cross-platform feature integration, and insufficient training data. HSEF-MD builds a strong training basis through acquiring and combining sizable static and dynamic datasets from the Windows and Android platforms. HSEF-MD aims to enhance overall accuracy by addressing concept drift, minimizing data imbalance, improving model interpretability, and reducing the false positive rate (FPR). A number of research studies, comprising three different trials, show that incorporating dynamic analysis into the training phase considerably improves model performance. Evaluation measures, including F1 score, ROC-AUC, accuracy, precision, and FPR, confirm the efficiency and supremacy of the HSEF-MD over conventional models. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic feature integration and cross-platform fusion are to building robust malware detection systems. Notably, the HSEF-MD demonstrates robustness in cross-platform scenarios, such as training on dynamic features and validating on static features, offering practical cost advantages with minimal performance compromise.},

This paper offers a panoramic survey of AES, from its historical foundations and architecture through an exploration of its Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN) design, mathematical foundations in Galois Field arithmetic, and evolution since NIST’s public competition that selected Rijndael. Emphasis is placed on the algorithm’s resistance to classical cryptanalysis such as differential and linear attacks while recognizing that side-channel threats, including power analysis and timing leakage, can undermine even robust ciphers if implementations are flawed. Practical implementations and real-world applications are examined across software libraries, specialized hardware accelerators like Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and lightweight adaptations for constrained environments, illustrating how factors such as performance, cost, and energy consumption must be balanced against potential vulnerabilities. Subsequently, we compare AES with alternative block and stream ciphers (e.g., 3DES, ChaCha20), underscoring AES’s continuing dominance in both regulated industries and modern cryptographic protocols. Key management emerges as a linchpin, where flawed lifecycle practices or insecure key storage can jeopardize AES’s theoretical security. Finally, the paper addresses looming challenges, chief among them the advent of quantum computing, which motivates hybrid cryptographic schemes that combine AES with post-quantum algorithms. By highlighting cutting-edge research on side-channel mitigations, post-quantum integration, and advanced masking techniques, this survey reaffirms AES’s pre-eminence while mapping out the critical avenues of innovation needed to preserve its resilience in an evolving threat landscape.},

  abstract = {Abstract Android malware is the major cyber threat to the popular Android platform which may influence millions of end users. To battle against the Android malware, a large number of machine learning methods either based on 1) traditional feature extraction using static and dynamic analysis, or 2) recently proposed image representations, have been developed, and have achieved promising results. However, the vast majority of the existing work rely on a large number of labeled samples which are unfortunately not available for the newly reported Android malware families. This poses a critical challenge to detect such few-shot Android malware families . In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning approach based on the image representation of an Android application to solve the problem. With an application file converted into an image representation, we preserve all the source code information. We then utilize self-supervised learning to obtain the pre-trained backbone from the unlabeled auxiliary data and employ a metric-based few-shot learning method for Android malware classification. Considering the impact of irrelevant information across samples on the family classification, we employ a multi-cropping strategy to capture family label-related information in the images. Extensive experimental results on the popular CICInvesAndMal2019 dataset confirm the effectiveness of our approach in detecting few-shot Android malware families. We achieve at least 3.16\% and 3.7\% improvement on 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot scenarios respectively comparing to state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract = {Abstract To facilitate collaboration across multiple devices and benefit from larger screens and better user experiences, many users choose to mirror their screen content of smartphones to personal computers. The implementation of the Android screen mirroring feature varies across different manufacturers, resulting in significant security differences among screen mirroring apps. Moreover, actual incidents of screen content leakage have exacerbated users’ concerns about the security of the Android screen mirroring feature. In this work, we systematically analyzed the system architecture of the Android screen mirroring feature and the security risks it faces. Specifically, we identified four critical security risks in the communication process between the mobile and PC sides of screen mirroring apps, including arbitrary access to screen content, MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks, malicious commands injection, and data sniffing attacks. Attackers can exploit these identified security risks to arbitrarily access screen content or manipulate user’s phone to perform malicious operations. To evaluate the security risks of the Android mirroring feature in real-world deployments, we conducted a security evaluation on over 20 popular screen mirroring apps from multiple sources. The results indicate that all of these apps are facing at least one of the aforementioned security risks. Finally, we provide the corresponding recommendations to mitigate the identified security risks.},

Researchers have begun using deep learning (DL) algorithms for malware detection, according to current research. Presented a DL model that combines Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) model as the basis for an algorithm for Android malware detection. Start by taking a look at the Android virus; not only will static characteristics be extracted, but dynamic behavioral elements with good anti obfuscation ability will as well. The TCN is implemented for processing the static characteristics due to their relative independence. When processing a series of dynamic features, the gate recurrent unit (GRU) is used because of the features’ temporal correlation. Hence, Understandable Artificial Intelligence- Android Malware Detection -Deep Learning (XAI-AMD-DL), a hybrid Android malware detection system employing DL models, is proposed in this research. It combines XAI with TCNs and finally classified using Logistic Twin based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Test the suggested model via the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset.

The survey highlights key applications in areas such as malware detection, network traffic analysis, phishing detection, threat actor attribution, and social engineering defense. We also explore critical challenges in deploying GenAI, including data privacy, security concerns, and the need for interpretable and transparent models. As regulations like the European Commission’s AI Act emerge, ensuring trustworthy AI solutions is becoming more crucial. Real-world case studies, such as the impact of the WannaCry ransomware, the rise of deepfakes, and AI-driven social engineering, demonstrate both the potential and current limitations of GenAI in CTI. Our goal is to provide foundational insights and strategic direction for advancing GenAI’s role in future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing the importance of innovation, adaptability, and ongoing learning to enhance resilience against evolving cyber threats.

Existing static analysis tools provide limited detection capabilities and struggle with complex vulnerabilities.

The framework employs a three-step methodology: (i) feature extraction from control flow graphs (CFGs) and abstract syntax trees (ASTs), leveraging multiple fuzzing analyzers for data labeling; (ii) training a hybrid ensemble model combining bagging with Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithms, including GBM, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost; and (iii) detecting vulnerabilities through classification tasks, with final predictions determined by a majority-voting mechanism across class probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the BGBDT-CG model, achieving 98\% detection accuracy and an average F1 score of 95.2\%, outperforming existing methods. The integration of bagging and CatBoost proved particularly effective, highlighting the framework's robustness and reliability in smart contract vulnerability detection.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach for automated detection and security analysis of payment libraries in Android applications. Our tool, PayScan, employs byte-pattern analysis and heuristic scanning techniques to identify TPLs and then it assesses their security posture. Additionally, the tool integrates three independent security scanners. We analyzed a dataset of 10,553 Android applications, detecting 18 payment libraries and evaluating their security and privacy risks. Our findings indicate that 71.7\% of applications use outdated payment libraries, with some SDK versions being over four years old. Additionally, we identified 397 private key leaks across 212 applications. The security scanners detected over 20,000 vulnerabilities, including critical issues such as SSL misconfigurations, WebView XSS, and weak cryptographic implementations. We compare our detection approach against LibScout and LibRadar, demonstrating its practical performance in detecting payment libraries, including in obfuscated applications. This study reveals important security risks in mobile payment ecosystems and emphasizes the value of continued monitoring of third-party payment libraries. The proposed tool offers a scalable solution for detection and analysis, providing practical utility for researchers, developers, and auditors focused on financial application security.},

  abstract = {Abstract Binary analysis, the process of examining software without its source code, plays a crucial role in understanding program behavior, e.g., evaluating the security properties of commercial software, and analyzing malware. One challenging aspect of this process is to classify data encoding schemes, such as encryption and compression, due to the absence of high-level semantic information. Existing approaches either rely on code similarity, which only works for known schemes, or heuristic rules, which lack scalability. In this paper, we propose DESCG , a novel deep learning-based method for automatically classifying four widely employed kinds of data encoding schemes in binary programs: encryption, compression, decompression, and hashing. Our approach leverages dynamic analysis to extract execution traces from binary programs, builds data dependency graphs from these traces, and incorporates critical feature engineering. By combining the specialized graph representation with the Graph Neural Network (GNN), our approach enables accurate classification without requiring prior knowledge of specific encoding schemes. The Evaluation result shows that DESCG achieves 97.7\% accuracy and an F1 score of 97.67\%, outperforming baseline models. We also conducted an extensive evaluation of DESCG to explore which feature is more important for it and examine its performance and overhead.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts are computer programs deployed on blockchains to facilitate transactions. A critical aspect of smart contract security is the use of state-reverting statements (e.g., require , if...revert , if...throw ). These statements protect transactions from abnormal behaviors or malicious attacks by reverting a contract to its previous state when certain input constraints or security properties are violated. While essential, the correct use of these state-reverting (SR) statements is nontrivial. Improper use can lead to security vulnerabilities, resulting in substantial financial losses or other severe consequences. It is, therefore, highly important to understand developers’ practices of state reverting in smart contracts and the common mistakes they make. To achieve this goal, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study on the use of SR statements and their related faults in Solidity smart contracts. First, we analyze the prevalence and purposes of SR statements in 21,414 verified contracts from popular decentralized applications (dapps) and manually examine 381 SR statements, leading to a taxonomy of their uses. Second, we collect 320 real-world state-reverting faults (SR faults) from open-source projects on GitHub and audit reports on Code4rena. We categorize the SR faults into 17 types and summarize 12 distinct fixing strategies. This knowledge can help researchers and practitioners to better understand the common usages of SR statements and learn how to prevent or cope with SR faults. Lastly, the variety of SR fault types and the presence of high-risk issues highlight the need for automated tools to identify and mitigate these faults. This further motivates us to assess the SR fault detection performance of state-of-the-art security analyzers, with the aim of understanding their capability and identifying their deficiencies. Via evaluating 12 representative tools on a benchmark comprising 243 contracts with six types of SR faults and the corresponding patched versions, we observe that existing tools exhibit limited capabilities in detecting SR faults (the average detection rate is 14.4\%). This result underscores the need for more advanced security analysis tools specifically tailored for SR faults. To facilitate the development of such tools, we further provide a comprehensive analysis of three common limitations of existing tools.},

  abstract = {Abstract In recent years, the evolving browser fingerprinting technology has posed significant challenges and constant demands on detection methods. Research related to malicious code shows that cross-file techniques, which disperse code into multiple files, can resist current detection methods. To address this challenge, we introduce cross-file tracking technology into browser fingerprinting, constructing cross-file browser fingerprinting (XFP). The dispersion of files and features in XFP effectively circumvents detection methods that primarily focus on single-file tracking. In this paper, we propose XFP-Recognizer, a Random Forest-based detection method for identifying XFP behaviors. XFP-Recognizer aggregates code files and dynamic APIs by constructing function call relationship graphs (FCRgraphs). It extracts dynamic and static features to train random forest models for detecting and classifying the aggregated files, and then backtracks based on FCRgraphs to mark original scripts. To validate our method, we implement a code-splitting algorithm and constructed a cross-file tracking dataset to address the lack of XFP in real-world scenarios. We combine this dataset with the dataset of Alexa Top-10K websites in different proportions to verify the effectiveness of XFP-Recognizer. The results show that XFP-Recognizer achieved an Accuracy of 92.25\%, a Precision of 97.01\% and an AUC of 0.9152 in recognizing browser fingerprinting, demonstrating superior performance in both single-file and cross-file tracking. XFP-Recognizer complements existing detection methods, and the constructed split dataset also serves as a foundational resource for future research.},

In this paper, we performed a systematic literature review to identify studies on mobile app security in developing countries. We identified 25 primary studies and analysed the existing research directions taken, the different security concerns addressed, and the techniques used by researchers to highlight or address app security issues. Our main findings are: (1) the literature includes only a few studies on mobile app security in the context of developing countries (only 25 publications found); (2) among the different security concerns that researchers study, vulnerability detection appears to be the leading research topic; and (3) FinTech apps are revealed as the main target in the relevant literature. Overall, our work highlights that there is largely room for developing further specialized techniques addressing mobile app security in the context of developing countries.},

  abstract = {Cyber attacks and malware incidents have surged in prevalence, posing significant risks across various system domains. As a result, the development of automated machine learning techniques for robust malware defense has become increasingly vital. Among the prominent methodologies, two deep learning architectures for malware detection stand out: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) and Stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (SBiLSTM). These language models are engineered by parsing both malicious and benign Portable Executable (PE) files, specifically focusing on the.text segment which contains assembly instructions. Each instruction is treated as a discrete phrase, with the.text segments considered as individual documents. The categorization process classifies each phrase as either safe or vulnerable based on the underlying data source. This approach led to the creation of three distinct datasets. The first dataset comprises complete documents, which are analyzed using an SBiLSTM-based Document Level Analysis framework. The second dataset is constructed from individual sentences, which are processed through SBiLSTM Sentence Level Analysis mechanisms. Additionally, both the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) model and the General Language Model (GLM) based on GPT-3 are employed for enhanced contextual understanding. Ultimately, a pre-trained model is proposed, leveraging a dataset enriched with unlabeled assembly instructions. The efficacy of this malware detection framework is benchmarked against leading-edge research in the field. Notably, the detection performance of the GPT-3 integrated mechanism has shown substantial improvement, underscoring its potential as a formidable tool in the ongoing battle against malware threats.},

These attack campaigns are sophisticated and complex enough to get easily detected, specially in the Linux environment on which most of the back-end technologies and super computers are based. There is no proper solution to detect and predict these sophisticated attack campaign. This article presents a novel machine learning approach that utilizes the FastText embedding with support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for rapid and systematic APT attack detection and prediction. The dataset used in the study is developed by simulating several latest APTs and executing payloads in the Linux environment to effectively analyse, detect and predict the campaign. As per the APT life cycle, there are different stages and each stage has different characteristics and paths to observe, which are taken into consideration in the selected dataset. Utilizing the proposed methodology, there are four ML-model which are trained and tested against the accuracy. The maximum predicted accuracy of 96\% has been achieved for SVM. The results are compared with other machine learning models on same dataset as well. The experiment shows that SVM has performed significantly better in comparison to the other proposed models.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, Advanced persistent threats (APT) attacks are not only increasing in number but also becoming more sophisticated, posing serious challenges for organizations in detecting and preventing these threats. Some approaches for detecting APT attacks based on network traffic analysis using artificial intelligence have initially brought many positive results. The trend of these studies often seeks to analyze and extract network flow information in network traffic to find unusual behaviors of APT attacks. However, these approaches still have certain disadvantages that limit detection results, including: i) Only process data sequentially, lack flexibility and do not filter and focus on important data; ii) the context in the data has not been defined and evaluated. Although this is important information, it is closely related and interdependent with abnormal signs. To overcome the above limitations, this study introduces an advanced learning ensemble, combining modern techniques such as Adaptive contextual (AC), Selective adversarial generation (SAG), BiLSTM (Bidirectional long short-term memory), and Transformer. The AC technique is used to adapt to different network traffic data, helping to distill important information and adapt itself to data with different numbers of attacks, demonstrating context preservation and detecting anomalous patterns. SAG is applied to create synthetic data to simulate hacker attack data, helping to balance and improve the learning ability of the model. BiLSTM and Transformer are integrated to exploit contextual relationships and long-term dependencies in data, enhancing data processing capabilities based on parallel computing and analysis techniques. Experimental results in the article show that the proposed model is 2–4\% more effective than other studies on all measures. The experimental results of the study show that the proposed ACG-BT model has achieved an accuracy of up to 99.45\% and an F1-score of 98.35\% on a data set of 1,884 IP pairs extracted from more than 1.6 million flows. These figures demonstrate the model’s superior performance compared to existing methods, with improvements ranging from 2 to 4\% across all metrics.},

To address this problem, we have proposed an API names reconstruction method and have developed a feature selection approach that leverages the weights of these reconstructed names. Following this, we constructed a TextCNN-based Android malware detection model. To validate the robustness of our method against API changes, we conducted a series of cross-validation experiments using samples from different years. Comparison test also has been conducted, demonstrating that our detection method achieves superior performance.},

  abstract = {Virtual sculpting has evolved significantly, yet existing tools often neglect material physics and haptic rendering critical for realism. This paper presents a real-time immersive sculpting system that integrates material point method (MPM)-based elastoplastic material simulation with haptic rendering. To model the complex elastoplastic behaviors and the seamless interactions with tools within the MPM framework, we address this limitation by introducing a deformation-aware function that dynamically adjusts PK1 stress computation. It enables a seamless shift from elasticity to plasticity in the material. And for the realistic haptic feedback, we proposed a novel three-degree-of-freedom haptic rendering algorithm by solving a nonlinear least-squares problem. Additionally, to alleviate the visual artifacts of the marching cubes approach for surface reconstruction during cutting operations, we proposed a dual-field marching cubes algorithm that maintains topological consistency through adaptive isosurface blending. The experiments demonstrate real-time performance (78.4 FPS at 104k particles) and superior penetration resistance compared to the traditional MPM approach. A user study with 32 participants revealed significantly lower cognitive load (NASA-TLX, \\(p<0.05\\) ) and higher usability (SUS, \\(p<0.05\\) ), with haptic force correlating strongly (r=0.983) with real-world sculpting forces. The proposed framework advances immersive sculpting by unifying physical accuracy, haptic realism, and computational efficiency.},

  abstract = {The need to account for native code in Android apps is becoming urgent as the usage of native code is growing in both benign and malicious apps. However, most current state-of-the-art analysis tools cannot effectively analyze the data-flow behavior of native code. On the one hand, existing native dynamic analysis tools are primarily based on test input generation tools to analyze Android apps and are therefore unable to locate native code quickly. On the other hand, existing native static analysis tools are based on symbolic execution to analyze native code and are therefore limited by the path and state explosion issues. In order to effectively analyze the behavior of sensitive data in the native code, we first propose JNFuzz , a fuzzing module for Android native libraries based on Client/Server architecture. Then, we propose JNFuzz-Droid , a lightweight automated fuzzing and taint analysis framework for Android native code, based on this. JNFuzz-Droid first locates the Android native code to which sensitive data is passed and then uses JNFuzz to fuzz the native code to improve code coverage while analyzing the data flow in native code with a dynamic binary tool. Experimental results on benchmarks and real-world apps show that JNFuzz-Droid can effectively detect the leakage or transfer of sensitive data in app native code and outperforms the state-of-the-art native analysis tools.},

Understanding the relationship between TV and mobile apps is key to building consistent, secure, and optimized cross-platform experiences while addressing TV-specific SDK challenges. Despite extensive research on mobile apps, TV apps have been given little attention, leaving the relationship between phone and TV apps unexplored. Our study addresses this gap by compiling an extensive collection of 3445 Android phone/TV app pairs from the Google Play Store, launching the first comparative analysis of its kind. We examined these pairs across multiple dimensions, including non-code elements, code structure, security, and privacy aspects. Our findings reveal that while these app pairs could get identified with the same package names, they deploy different artifacts with varying functionality across platforms. TV apps generally exhibit less complexity in terms of hardware-dependent features and code volume but maintain significant shared resource files and components with their phone versions. Interestingly, some categories of TV apps show similar or even severe security and privacy concerns compared to their mobile counterparts. This research aims to assist developers and researchers in understanding phone-TV app relationships, highlight domain-specific concerns necessitating TV-specific tools, and provide insights for migrating apps from mobile to TV platforms.},

  abstract = {Binary analysis, as an important foundational technology, provides support for numerous applications in the fields of software engineering and security research. With the continuous expansion of software scale and the complex evolution of software architecture, binary analysis technology is facing new challenges. To break through existing bottlenecks, researchers have applied artificial intelligence (AI) technology to the understanding and analysis of binary code. The core lies in characterizing binary code, i.e., how to use intelligent methods to generate representation vectors containing semantic information for binary code, and apply them to multiple downstream tasks of binary analysis. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in binary code representation technology, and introduce the workflow of existing research in two parts, i.e., binary code feature selection methods and binary code feature embedding methods. The feature selection section includes mainly two parts: definition and classification of features, and feature construction. First, the abstract definition and classification of features are systematically explained, and second, the process of constructing specific representations of features is introduced in detail. In the feature embedding section, based on the different intelligent semantic understanding models used, the embedding methods are classified into four categories based on the usage of text-embedding models and graph-embedding models. Finally, we summarize the overall development of existing research and provide prospects for some potential research directions related to binary code representation technology.},

  abstract = {Abstract The defense of malware remains an important research hotspot in the field of cyberspace security. Recognizing its profound research significance, our defense against malware is still an important research hotspot in the field of cyberspace security. According to several recent surveys, global infrastructure is increasingly attacked by cyber crimes, and the damage of various malicious attacks to countries and even individuals cannot be underestimated, even on the rise. There is an urgent need to adopt advanced tools for early detection of malware and its variants to help researchers take early steps to defend against it. Its broad approach will help the early malware to detect and identify the behavioral patterns of large amounts of malicious data, and the discipline of artificial intelligence offers broad research potential. The results of these tests will help researchers make decisions and early detection, effectively defense against malware. This work compares and reports a classification of malware detection work based on deep learning algorithms. The 2011–2025 articles were considered, and the latest work focused on the literature for the 2018–2025 years; after screening, 72 articles were selected for the initial study. Future researchers will benefit from this review by better understanding current deep learning models in the field of malware detection. The review includes common methods such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks, focusing on feature extraction techniques such as sequence features, image visualization and data enhancement. The survey summarizes the metrics used to report the accuracy. In addition, it highlights prominent publishers, journals and conferences as platforms for the evaluation of academic works. Taken together, this will help researchers at the current stage gain insight into the unresolved challenges or barriers faced by previous researchers.

We summarized the common categories of leaked app secrets, assessed their security impacts and disclosed app bad practices in storing app secrets. We devised a text mining strategy using regular expressions and demonstrated that numerous app secrets can be easily stolen, even from the highly popular Android apps on Google. In a follow-up study, we harvested 3,711 distinct exploitable app secrets through automatic analysis.

  abstract = {Abstract Given the exponential expansion of the internet, the possibilities of security attacks and cybercrimes have increased accordingly. However, poorly implemented security mechanisms in the Internet of Things (IoT) devices make them susceptible to cyberattacks, which can directly affect users. IoT forensics is thus needed to investigate and mitigate such attacks. While many works have examined IoT applications and challenges, only a few have focused on both the forensic and security issues in IoT. Therefore, this paper reviews forensic and security issues associated with IoT in different fields. Prospects and challenges in IoT research and development are also highlighted. As the literature demonstrates, most IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks due to a lack of standardized security measures. Unauthorized users could get access, compromise data, and even benefit from control of critical infrastructure. To fulfill the security-conscious needs of consumers, IoT can be used to develop a smart home system by designing the security-conscious needs of consumers; IoT can be used to create a smart home system by designing an IoT can be used to develop a smart home system by designing a FLIP-based system that is highly scalable and adaptable. A blockchain-based authentication mechanism with a multi-chain structure can provide additional security protection between different trust domains. Deep learning can be utilized to develop a network forensics framework with a high-performing system for detecting and tracking cyberattack incidents. Moreover, researchers should consider limiting the amount of data created and delivered when using big data to develop IoT-based smart systems. The findings of this review will stimulate academics to seek potential solutions for the identified issues, thereby advancing the IoT field.},

  abstract = {Android operating system, renowned for its open-source nature and flexibility, holds the largest global market share, yet faces significant security challenges, particularly from malware threats. Existing studies often rely on complex feature engineering for malware detection, leading to cumbersome methods prone to noise and lacking effective feature selection mechanisms. Some deep learning approaches also suffer from low efficiency. This paper introduces a lightweight and interpretable Android malware detection system called “FEdroid.” By focusing on code segments that utilize sensitive APIs, the system simplifies the analysis process and extracts key information, employing XGBoost for cross-feature selection to concentrate on a minimal yet crucial feature set. This approach enhances detection accuracy while reducing device resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieved an accuracy of 98.26\% and a false negative rate of only 1.86\% across 18,653 APK samples, significantly improving detection efficiency and accuracy while minimizing deployment resource dependency. Furthermore, the application of Shapley values for interpretive analysis greatly enhances the transparency and understandability of the classifier model, thereby improving the overall interpretability of the system.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of the Android system has sharply increased malicious Android applications, posing multifaceted threats to users. Given the problems of the single feature category and high computational overhead in current Android malware detection methods, this paper proposes a detection method based on feature fusion and an improved stacking integration model. First, seven types of numerical features and function call graphs (FCGs) are extracted from Android installation package files. Next, we apply five statistical methods to filter the numerical features, calculate four types of graph centrality indicators for risky API (application programming interface) nodes in the FCG, and concatenate them as the features of Android applications. These two categories of features correspond to the semantic and structural features of Android applications, respectively, which are static and do not need to be extracted with the help of deep learning techniques. Finally, this approach improves the stacking algorithm, constructing an ensemble classification model that considers the performance differences of the base classifier models and improves detection accuracy by weighting their outputs. The test results on the public dataset CICMalDroid2020 reveal that the method can achieve a detection accuracy of 98.16\% and demonstrates the effectiveness of the feature fusion and integrated model.},

  abstract = {With the widespread adoption of smartphones and the exponential growth of the mobile Internet, the Android platform has emerged as a highly popular choice. However, the platform’s open-source nature has also made it vulnerable to a surge in malware attacks. To address this pressing issue, this research paper introduces a robust malware detection system based on Smali-GRU (gated recurrent unit) network, aimed at enhancing the efficiency of malware detection on the Android platform. The proposed detection system employs a static analysis approach to extract Smali files from Android application packages (APKs). These extracted Smali files then undergo a series of pre-processing steps to extract pertinent features. To ensure compatibility with the GRU model, the preprocessed Smali files are fragmented into smaller segments. The paper explores and tests fragments of varying sizes to identify the optimal configuration that yields the most promising results. The study’s findings highlight that the proposed Smali-GRU model outperforms existing works that employ the same dataset and GRU model, resulting in an impressive accuracy of 98.29\%. Furthermore, the robustness of the model is evaluated using a dataset of obfuscated malware. The results obtained highlight the efficacy and superiority of the proposed model in successfully detecting obfuscated malware in Android applications.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in the domain of software vulnerability detection and management, offering sophisticated capabilities in identifying, analyzing, and mitigating security risks. This article delves into the utilization of LLMs, examining their role in revolutionizing traditional approaches to software vulnerability detection. We explore the various categories of LLMs, such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), and how these models are being leveraged to improve the accuracy and efficiency of vulnerability detection. This article reviews how LLMs are being integrated into existing software security frameworks, synthesizing research findings on their performance in various contexts. It includes insights into how LLM-based methods complement traditional techniques like static analysis and fuzz testing, without engaging in a direct comparative analysis of these approaches. The comparison highlights the strengths of LLMs, such as their ability to generalize across diverse codebases and programming languages, while also addressing their limitations, such as susceptibility to biases from training data and the hallucination. The article synthesizes findings from recent research, showcasing how LLMs have been successfully employed to detect a range of vulnerabilities, from buffer overflows to SQL injections, and outlines how these models enhance productivity by automating the detection and reporting of security flaws. Additionally, we discuss the inherent challenges in applying LLMs to software vulnerability detection, such as the need for high-quality datasets, and the ethical implications related to the deployment of LLM-based systems in security-critical applications. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the future advancement of LLM technologies in the cybersecurity domain. A comprehensive introduction to foundational and specialized datasets is provided, including datasets such as CVEfixes, Big-Vul, and LineVul, which are tailored for software vulnerability detection. These datasets serve as crucial resources for training and benchmarking LLMs. Moreover, we introduce evaluation metrics such as F1-score, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC that are used to assess the performance of models in detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities, offering a structured way to gauge the success and limitations of LLMs. In addition, the article explores fine-tuning techniques such as full fine-tuning, feature extraction, adapter-based fine-tuning, and LoRA (low-rank adaptation), highlighting how each method can enhance LLM performance in vulnerability detection. By focusing on parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, such as adapter layers and prefix-tuning, and LoRa, we outline ways to optimize model performance while reducing computational overhead. By providing a comprehensive review of the literature and practical insights into LLM integration, this article aims to fill the gap in existing research and serve as a foundational guide for future investigations. Researchers and practitioners in the field of software security will benefit from the comparative analyses, detailed case studies, and strategic recommendations provided herein, which collectively highlight the potential of LLMs to complement and enhance traditional software vulnerability detection techniques.},

To address this limitation, this paper proposes an Android malware detection method called GBADroid. GBADroid comprehensively characterizes Android software by considering multi-view features. Specifically, it first matches against a list of dangerous permissions to identify potential risks and then employs an information gain algorithm and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) to extract opcode features. It also constructs a function call graph (FCG) to extract graph features using Graph Sample and Aggregate (GraphSAGE) algorithm. Experimental results show that GBADroid achieves a detection accuracy of 98.73\%, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts are pivotal in blockchain technology. With enviable digital assets, they have long been targeted by hackers. Unlike traditional programs, once deployed, a contract cannot be modified. Therefore, it is particularly essential to conduct vulnerability detection before deploying smart contracts. Fuzzing is a classic technique for detecting security vulnerabilities. However, existing fuzzers are currently unable to capture vulnerabilities hidden in the deep states of smart contracts. In this paper, we propose CSAFuzzer, a fuzzing framework combined with static analysis. Our approach consists of three main steps: First, we statically extract function invocation sequences before dynamically fuzzing contracts, which explore bugs in deep contract states. Secondly, we iteratively generate high-quality test cases based on high code coverage as a metric. This helps in covering more branches within a limited time, thereby increasing the possibility of discovering potential vulnerabilities. Lastly, we design more accurate test oracles to detect smart contract vulnerabilities. We tested CSAFuzzer and other vulnerability detection tools on over 15K real-world smart contracts. Experimental results demonstrate that CSAFuzzer detects more vulnerabilities compared to other state-of-the-art tools, with an average improvement of about 10\% in detection accuracy. Additionally, CSAFuzzer exhibits an average code coverage higher by 6\% than other tools. Notably, 14\% higher than the state-of-the-art fuzzing approach.},

  abstract = {Software applications that run on a blockchain platform are known as DApps. DApps are built using smart contracts, which are immutable after deployment. Just like any real-world software system, DApps need to receive new features and bug fixes over time in order to remain useful and secure. However, Ethereum lacks native solutions for post-deployment smart contract maintenance, requiring developers to devise their own methods. A popular method is known as the upgradeability proxy contract (UPC), which involves implementing the proxy design pattern (as defined by the Gang of Four). In this method, client calls first hit a proxy contract, which then delegates calls to a certain implementation contract. Most importantly, the proxy contract can be reconfigured during runtime to delegate calls to another implementation contract, effectively enabling application upgrades. For researchers, the accurate detection of UPCs is a strong requirement in the understanding of how exactly real-world DApps are maintained over time. For practitioners, the accurate detection of UPCs is crucial for providing application behavior transparency and enabling auditing. In this paper, we introduce UPC Sentinel, a novel three-layer algorithm that utilizes both static and dynamic analysis of smart contract bytecode to accurately detect active UPCs. We evaluated UPC Sentinel using two distinct ground truth datasets. In the first dataset, our method demonstrated a near-perfect accuracy of 99\%. The evaluation on the second dataset further established our method’s efficacy, showing a perfect precision rate of 100\% and a near-perfect recall of 99.3\%, outperforming the state of the art. Finally, we discuss the potential value of UPC Sentinel in advancing future research efforts.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices offer convenience through web interfaces, web VPNs, and other web-based services, all relying on the HTTP protocol. However, these externally exposed HTTP services present significant security risks. Although fuzzing has shown some effectiveness in identifying vulnerabilities in IoT HTTP services, most state-of-the-art tools still rely on random mutation strategies, leading to difficulties in accurately understanding the HTTP protocol’s structure and generating many invalid test cases. Furthermore, These fuzzers rely on a limited set of initial seeds for testing. While this approach initiates testing, the limited number and diversity of seeds hinder comprehensive coverage of complex scenarios in IoT HTTP services. In this paper, we investigate and find that large language models (LLMs) excel in parsing HTTP protocol data and analyzing code logic. Based on these findings, we propose a novel LLM-guided IoT HTTP fuzzing method, ChatHTTPFuzz, which automatically parses protocol fields and analyzes service code logic to generate protocol-compliant test cases. Specifically, we use LLMs to label fields in HTTP protocol data, creating seed templates. Second, The LLM analyzes service code to guide the generation of additional packets aligned with the code logic, enriching the seed templates and their field values. Finally, we design an enhanced Thompson sampling algorithm based on the exploration balance factor and mutation potential factor to schedule seed templates. We evaluate ChatHTTPFuzz on 16 different real-world IoT devices. It finds more vulnerabilities than SNIPUZZ, BOOFUZZ, and MUTINY. ChatHTTPFuzz has discovered 116 vulnerabilities, of which 70 are unique, and 23 have been assigned CVEs.},

  abstract = {The introduction of Industry 4.0 and Internet-based technologies has enhanced industrial control system operations but have inadvertently increased their vulnerabilities to cyber attacks. When an industrial control system is compromised, security analysts need to identify the root cause quickly to start the recovery process and develop mitigation strategies. Memory forensics is critical in the incident analysis process to ascertain what occurred. Approaches for analyzing the persistent memory in industrial control devices are limited and almost nonexistent for volatile memory. This chapter proposes an automated methodology for programmable logic controller memory dump analysis using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The methodology converts the sequences of bytes in a programmable logic controller memory dump to red-green-blue pixels and employs a deep learning model that learns the underlying patterns and features of pre-labeled forensic artifacts in images and segments them into distinct regions. The trained model is employed to automatically segment new memory images and identify forensic artifacts. Evaluation of the methodology on a Schneider Electric Modicon M221 programmable logic controller under code injection and code modification attacks demonstrates its ability to detect attack artifacts in memory dumps.},

The system is designed for free-market emission trading to realize incentives for clean transportation behaviors by punishing fossil fuel vehicles and rewarding new energy vehicles. To better contribute a high-performance and low-cost structure, Ethereum 2.0 and Rollups are adopted for the development of the new system. A discussion is conducted to illustrate the design advantages and social impact of this theoretical system. In the end, we analyze the feasibility of the proposed system.},

  abstract = {In this ubiquitous age of mobile phones, Android malware is a growing threat to mobile users. The most common malware detection technique is analyzing different features that any Android app encompasses. However, malware developers have become increasingly sophisticated; hence, these Android app features can’t be revealed easily. One way to address this problem is to apply reverse engineering on the Android app executable file, which will eventually decompose the app into low-level source codes. After that, these source codes can be analyzed for subsequent identification of features, which will ultimately help to segregate malware from the benignware. In this article, a step-by-step procedure has been demonstrated to extract four important features (declared permission, intent, component, and hardware/software) from the Android app using reverse engineering. This will open a path for new researchers in this domain.},

As their results are poor, this research compares five methods to identify the category of mobile games: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks. We use a large collection of 147,128 mobile games to ensure diversity in our data set. We extract features from game descriptions, manifest encodings and from application packages. To capture the semantic meaning of words, we use four embedding methods: Word2Vec, fastText, BERT, MiniLM. For each embedding method, we evaluate the performance of the classifiers. Our results show that Extreme Gradient Boosting can outperform existing work, achieving 81\% precision in classification.},

It is a critical step in binary analysis and is considered as a challenging task over stripped binaries. While existing studies have shown that it is feasible to efficiently and accurately perform function boundary detection over C stripped binaries, it remains unknown whether these methods will perform well over Rust stripped binaries. In this paper, we experimentally evaluate and compare four methods/tools, including two industry reverse engineering tools (Ghirda and IDA Pro) and two neural-network-based methods, in the context of function boundary detection over Rust binaries. We establish a large-scale dataset consisting of 2,471 Rust binaries (with over 8.69 million functions) across five optimization levels and develop two tools to perform analyses automatically. We derive two major findings based on our experimental results. First, one of the two neural-network-based methods, named XDA, can achieve promising results (e.g., 94.8\% precision and 85.5\% recall over binaries compiled with O0) and outperform other methods/tools in detecting function boundaries over Rust binaries, except over binaries from Oz optimization. Second, although Ghidra and IDA Pro can accurately detect function starts, they are not effective on precisely distinguishing function ends over Rust binaries.},

The aim is to determine whether these practices are justified by the apps’ functionalities, and comply with regulatory standards to adequately protect children. Using a traffic light system inspired by the ICO audits, each app is rated green, amber, or red taking into account dangerous permissions and runtime trackers in use. Only one app reached an overall green rating, while 10 apps achieved an overall red rating. The majority of tracker companies (20 out of 21) are based outside the UK or EU, including the US, Russia, China, Israel and India, and two trackers are linked to profiling and fingerprinting of users.

This study conducts a large-scale security and privacy analysis of 381 suspicious free mHealth apps (chosen from a corpus of 15,893 apps) available on “Google Play”. We built a customized toolset to perform a comprehensive analysis of these apps. We explore the range of mechanisms used by mHealth apps to monitor users’ activities, such as photos, text messages, and live microphone access, mainly through the injection of suspicious third-party libraries. In addition, we uncover the use of obfuscation methods employed by suspicious mHealth apps to hide their malicious codes. As mHealth apps are used by a large number of customers worldwide, we argue that patients, clinicians, technology developers, and policy-makers alike should be conscious of the hidden risks involved and weigh them carefully against the benefits.},

  abstract = {In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, ransomware poses an escalating threat; adversaries employ advanced encryption techniques to render critical data inaccessible and evade traditional defenses. Specifically, ransomware developers utilize intricate strategies that undermine heuristic file monitoring and file system attribute analysis, rendering current detection methods ineffective against such attacks. This study tests and analyzes the performance of models that focus on the file system level. The goal is to improve detection by using statistically measurable attributes that are specific to the file system. For instance, statistically measurable data can be derived from the blocks of the write buffer transmitted from endpoints to storage servers. We investigate the effectiveness of various machine learning classifiers in detecting encryption activities at the storage level, using a substantial dataset of 32.6 GB comprising 11,928 files encrypted by 75 ransomware families. We integrate novel statistical components to augment the system’s ability to detect encryption, notwithstanding the adaptive tactics of ransomware that reduce entropy measures and alter call frequencies to evade classification. Our in-depth study looks at these classifiers in the context of ransomware that uses partial and intermittent encryption and online learning methods to make them more flexible in a threat environment that changes quickly. In benchmark tests, the Hoeffding Tree algorithm consistently performs well. It works especially well against types of ransomware that use intermittent encryption methods.},

  abstract = {Real-Person Authentication Systems (RPAuS) are used for secure remote access to financial transactions, online services, and private information. The rise of Deepfake technology poses a significant threat to RPAuS, as it can impersonate registered users to perform authentication. However, the resilience of RPAuS against advanced Deepfake attacks remains underexplored. Previous studies have explored Deepfake attacks on RPAuS, but they typically involve intrusive modifications, emulator-based testing, and pre-generated Deepfake videos. These methods are not universally applicable, as RPAuS often fails to run on emulators, especially in security-sensitive areas, and do not ensure Deepfake videos align with the app’s random liveness actions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for universally evaluating RPAuS security against Deepfake attacks across various apps. It customizes the Android camera system and modifies the workflow of image transmission, allowing network communication to transmit camera-captured images to a local server that enables synchronized manipulation. Our framework generates forgery authentication videos that comply with the app’s random liveness instructions. Additionally, It bypasses app risk detection mechanisms and is optimized for real-time performance. We deployed this framework on real devices and tested 19 popular apps. Results show that our framework effectively evaluates RPAuS security in all tested apps, while over half of these apps fail to launch or activate RPAuS on emulators. Notably, over 70\% of the tested apps exhibited vulnerabilities to Deepfake attacks, underscoring the urgent need for enhanced security measures.},

Although the nuisance of ransomware generators has been mentioned by a few security reports, our community lacks an understanding of the characteristics of these Android ransomware generators. In this paper, we take the first step towards systematically studying Android ransomware generators. We analyze the RaaS business model from multiple perspectives including their behaviors, practices, generated apps, and ecosystem. We observe that deceptive tactics exist in some so-called ransomware generator apps, such as malware masquerading and developer spoofing. For the generated ransomware, we reveal their common locking mechanisms and a variety of unlocking mechanisms. We also provide an overview of the ecosystem by revealing the participating entities, propagation channels, and workflow.

The structure of binary code is incredibly flexible allowing for ad-hoc subtyping and polymorphism. Prior work has shown that precise type inference on binary code requires expressive subtyping and polymorphism. Implementations of these type system features in a binary type inference algorithm have thus-far been too inefficient to achieve widespread adoption. Recent advances in traditional type inference have achieved simple and efficient principal type inference in an ML like language with subtyping and polymorphism through the framework of algebraic subtyping. BinSub, a new binary type inference algorithm, recognizes the connection between algebraic subtyping and the type system features required to analyze binaries effectively. Using this connection, BinSub achieves simple, precise, and efficient binary type inference. We show that BinSub maintains a similar precision to prior work, while achieving a 63x improvement in average runtime for 1568 functions. We also present a formalization of BinSub and show that BinSub’s type system maintains the expressiveness of prior work.},

Along with the development of various applications for these devices, new malicious apps are released by intruders, which are more difficult to identify and deal with because they exploit more sophisticated techniques. Although methods have been provided to calculate the security risk and identify malicious apps in Android operating system, but with the expansion of the level and depth of the threats, the need for more effective methods in this context is still required. In this paper, we have devised a new algorithm to calculate the security risk of Android apps, which can be used to identify malicious apps from benign ones. In this algorithm, to estimate the security risk of an unknown input app, its nearest neighbors to malicious apps and its nearest neighbors to normal apps are computed separately using Hamming distance. Then, the security risk of the input app can be computed using a simple formulation. After implementing this algorithm, its parameter for the number of neighbors using various real datasets is adjusted. The extensive experiments conducted on these data show the superiority of the proposed method over the previously proposed ones in terms of detection rate. Our additional experimentations show the robustness of the proposed algorithm in adversarial situations.},

This paper presents a semantic code clone detector that utilizes machine learning algorithms on top of the low-level abstract compiled code intermediate representation known as Baf. The proposed technique has been implemented and assessed using real-world code clone pairs from the BigCloneBench dataset written in Java. Multiple experiments have been conducted, and the results have shown that the proposed technique outperforms several baseline methods in detecting semantic clones regarding recall and an F1 score.},

  abstract = {Blockchain-enabled smart contracts execute without third-party involvement when specific conditions are met. This system significantly reduces the use of paper-based processes while managing substantial funds. As such, it has become the target of hackers. It has suffered several attacks, particularly the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) attack and the Parity multi-sig wallet hack, which had severe consequences. This has triggered the need for better security measures as the use of this technology has increased significantly in recent years. Several tools have been developed to tackle various problems while they still lack better achievements. As deep learning achieved better results in vulnerability detection domain, we proposed a deep-learning approach using bidirectional long-short term memory (BLSTM) to classify contract either vulnerable (detection of suicidal, prodigal and greedy contracts) or non-vulnerable. The aim was to propose a detection technique that might achieve better results so as to encourage the use of deep learning techniques. The experiment was conducted on a HPC (High-Performance Computing) cluster where each server has a processing power of 2.2 GHz and a RAM of 128G at least. We were able to achieve an accuracy and F1 score of 94\%. This works also set a new benchmark to better smart contract detection while promoting future researches axes.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts have transformed blockchain applications, enabling decentralized computation and automated asset management without intermediaries. However, with the growth of decentralized finance, the high financial stakes make smart contract vulnerabilities particularly critical. Because vulnerabilities often go undetected, they lead to substantial losses and diminished trust in blockchain systems. Symbolic execution has emerged as a powerful technique to uncover subtle vulnerabilities by systematically exploring feasible execution paths. However, most existing symbolic execution tools for smart contracts are tailored to specific vulnerability patterns, making them unsuitable for detecting new types of vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce Greed , a highly versatile symbolic execution framework for Ethereum (or EVM-based) smart contracts. Greed features a state-of-the-art symbolic execution engine coupled with a suite of supporting analyses and a modular design that allows security researchers to prototype new analyses rapidly. To evaluate the effectiveness and extensibility of Greed , we compare it with the state-of-the-art. We first show that Greed can explore significantly more code paths – reaching 84\% of all CALL statements, as opposed to 9\% on average across existing tools. To demonstrate the ease of use (and extensibility) of Greed , we then implement a novel analysis to detect controllable JUMPI instructions and evaluate it against all deployed contracts on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), identifying 390 previously unknown vulnerable contracts. By releasing Greed to the community, we aim to lower the barrier to developing advanced security analyses for smart contracts, empowering security researchers to rapidly prototype new analyses and contribute to a more secure and resilient blockchain ecosystem.},

To gain deeper insights into vulnerability patterns and patching behaviors in multi-language code, we conduct a measurement study on commits associated with multi-language security patches. We first collect a large-scale dataset of multi-language security patches from the MITRE corporation. We then analyze trends in language combinations, assess their proneness to vulnerabilities, and compare the severity of these vulnerabilities to those in single-language patches. Additionally, we classify patch patterns based on the types of language interactions to support automated program repair. To encourage further research, we release our dataset to the community, fostering deeper investigation into multi-language security patch development and enhancement.},

  abstract = {Code obfuscation alters software code to conceal its logic while retaining functionality, aiding intellectual property protection but hindering security audits and malware analysis. To address this, automated deobfuscation techniques have been developed, though existing approaches remain constrained by limited scope and specificity. Motivated by these challenges, this paper explores a novel approach for code deobfuscation based on Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we investigate the general capabilities of LLMs in reducing code complexity by choosing five different source-to-source obfuscation methods. Despite challenges regarding semantical correctness, our findings indicate that LLMs can be very effective in this task. Building on this, we fine-tune two versatile models capable of simplifying code obfuscated through up to seven different chained obfuscation transformations while consistently outperforming deobfuscation based on compiler optimizations and general-purpose LLMs. Our best model demonstrates an average Halstead metric program length reduction of 89.21\% for our most challenging scenario. Finally, we conduct a memorization test to assess if performance stems from memorized code rather than true deobfuscation capabilities, which our models pass.},

However, verifying assembly code against a realistic machine model is a challenging task. Furthermore, certain security properties—such as constant-time behavior—require relational reasoning that goes beyond traditional correctness by linking multiple execution traces within a single specification. Yet, relational verification has been extensively explored at a higher level of abstraction. In this work, we introduce a Hoare-style logic that provides low-level, expressive relational verification. We demonstrate our approach on the s2n-bignum library, proving both constant-time discipline and equivalence between optimized and verification-friendly routines. Formalized in HOL Light, our results confirm the real-world applicability of relational verification in large assembly codebases.},

Especially when the software is very complicated, bug localization and repair become particularly difficult. The aim of the article is to analyze reverse debugging, program structure defect mining, location and repair methods, and enhance the security and stability of software. The binary code is first processed through a combination of several reverse tools, static analysis tools SonarQube and Checkmax to find out potential program structure defects, and then pass the combination of dynamic symbol execution and fuzzy testing method to monitor the behavior of the program during runtime, in order to further verify defects found by static analysis, and to detect new defects generated during runtime. The effectiveness of the method is further evinced by an experiment using 100 open source software. In most cases, the detection rate of static analysis method for structure defects is 78\%, while dynamic analysis on the cloud actually confirms that 92\% of these defects are true, so reverse debugging fully satisfies the requirement of using the value stored in the register ESP of the local stack to locate the position on the reference source. After passing the run, the pass rate of software in security testing increases from 85\% to 95\%, indicating that the application of the method can increase the security and reliability of software. The integrated method can locate and repair buggy structure defects of a program, so that the software has fewer security flaws, and better quality.},

Our approach is evaluated through a human study, where untrained respondents with minimal training successfully flag machine misclassifications.

  abstract = {Well-trained deep neural networks (DNN), including large language models (LLM), are valuable intellectual property assets. To defend against model extraction attacks, one of the major ideas proposed in a large body of previous research is obfuscation: splitting the original DNN and storing the components separately. However, systematically analyzing the methods’ security against various attacks and optimizing the efficiency of defenses are still challenging. In this paper, We propose a taxonomy of model-based extraction attacks, which enables us to identify vulnerabilities of several existing obfuscation methods. We also propose an extremely efficient model obfuscation method called \\(\\mathsf \{O\textasciicircum{}\{2\}Splitter\}\\) using trusted execution environment (TEE). The secrets we store in TEE have \\(\{\\mathcal \{O\}\} (1)\\) -size, i.e., independent of model size. Although \\(\\mathsf \{O\textasciicircum{}\{2\}Splitter\}\\) relies on a pseudo-random function to provide a quantifiable guarantee for protection and noise compression, it does not need any complicated training or filtering of the weights. Our comprehensive experiments show that \\(\\mathsf \{O\textasciicircum{}\{2\}Splitter\}\\) can mitigate norm-clipping and fine-tuning attacks. Even for small noise ( \\(\\epsilon = 50 \\) ), the accuracy of the obfuscated model is close to random guess, and the tested attacks cannot extract a model with comparable accuracy. In addition, the empirical results also shed light on discovering the relation between DP parameters in obfuscation and the risks of concrete extraction attacks.},

Furthermore, these technologies are being used for more than just connecting people around the world. Indeed, Android devices are more and more connected to external sensors or used as sensors, directly gathering data from their environment, which brings them closer to Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) . When used for specific purposes such as health, Android devices and related applications can be life-critical (insulin pumps, heart monitoring, etc.), requiring guarantees specific to the application domain. Interestingly, when considering the technical security in domains related to operational technologies, we can see that many standards are available while not directly intended for Android applications. Other regulatory texts can also be valuable to drive an audit process, although they need more effort to reach technically testable requirements from the legal requirements they define. In particular, Android applications are developed using various device permissions (i.e., resource access), external libraries, etc. In this paper, we present A3S3 a tool to link requirements from industry standards and regulatory texts to Android features to drive a security audit. Following research in the cyber-security community, we suggest an approach based on static code analysis of Android applications to retrieve good and bad signals , denoting potential violations, related to non-functional requirements.},

Our two semantics stay faithful to the original, informal specification of the language but also clarify under-specified cases such as void function calls.

However, one issue arises when a model under transformation references artifacts such as source code files or binary executables: Model transformations typically do not consider the referenced artifacts, resulting in the possibility of them becoming incompatible with the final model after transformation. As a result, the referenced artifacts often require manual adaptations which can be complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. To address this issue, we present an approach that integrates artifact translation mechanisms into the model transformation process. In addition to the translation between different concrete artifacts during model transformation, our approach also enables the use of abstract artifacts in models in order to translate them into concrete artifacts during model refinement, which is a special type of model transformation. To validate the practical feasibility of our approach, we present a prototype and two case studies in the domain of quantum software engineering.},

  abstract = {Cybersecurity is critical in today’s digital world, where the severity of threats from software vulnerabilities grows significantly each year. Many techniques have been developed to analyze vulnerabilities in source code. However, source code is not always available (for example, most industry software is closed-source). As a result, analyzing vulnerabilities in binary code becomes necessary and more challenging. This paper presents a novel approach called BiVulD for detecting vulnerabilities at the binary level. BiVulD has three phases: generating assembly language instructions, learning good embeddings, and building a prediction model. First, we create a database of vulnerable binaries using CVE and NVD. Next, we propose using codeBERT to obtain good embeddings. Finally, we apply a bidirectional LSTM on top of codeBERT to build the predictive model. To demonstrate BiVulD’s effectiveness, we compared it with several baselines, including source code-based, binary code-based, and machine learning-based techniques on real-world projects. The experimental results show that BiVulD outperforms the baselines and can detect more vulnerabilities. For instance, BiVulD achieves at least 20\% improvement in Precision, Recall, and F-measure. We believe this work will serve as a foundation for future research in vulnerability detection using only binary code.},

  abstract = {Ransomware continues to be an effective and lucrative means to extort large sums of money from organizations which depend on reliable access to data to meet their objectives. Often, the public embarrassment associated with falling victim to a ransomware attack is an effective motivator to pay and avoid the damaging headlines. The goal of this research is to improve the ability of security teams to identify ransomware samples in real-time. This type of determination has traditionally been difficult as attackers have been able to make small changes to malware to create variants which still infect systems but are not recognized by existing analysis tools. The work presented here uniquely leverages leaked source code which has been used by malicious actors to create custom ransomware variants for real ransomware campaigns. By isolating individual options for a build, we are able to determine ground truth and fingerprint its behavior using hardware-based side channel data collected by a CPU performance monitoring tool. This approach allowed us to successfully identify the Hardware Performance Counters and associated function calls which are directly correlated with specific capabilities inherent to the prolific Lockbit 3.0 ransomware. The specific function calls identified were those used to terminate Windows Defender protection and to search for shared network resources to encrypt. The methodology presented will help analysts detect ransomware samples for which there is no existing signature and narrow the scope of follow-on analysis, thus saving valuable time.},

We suggest and evaluate improved deep learning methods for Trojan horse attack detection using the Kaggle-hosted Trojan Detection dataset. Deep learning may help cybersecurity identify Trojan horses. These neural network methods find bad trends in massive data. Deep learning models re more accurate and efficient than traditional detection approaches because they adapt to changing threats. Recent research demonstrates that new Trojan horse detection methods are quicker and more accurate. It prevents data breaches and unauthorized access, making it a vital cybersecurity improvement. This work makes use of these techniques. To achieve a high degree of accuracy in identifying malicious software, our technique is based on the classification of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We preprocess and enrich the dataset to enhance the model’s generalizability. As a result of extensive testing and optimization, Trojan horse attacks and other cyberattacks risk sensitive data and systems. Trojan horses and malicious software masquerading as legitimate, may be catastrophic. CNN-based classification solves this. From Kaggle’s Trojan Detection dataset.

This research paper analyzes mHealth apps for security vulnerabilities due to solo or small team development using the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)’s Top 10 vulnerabilities guidance and Quick Android Review Kit (QARK). By synthesizing insights from previous studies, the research highlights the critical importance of security in mHealth app development and the need for comprehensive security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of these applications. The analysis reveals that vulnerabilities in mHealth apps are primarily attributed to weak authentication and authorization, inadequate server-side control, lack of encryption, insecure communication, inadequate user input validation, and unprotected API usage. Future research will focus on strategies for enhancing the solo or small team developers’ security knowledge, resources availability, and supporting the integration of robust security practices throughout the development lifecycle to enhance the resilience of mHealth applications against cyber-threats and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive health data.},

Secondly, A multi-scale convolutional neural network is leveraged to derive social network representations from the call graph, enhancing both local and global information expression. Subsequently, the two-view features are integrated via a cross-attention strategy, which facilitates more effective modeling of feature correlations and enhances classification accuracy.

  abstract = {Obfuscation is commonly employed to protect sensitive program assets in legitimate use cases or to conceal malicious behavior in the context of malware. By altering the binary code of a compiled program, obfuscation disrupts binary analysis techniques, such as binary diffing or similarity. However, there is little comprehensive academic research addressing the effects of obfuscation on binary analysis tools and quantifying its impact. In this study, we examine how different types of obfuscation influence binary diffing algorithms. Specifically, we demonstrate a clear relationship between the type of obfuscation and the performance of the diffing algorithms used. Our benchmarks emphasize that, contrary to common assumptions, intra-procedural and data obfuscations have a limited impact on binary diffing when applied alone. In contrast, inter-procedural obfuscations significantly affect the diffing process, degrading performances by up to 40 f1-score points when comparing low and high obfuscation levels. These results highlight the need for modular diffing approaches, where parameters and features can be fine-tuned to handle adversarial scenarios, such as obfuscation. To support this research, we have released a comprehensive dataset comprising pairs of clear and obfuscated compiled programs, along with metadata specifying the type and exact location of each obfuscation. This dataset is intended to facilitate further research in this area.},

Among them, API hashing conceals the identity of imported library functions—key indicators for understanding malware behavior—by replacing their standard names with hashed values. Currently, resolving these obfuscated calls relies heavily on manual expertise and community-maintained hash repositories, both of which are time-consuming and difficult to scale. In this work, we explore an automated approach to deobfuscate API hashing. By leveraging dynamic program analysis, we identify and map hash values back to their original function names while also extracting information about the hashing scheme. Our method can then use malware itself as a “hash oracle”, enabling on-demand resolution of standard function names through the malware’s hashing logic, enabling automatic updates of repositories.},

Our evaluation of AutoAcRaptor on two AOSP and eight automaker AAOS images demonstrates that it is able to identify 23 auto feature and access control anomalies, on average per ROM.

Such information is valuable for debugging, optimizing performance, and analyzing security vulnerabilities, such as in side-channel attacks where execution times can be exploited. To address this issue, we propose a sound static analysis based on abstract interpretation to quantify the impact of each input variable on the global number of iterations. Our approach combines a dependency analysis with a global loop bound analysis to derive an over-approximation of the impact quantity.

We performed several static and dynamic security analyses using tools such as the Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) and Android emulators. We also checked the server’s security levels with Qualys SSL, which allowed us to gain insights into the security posture of the servers communicating with the mHealth fitness apps. Our findings revealed many vulnerabilities, such as insecure coding, hardcoded sensitive information, over-privileged permissions, misconfiguration, and excessive communication with third-party domains. For instance, some apps store their database API key directly in the code while also exposing their database URL. We found insecure encryption methods in six apps, such as using AES with ECB mode. Two apps communicated with an alarming number of approximately 230 domains each, and a third app with over 100 domains, exacerbating privacy linkability threats. The study underscores the importance of continuous security assessments of top-ranked mHealth fitness apps to better understand the threat landscape and inform app developers.},

  abstract = {Obfuscation is a method that safeguards intellectual property rights against malicious analysts by altering the structure, logic, and other aspects of a program. However, malicious developers utilize obfuscation methods in their malware to avoid detection and analysis. To deobfuscate malware, analysts leverage their analysis skills alongside deobfuscation methodology. Although obfuscation is widely used in malware, heuristic-based deobfuscation methodology has limitations, including reliance on specific obfuscation tools and inefficiency in large-scale processing. In this paper, we propose ChatDEOB, an effective deobfuscation method that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM). We focus on the LLM’s application in various software engineering areas, such as code analysis, generation, and fuzzing, and employ it in our deobfuscation method. To effectively deobfuscate, we fine-tune the LLM model in detail and implement ChatDEOB using well-designed prompt engineering methods. To the best of our knowledge, ChatDEOB is the first method to deobfuscate code using a fine-tuned LLM model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatDEOB, we utilize SacreBLEU, a published obfuscation evaluation method, along with the Obfuscation Quality Quantification Framework. The experiment resulted in the SacreBLEU score increasing from an initial average of 22.71 to 49.12, achieving a 116.27\% improvement and demonstrating significant effectiveness. Additionally, when measuring the six evaluation indicators of the Obfuscation Quality Quantification Framework, the deobfuscation effect shows an average improvement of 85\% compared to the obfuscated code.},

  abstract = {In the era of widespread use of smartphones, researchers have been exploring new detection methods to cope with the threat of constantly upgrading Android malware. With the emergence of graphical neural networks, people’s interest in using this technology to detect Android malware has surged. However, external connections between Android malware are often overlooked, and the graph structure is filled with redundant information. To address these challenges, this article introduces AnGSL, a graph based method designed specifically for Android malware detection. This method first uses the MTF-IDF algorithm to extract feature entities, and then calculates the Euclidean distance between the feature vectors of two Android applications to determine whether there are edges between them. Subsequently, two subgraphs were constructed using the K-nearest neighbor and diffusion matrix algorithms, and optimized and merged to obtain the final graph structure. Finally, by minimizing the cross entropy loss between the subgraph and the optimized graph, a contrastive learning method is used to train the model. Experimental evaluations conducted on publicly available Android datasets showed a detection accuracy of 98.24\%. Research has shown that compared with previous model methods, the method proposed in this paper has a certain degree of performance improvement, indicating that graph based Android malware detection has broad potential and prospects in the research field.},

In this study, we propose a new approach to detecting obfuscated malware based on Smali bytecode analysis, instruction categorization into families, N-gram vectorization and machine learning techniques. We collected a dataset comprising 8,000 obfuscated APKs from VirusTotal, with half labeled as malicious and half as benign. The dataset includes recent samples from 2024, ensuring the relevance of our results. We extracted the Smali bytecode from each APK, categorized the instructions into families, then transformed them into ordered sequences of n-grams. Our method relies on the use of ensemble learning algorithms to combine the strengths of various models. In particular, we used Random Forest and XGBoost in combination with an n-gram vectorization process of categorized Smali instructions. This approach enabled us to achieve an average F1-score of 0.96 (± 0.01) in cross-validation and a precision of 0.98 for detecting malware and 0.94 for detecting benign software on the test set, with an average recall of 0.96, the overall F1 score also reached 0.96. Our approach, which integrates Smali bytecode analysis, instruction family categorization, and ensemble learning, has demonstrated promising results in detecting obfuscated malware. These findings underscore the importance of a detailed analysis of Smali bytecode and the effectiveness of ensemble learning algorithms in identifying obfuscated malware.},

Generative AI also impacts other areas such as content generation, data analysis, and can be used to automate various systems. From a security point of view, initial applications of LLMs improve customer support services - be it direct customer support or security operation centers - and also the way an IT administrator connects with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) or XDR (Extended Detection and Response) products. However, there were fewer practical attempts to use LLMs to improve the detection rate or a security product at large. The current paper explores this direction by analyzing the detection rate of several LLMs (ChatGPT, LLama, Mistral, Orca2, Falcon) against a recent set of macro VBA (Visual Basic for Application) malware. The respective performance levels are discussed. Other relevant issues, such as inference cost, memory and space requirements and practicality from a security product point of view, are also considered. Even if the models used in our research do not reach adequate results in terms of detection rate they can still be used in security operation centers to assist a security researcher to analyse malicious content. Furthermore, additional fine-tuning might improve the accuracy of such models to a point where they may become a good choice for various security tasks.},

The first, the binary approach, exploits static analysis and instruction simulation to extract schemas directly from validation logic.

We evaluate both methods on self-compiled binaries and third-party FlatBuffer schemas. The binary approach consistently extracts full schemas, aiding in vulnerability detection.

  abstract = {Digital forensic practitioners face two key challenges when investigating Internet of Things devices. One is the need to reverse engineer a plethora of different devices and the other is the volatility of device data, including deleted data. This chapter attempts to address these challenges by focusing on the extraction of Internet of Things device data from the cloud by leveraging private application programming interfaces, an area that is relatively understudied in digital forensics. Specifically, this chapter presents the results of a study of decrypted traffic between six Android mobile apps (not the Internet of Things devices) and their respective cloud systems. The study results point to the feasibility of the approach and highlight the challenge involved in discovering additional application programming interface endpoints in a non-intrusive manner.},

  abstract = {When analyzing the production control factors of gas wells in the Deng4 gas reservoir of the Sinian system in central Sichuan, it was found that gas wells with developed fractured-vuggy reservoir have significant differences in production characteristics due to different types of fractures. Simply treating reservoirs with developed fractures and dissolution vugs as fractured-vuggy type reservoir is difficult to accurately evaluate the high and stable production capacity of gas wells. Based on the description of the development characteristics of rock core fractures, this article divides the fractures interpreted by imaging logging into three types: open fractures, low angle dissolution expansion fractures, and high angle dissolution expansion fractures. Combined with the development of dissolution vugs, a reservoir classification method and standard considering the genesis and type of fractures are established. It is confirmed that the development of pore-vuggy and low angle fractured-vuggy type reservoirs are the main factors affecting the high and stable production of gas wells, laying the foundation for the optimization of development and production areas.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts have been developing rapidly in various industries, and their security problems have become increasingly severe, posing significant economic threats. Consequently, the identification of vulnerability in smart contracts is essential for the governance of blockchain. Deep learning has achieved remarkable strides in bolstering software security, and deep learning and smart contract vulnerability detection have become a new research focus. Existing smart contract vulnerability detection methods have difficulty eliminating the influence of redundant information, leading to insufficient special extraction, which leads to missed and false alarms. To bolster the security of smart contracts, we introduce a novel technique that leverages the temporal convolutional network (TCN), specifically the HETCN model. This model refines the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to mitigate the impact of superfluous data, thereby enhancing feature extraction. Moreover, the TCN integrates the squeeze-and-excitation network mechanism to distinguish the weights of the data and overcome long-range dependency. We perform reentrancy vulnerability detection on the widely used public dataset SmartBugs Wild. The results indicate that our HETCN method detects reentrancy vulnerability with a higher accuracy of 95.81\%. Compared with other detection methods, HETCN can better identify reentrancy vulnerability.},

This paper presents a vulnerability detection method that uses convolutional neural networks to automate the analysis of privacy-preserving code, with a focus on preserving code privacy. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method successfully removes privacy information from the code, and the modifications to the original code cause deviations from its intended functionality or even result in its failure to execute correctly.

  abstract = {The Internet has transformed into a hub for a wide array of illegal activities, ranging from annoying spam ads to financial scams, all thanks to advancements in modern technology. With the constant enhancements in network technology, data traffic on the Internet is ballooning in both volume and scope. Consequently, the complexity and prevalence of cyber threats and attacks are on the rise, with websites becoming the prime targets for hackers. These intruders, or hackers, embed harmful content into web pages with the intent of carrying out nefarious activities. They employ various tactics, such as hacking into computers or trying to harvest information through compromised or malicious websites. Some of these tactics involve injecting malicious software into web links. Therefore, it has become more critical than ever to identify and block such websites before the average user can stumble upon them. In this paper, we propose a method that utilizes machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent websites. We evaluate the prediction accuracy of different machine learning classification methods in this study. We trained our model using various algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, and AdaBoost. Ultimately, we employed an ensemble approach and achieved an outstanding accuracy rate of 99.98\%, surpassing other methods in effectiveness.},

This paper evaluates the features used in existing approaches by utilizing various datasets, including programs written for the Google Code Jam programming competition, student projects from programming courses at multiple universities, and content from GitHub repositories. Additionally, we examined the impact of statistical features on precision, recall, and the false positive rate of these methodologies. The evaluation results reveal that the accuracy of these approaches varies across different application domains and datasets, and some of the selected features appear unrelated to the author’s style, indicating that careful consideration is needed when applying this approach.

While machine learning classifiers offer quick detection and can identify complex malicious features, they are susceptible to backdoor attacks. We introduce GAT, a genetic algorithm-based approach for generating effective and stealthy Android backdoors. Using the SHAP interpretability tool, we first select efficient features as primary backdoors. A fitness function then enables iterative optimization through a genetic algorithm. Additionally, we propose a method to integrate backdoor features into the source code, maintaining functionality while facilitating attacks on Android classifiers in real data outsourcing scenarios. Our evaluation of the Drebin and Mamadroid malware detectors in data outsourcing scenarios indicates that an attack success rate exceeding 70\% can be achieved with only 5\% poisoned samples and a minimal number of trigger features, while keeping the false positive rate below 10\% and the label flipping rate below 30\%. Additionally, the performance degradation of the classifiers remains within 5\%. This work provides new insights into backdoor attack methodologies in Android malware classifiers.},

With the changes in the data management mode of oil companies, data management technology has also progressed and developed. We take several measures to address the challenges of decentralized seismic data management, incomplete supporting governance system, and difficulty in online secure sharing and application of large data volume. First, we have established an integrated seismic data model, optimized the hierarchical storage mechanism of seismic data, and developed a full-process quality control tool for seismic data, forming a full-life cycle management model for seismic results data. Secondly, we have developed supporting technologies such as efficient transmission of large data, rapid integration of geographic information, and full-text search of seismic documents, which have innovated the application mode of seismic data sharing. Thirdly, through cloud deployment of seismic processing and interpretation software, we have developed a two-way integration technology from basic seismic data to project research environment, which greatly improves the efficiency of data application. Since the system was launched, it has fully managed seismic-related data within the oilfield, ensuring the security of oilfield data assets. Moreover, utilizing multi-process management of intermediate seismic, it significantly shortens the seismic processing cycle. Using multi-version management of interpretation results, it effectively supports application scenarios such as basin-level seismic interpretation. Currently, the innovative data management and service technology has been extended to data management fields such as logging and VSP, forming an integrated management approach for large-block data of oilfield.},

  abstract = {Binary code similarity detection is crucial in security applications. Recent studies have shown that deep learning-based methods have made significant progress. However, they face inherent efficiency bottlenecks due to their computational demands and large-scale data processing overhead in function-level similarity comparisons. To address this issue, we propose a pre-filtering method named PreFilter that aims to reduce the data scale of functions waiting for detection. This method consists of two key steps. First, the PreFilter features of all the functions in the function pool are extracted. Second, the PreFilter features are normalized as vectors, used to compute the similarity and obtain the top M functions for a fine-grained comparison. Among them, the selection of PreFilter features is a step that we carefully design. It consists mainly of two key steps. First, several initial features are extracted from the binary code of the function, and then these features are evaluated and ranked according to ANOVA and MAE. Second, the top P features are chosen to represent the functions, where P is determined by balancing feature representation capability and extraction time. In addition, a novel evaluation metric, FRecall is introduced to calculate the retention rate of actual vulnerability functions during pre-filtering. The cross-architecture Firm-Vul dataset is developed to evaluate our method in real firmware vulnerability detection scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that the state-of-the-art methods, when incorporating PreFilter, maintain the MRR, while the search efficiency of the function is 2.4× faster. In the vulnerability search task, the search efficiency is improved by 2.19×.},

We evaluate their accuracy and generalization to unknown vulnerabilities. Results show that while both models face challenges with fragmented or sparse context, CodeBERT performs comparatively better in such scenarios, whereas CodeT5 excels in capturing complex vulnerability patterns. CodeT5 also demonstrates superior scalability. Furthermore, we test fine-tuned models on both in-distribution (trained) and out-of-distribution (unseen) datasets.

Conventional single-feature-based detection models struggle to keep pace with the rapidly evolving landscape of Android malware. This paper introduces PacDroid, a lightweight Android malware detection model that combines Android permissions, Intent Actions, and Category features to train the detection model. The feature selection phase integrates an advanced algorithm based on Gini importance, also known as Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI). This method evaluates and ranks features, selecting the most relevant ones to construct a more streamlined and effective model, thereby mitigating overfitting and enhancing generalization. The algorithm efficiently reduces the feature set size by 85\% and cuts training time up to 90\%, significantly enhancing model performance. We trained and evaluated Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, including Random Forests and XGBoost, on two benchmark datasets, CCCS-CIC and CIC-MalDroid, comprising 88,000 samples. The proposed model achieves 95.81\% accuracy without feature selection and 96.75\% accuracy with feature selection, outperforming existing methodologies.},

  abstract = {Preventing the spread of Domain Name System (DNS) tunnelling and the use of automation infrastructure is one of the key problems that the idea of a contemporary smart OSN (online social network) must address. The proposed technique focuses on online social network automation attacks (OSNAA) based on smart social network devices (SSND) energy consumption (Ecomp) analysis based on user’s selection modes (USM) for the detection of OSNAA and Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attacks. Automated opcode sequence analysis (OSA) is used to improve the accuracy of OSNAA detection and localise MiTM attacks. It analyses the performance of the SSND for MiTM attacks by localising suspicious automated tools on these devices with applicable accuracy and is based on the monitoring of energy consumption, which helps to analyse and categorise the behaviour of the SSND in the state of normal or in compromised conditions by the threat agents. The suggested technique enables high-efficiency detection of SSND threats, such as MiTM attacks, at a level of about 99.91\% and localization of suspicious automation tools on these machines with an accuracy of around 99.73\%.},

However, linear and non-linear ML-based classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial examples created to deceive the classifiers. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are architectures based on neural networks capable of successfully producing adversarial samples. In this study, we compare the performance of two GAN architectures based on either Transformer or Autoencoder networks in two distinct domains: Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) and mobile malware detection. We aim to evaluate their performance in terms of both effectiveness (i.e., the ability of the GAN-generated samples to reduce the detection rate of the targeted classifier) and efficiency (i.e., the capability of achieving the desired goal with fewer training epochs). Our findings reveal that the Transformer-based GAN outperforms the Autoencoder-based GAN, generating high-quality adversarial samples able to deceive both ML-based NIDS and ML-based malware detectors. Furthermore, in both scenarios, the Transformer-based architecture achieves a high deception efficacy through a reduced number of training epochs. This research sheds light on the relevance of GAN architectures, particularly Transformer-based models, and the need to consider samples produced by this architecture for improving the robustness of ML-based security solutions.},

  abstract = {The popularity of Android OS is largely credited to massive number of apps, and many app developers are involved in this ecosystem. On the other hand, various vulnerabilities are introduced into apps by developers carelessly, bringing security risks to users. To facilitate secure development and avoid common API misuses, Google provides a series of security guidelines and development practices for developers on official developer community websites. However, the adoption rate of these security guidelines in the real-world has not been systematically evaluated. In this work, through large-scale app measurement (108,091 apps from Google Play) and analysis, we investigated whether app developers follow the official Android security guidelines and the possible reasons behind it. In practice, we selected nine guidelines and mapped them to four OWASP MASVS control groups ( MASVS-STORAGE , MASVS-NETWORK , MASVS-PLATFORM , and MASVS-CODE ) as representatives, covering: (1) sensitive data storage; (2) validation check for file paths; (3) network security measures; (4) custom permission protection; (5) webview objects usage; (6) intent vulnerability; (7) secure file creation modes; (8) hardware ID usage; (9) man-in-the-middle attacks. We also designed the corresponding detection strategies to identify violations of the guidelines. The results show that most developers (> 90\%) comply with Guidelines 1 and 7.

  abstract = {Since Android is the popular mobile operating system worldwide, malicious attackers seek out Android smartphones as targets. The Android malware can be identified through a number of established detection techniques. However, the issues presented by modern malware cannot be met by traditional signature or heuristic-based malware detection methods. Previous research suggests that machine-learning classifiers can be utilised to analyse permissions, making it possible to differentiate between malicious and benign applications on the Android platform. There exist machine-learning methods that utilise permission-based attributes to build models for the detection of malware on Android devices. Nevertheless, the performance of these detection methods is dependent on the raw or feature datasets. Android malware research frequently faces a major obstacle due to the lack of adequate and up-to-date raw malware datasets. In this paper, we put forward a systematic approach to generate an Android permission-based dataset using static analysis. To create the dataset, we collect recent raw malware samples (APK files) and focus on the reverse engineering approach and permission-based features extraction. We also conduct a thorough feature analysis to determine the important Android permissions and present a machine-learning-based Android malware detection mechanism. The experimental result of our study demonstrates that with just 48 features, the random forest classifier-based Android malware detection model obtains the best accuracy of 97.5\%.},

To simplify data representation and reduce pre-processing workload, the study proposes the function-as-sentence approach. The MLP, OneDNN, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM algorithms were trained using this approach with the SOSP and NDSS18 binary datasets, and their results were compared. The aforementioned datasets contain buffer error vulnerabilities (CWE-119) and resource management error vulnerabilities (CWE-399). Our results are as successful as the studies in the literature. The system achieved the best performance using Bi-LSTM, with F1 score of 82.4\%. Additionally, AUC score of 93.0\% was acquired, which is the best in the literature. The study concluded by producing cyber threat intelligence using closed source software. Shareable intelligence was produced in an average of 0.1 s, excluding the detection process.

To address this problem, our research introduces a Time-Aware Machine Learning (TAML) framework specifically designed for Android malware detection. Our framework extracts the best time-correlated features and then it builds time-aware and time-agnostic machine learning (ML) models. The ML models are trained on the KronoDroid dataset, which contains more than 41,000 benign Android apps and more than 36,000 malicious apps developed between 2008 to 2020. Our experimental evaluation revealed that the Last Modification Date ‘LastModDate’ feature is a critical variable for time-aware classification. Moreover, our empirical analysis reveals that real-device detection outperforms emulator-based detection. Impressively, the time-correlated features boosts the detection performance and achieving an outstanding 99.98\% F1 score in a time-agnostic setting. In addition, on each year, our time-aware experiments outperformed the traditional ML detection models. Our time-aware classifier achieved a 91\% F1 score on average and a maximum F1 score of 99\% of yearly chunk experiments over 12 years.

The abuse of mobile device permissions is prone to the risk of privacy leakage. The existing detection technology can detect the inconsistency between the declared authority and the actual use authority. But using the third-party privacy policy as the analysis basis for SDK permissions will result in a large set of extracted declaration permissions, which will lead to identifying risky applications as normal applications during consistency comparison. The prevailing approach involves utilizing models based on TextCNN to extract information from privacy policies. However, the training of TextCNN relies on large-scale annotated datasets, leading to high costs. This paper uses BERT as the word vector extraction model to obtain private phrases from the privacy policy. And then we use cosine similarity to automatically filter permission phrase samples, reducing the workload of manual labeling. On the other hand, existing methods do not support the analysis of Chinese privacy policies. In order to solve the problem of consistency judgment between Chinese privacy policy and permission usage, we implement a BERT-based Android privacy policy and permission usage consistency analysis engine. The engine first uses static analysis to obtain the permission list of Android applications, and then combines the BERT model to achieve consistency analysis. After functional and speed testing, we found that the engine can successfully run the consistency analysis function of Chinese declaration permissions and usage permissions, and it is better than the existing detection methods.},

However, it has been associated with several problems, including complexity, support for unconstrained communication, and difficulties for developers to understand. These issues have led to numerous security vulnerabilities in Android ICC. While existing research has focused on specific subsets of these vulnerabilities, it lacks comprehensive and scalable modeling of app specifications and interactions, which limits the precision of analysis. To tackle these problems, we introduce VAnDroid3, a Model-Driven Reverse Engineering (MDRE) framework. VAnDroid3 utilizes purposeful model-based representations to enhance the comprehension of apps and their interactions. We have made significant extensions to our previous work, which include the identification of six prominent ICC vulnerabilities and the consideration of both Intent and Data sharing mechanisms that facilitate ICCs. By employing MDRE techniques to create more efficient and accurate domain-specific models from apps, VAnDroid3 enables the analysis of ICC vulnerabilities on intra- and inter-app communication levels. We have implemented VAnDroid3 as an Eclipse-based tool and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its correctness, scalability, and run-time performance. Additionally, we compared VAnDroid3 with state-of-the-art tools. The results substantiate VAnDroid3 as a promising framework for revealing Android inter-app ICC security issues.},

  abstract = {The proxy pattern is a well-known design pattern with numerous use cases in several sectors of the software industry (e.g., network applications, microservices, and IoT). As such, the use of the proxy pattern is also a common approach in the development of complex decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. A contract that implements the proxy pattern (proxy contract) acts as a layer between the clients and the target contract, enabling greater flexibility (e.g., data validation checks) and upgradeability (e.g., online smart contract replacement with zero downtime) in DApp development. Despite the importance of proxy contracts, little is known about (i) how their prevalence changed over time, (ii) the ways in which developers integrate proxies in the design of DApps, and (iii) what proxy types are being most commonly leveraged by developers. In this paper, we present a large-scale exploratory study on the use of the proxy pattern in Ethereum. We analyze a dataset of all Ethereum smart contracts as of Sep. 2022 containing 50M smart contracts and 1.6B transactions, and apply both quantitative and qualitative methods in order to (i) determine the prevalence of proxy contracts, (ii) understand the ways they are deployed and integrated into applications, and (iii) uncover the prevalence of different types of proxy contracts. Our findings reveal that 14.2\% of all deployed smart contracts are proxy contracts. We show that proxy contracts are being more actively used than non-proxy contracts. Also, the usage of proxy contracts in various contexts, transactions involving proxy contracts, and adoption of proxy contracts by users have shown an upward trend over time, peaking at the end of our study period. They are either deployed through off-chain scripts or on-chain factory contracts, with the former and latter being employed in 39.1\% and 60.9\% of identified usage contexts in turn. We found that while the majority (67.8\%) of proxies act as an interceptor, 32.2\% enables upgradeability. Proxy contracts are typically (79\%) implemented based on known reference implementations with 29.4\% being of type ERC-1167, a class of proxies that aims to cheaply reuse and clone contracts’ functionality. Our evaluation shows that our proposed behavioral proxy detection method has a precision and recall of 100\% in detecting active proxies. Finally, we derive a set of practical recommendations for developers and introduce open research questions to guide future research on the topic.},

  abstract = {With the development of science and technology, the number of smartphones has increased dramatically. This also exposes Android-based smartphones to an increasing number of malware attacks. Currently, feature extraction schemes based on sensitive API calls have become mainstream in malware detection. However, such an approach can only capture the behavior of malware when the API is called, but it cannot detect malicious behavior implemented through other means. In the real world, attackers often use the Inter-Component Communication (ICC) mechanism to hide and conceal their malicious intent. In this paper, we propose a novel malware detection framework (named ADACapsNet). This framework first employs an entropy-based approach to extract sensitive API features to reflect the behavior patterns of malware and then captures the information flow across components by monitoring the ICC interactions in the Android systems. We transform sensitive API calls and ICC features into vector representations that are used as inputs to the learning model. Moreover, we propose an adaptive capsule network to mine deep program semantics, which uses an adaptive factor to dynamically assign weights for features, enhancing the model’s ability to focus on relevant features and capture complex spatial relationships. We conducted a number of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADACapsNet in detecting malware. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust against malware attacks.},

  abstract = {Function signature plays an important role in binary analysis and security enhancement, with typical examples in bug finding and control-flow integrity enforcement. However, recovery of function signatures by static binary analysis is challenging since crucial information vital for such recovery is stripped off during compilation. Although function signature recovery using deep learning (DL) is proposed in an effort to handle such challenges, the reported accuracy is low for binaries compiled with optimizations. In this paper, we first perform a systematic study to quantify the extent to which compiler optimizations (negatively) impact the accuracy of existing DL techniques based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for function signature recovery. Our experiments show that the state-of-the-art DL technique has its accuracy dropped from 98.7\% to 87.7\% when training and testing optimized binaries. We further investigate the type of instructions that existing RNN model deems most important in inferring function signatures with the help of saliency map. The results show that existing RNN model mistakenly considers non-argument-accessing instructions to infer the number of arguments, especially when dealing with optimized binaries. Finally, we identify specific weaknesses in such existing approaches and propose an enhanced DL approach named ReSIL to incorporate compiler-optimization-specific domain knowledge into the learning process. Our experimental results show that ReSIL significantly improves the accuracy and F1 score in inferring function signatures, e.g., with accuracy in inferring the number of arguments for callees compiled with optimization flag O1 from 84.83\% to 92.68\%. Meanwhile, ReSIL correctly considers the argument-accessing instructions as the most important ones to perform the inferencing. We also demonstrate security implications of ReSIL in Control-Flow Integrity enforcement in stopping potential Counterfeit Object-Oriented Programming (COOP) attacks.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the last years, the increasing vehicular technology has led to a surge in cybersecurity attacks, particularly regarding connected vehicles and their vulnerable infotainment systems. This paper explores the vulnerabilities within an In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) system firmware, focusing on the Gen5W\_L multimedia device utilized in Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis vehicles. Leveraging reverse engineering techniques, the study uncovers several security issues within the firmware, allowing for the creation and installation of custom firmware. The paper introduces Chimaera, a reverse engineering attack targeting the IVI system firmware, which exploits a vulnerability introduced by statically compiling the mbedtls library. After a reverse engineering analysis and injecting malicious assembly code directly in the IVI firmware, the attack enables the extraction of sensitive information from the firmware files like the cryptographic keys to install a customized firmware. The research shows that exploiting these vulnerabilities facilitates the installation of insecure firmware, granting attackers unauthorized access to vehicle functionalities. This includes the possibility to inject CAN bus messages, potentially compromising critical vehicle systems such as radio controls and safety features. The findings underscore the need for robust cybersecurity measures within automotive systems and highlight the significance of vulnerability assessment to mitigate security risks in connected vehicles.},

  abstract = {Rapid growth in the variety and quantity of apps makes it difficult for users to protect their privacy, although existing regulations have been introduced and the Android ecosystem is constantly being improved, there are still violations as privacy policies may not fully comply with regulations, and app behavior may not be fully consistent with privacy policies. To solve such issues, this paper proposes an automated method called VioDroid-Finder aiming at the evaluation of compliance and consistency for Android apps. We first study existing common regulations and conclude the privacy policy content into 7 aspects (i.e., privacy categories), for privacy policies, different compliance rules are required to be complied with in each privacy category. Secondly, we present a policy structure parser model based on the structure extraction/rebuilding method (which can convert the unstructured text to an XML tree) and subtitle similarity calculation algorithm. Thirdly, we propose a violation analyzer using the BERT model to classify each sentence in the privacy policy, we collect existing issues and combine them with manual observations to define 6 types of violations and detect them based on classification results. Then, we propose an inconsistency analyzer that converts permissions, APIs, and GUI into a set of personal information based on static analysis, inconsistencies are detected by comparing that set with personal information declared in the privacy policy. Finally, we evaluate 600 Chinese apps using the proposed method, from which we detect many violations and inconsistencies reflecting the current widespread privacy violation issues.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of malware variants has shown a steep increase, attributed to their enhanced sophistication and the utilization of the latest technologies. This constitutes a severe menace to smart gadgets and IT infrastructure. Malware visualization has emerged as an exceptionally attractive technique, primarily because it obviates the need for disassembly or code execution. In this approach, malicious executables are transformed into visual representations resembling images. This visual representation allows for the extraction of textural features using the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) technique. Subsequently, classification models are constructed using ResNet50, VGG16, and customized models tailored to the specific task. These model undergoes extensive evaluation through two benchmark datasets: the MalImg dataset (consisting of 9,342 instances of malware across 25 families) and the Malware Classification Challenge dataset (BIG2015) (with 10,868 labeled malware instances across nine families). Additionally, the model is validated on a self-made dataset, which we named Malhub, consisting of 26,452 executables comprising 20 families. Furthermore, we implemented a white-box adversarial attack using additive noise (Gaussian, Local Variable, Poisson, Salt and Pepper, Speckle). We observed an F1 score in the range of 0.992 \\(-\\) 0.993 for MalImg, 0.874 \\(-\\) 0.878 for BIG2015, and 0.014 \\(-\\) 0.992 for Malhub dataset. This proves that efforts are required to tune machine learning models to detect adversarial examples.},

A variety of malware has taken over the market in recent times. This sophisticated malware uses different obfuscation and mutation techniques to deceive the detectors. Obfuscation and mutation attacks are technique variations in which the attacker uses java-reflection techniques and encryption to manipulate the malicious applications and force the classifier to do misclassification. Despite its positive use, malware experts have also used this technique to misguide classifiers. The obfuscated malware is difficult to tackle due to the complexity of there structure and behavior. A fresh look is needed at the available datasets and features used especially for Android obfuscated malware analysis. We investigate and provide a concise account of obfuscated malware detection techniques. We evaluate the importance and effectiveness of obfuscation for Android malware analysis by investigating the techniques, datasets, and feature sets used in the literature. We report supervised learning as more popular for analysis. The paper provides details on the use of datasets such as Debian, genome, Adrozoo, and CIC as the most commonly used in literature. We also investigate certain features, mostly static, considered for analysis and highlight the use of unconventional techniques, such as unsupervised learning and graph theory.},

  abstract = {Ethereum is the most widely used open-source public chain project, with smart contracts serving as the pattern for developing decentralized applications. The prevalence of attacks against smart contracts has increased in recent years due to the attached amounts of high-value cryptocurrency. Various attacks against smart contracts have caused significant financial losses, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. As manual auditing of smart contracts is time-consuming and costly, automatic detection of vulnerabilities is crucial. Existing work does not dig deeper into contextual information contained in the program, which suffers from the difficulty of covering paths with more complex conditions. In this paper, we propose Ethchecker, a smart contract vulnerability detection tool which combines fuzzing and symbolic execution techniques together. Particularly, we propose an analysis module to extract static information from smart contracts. Besides, the tool introduces a genetic algorithm to enlarge code coverage, while considering the contextual information of the code. The results of the experiment show that in terms of F1-score for vulnerability detection, Ethchecker outperforms sFuzz by an average of 21.89\% and outperforms Mythril by an average of 12.5\%. Furthermore, in the comparison experiments on a dataset consisting of 1000 long smart contract codes (comprising over 3000 instructions), the proposed algorithm can improve the code coverage by 18.56\% compared to the random fuzzing algorithm. In addition, we also used Ethchecker to test against 8922 randomly crawled real-world smart contracts. The result demonstrates the stability of this tool.},

  abstract = {The first Android-ready “G1” phone debuted in late October 2008. Since then, the growth of Android malware has been explosive, analogous to the rise in the popularity of Android. The major positive aspect of Android is its open-source nature, which empowers app developers to expand their work. However, authors with malicious intentions pose grave threats to users. In the presence of such threats, Android malware detection is the need of an hour. Consequently, researchers have proposed various techniques involving static, dynamic, and hybrid analysis to address such threats to numerous features in the last decade. However, the feature that most researchers have extensively used to perform malware analysis and detection in Android security is Android permission. Hence, to provide a clarified overview of the latest and past work done in Android malware analysis and detection, we perform a comprehensive literature review using permissions as a central feature or in combination with other components by collecting and analyzing 205 studies from 2009 to 2023. We extracted information such as the choice opted by researchers between analysis or detection, techniques used to select or rank the permissions feature set, features used along with permissions, detection models employed, malware datasets used by researchers, and limitations and challenges in the field of Android malware detection to propose some future research directions. In addition, on the basis of the information extracted, we answer the six research questions designed considering the above factors.},

  abstract = {Android malware has been growing in scale and complexity, spurred by the unabated uptake of smartphones worldwide. Millions of malicious Android applications have been detected in the past few years, posing severe threats like system damage, information leakage, etc. This calls for novel approaches to mitigate the growing threat of Android malware. Among various detection schemes, permission and intent-based ones have been widely proposed in the literature. However, many permissions and intents patterns are similar in normal and malware datasets. Such high similarity in both datasets’ permissions and intents patterns motivates us to rank them to find the distinguishing features. Hence, we have proposed a novel Android malware detection system named IPAnalyzer that first ranks the permissions and intents with a frequency-based Chi-square test. Then, the system applies a novel detection algorithm that combines ranked permissions and intents and involves various machine learning and deep learning classifiers. As a result, the proposed system gives the best set of permissions and intents with higher detection accuracy as an output. The experimental results highlight that our proposed approach can effectively detect Android malware with 98.49\% detection accuracy, achieved with the combination of the top six permissions and top six intents. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed system with the Chi-square ranking is better than other statistical tests like Mutual Information and Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Moreover, the proposed model can detect Android malware with better accuracy and less number of features than various state-of-the-art techniques for Android malware detection.},

  abstract = {Smart contract is a new paradigm for the decentralized software system, which plays an important and key role in Blockchain-based application. The vulnerabilities in smart contracts are unacceptable, and some of which have caused significant economic losses. The machine learning, especially deep learning, is a very promising and potential approach to vulnerability detecting for smart contracts. At present, deep learning-based vulnerability detection methods have low accuracy, time-consuming, and too small application range. For dealing with these, we propose a novel deep learning-based vulnerability detection framework for smart contracts at opcode level, named as DL4SC. It orthogonally combines the Transformer encoder and CNN (convolutional neural networks) to detect vulnerabilities of smart contracts for the first time, and firstly exploit SSA (sparrow search algorithm) to automatically search model hyperparameters for vulnerability detection. We implement the framework DL4SC on deep learning platform Pytorch with Python, and compare it with existing works on the three public datasets and one dataset we collect. The experiment results show that DL4SC can accurately detect vulnerabilities of smart contracts, and performs better than state-of-the-art works for detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The accuracy and F1-score of DL4SC are 95.29\% and 95.68\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Mixed-mode oscillations (abbreviated as MMOs) belong to a typical kind of fast/slow dynamical behavior, and how to investigate the mechanism is an important problem in nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we explore the MMOs induced by the bifurcation delay phenomenon and twist of the trajectories in space based on a coupled system consisting of a Van der Pol system and a Duffing oscillator with two potential wells. Regarding the low-frequency external excitation as a generalized state variable, we obtain the traditional fast and slow subsystems. Appling the equilibrium analysis and bifurcation theory, the stability critical conditions of the equilibrium and the generation conditions of fold and Hopf bifurcation are also presented. To analyze the critical conditions clearly, the two-parameter bifurcation and one-parameter bifurcation diagrams are performed by using numerical simulation method. The bifurcation characteristics are studied, especially the effects of parameter δ on the bifurcation structures. We find that the fast subsystem performs different dynamical behaviors such as fold bifurcation of limit cycles, period-doubling bifurcations, inverse-period-doubling bifurcations and chaos, when parameter δ is taken at different values. By using phase diagrams, time series, maximum Lyapunov exponent diagrams, three-dimensional phase diagrams and superimposed diagrams, the mechanisms of the MMOs are investigated numerically in detail. The Hopf bifurcation delay can lead the trajectories to arrive at the vector fields of the equilibrium point and limit cycles. In addition, the chaotic behaviors can be found on the route of period doubling, which lead to the chaotic spiking-state-oscillations types. Our findings are helpful to understand the generation of the MMOs and intensify the understanding of some special dynamical behaviors on the MMOs.},

Addressing the current issues of insufficient accuracy and efficiency in malicious code classification methods based on deep learning, this paper introduces a detection strategy for malicious code, uniting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. This approach utilizes deep neural architecture, incorporating a novel fusion module to reparametrize the structure, which mitigates memory access costs by eliminating residual connections within the network. Simultaneously, overparametrization during linear training time and significant kernel convolution techniques are employed to enhance network precision. In the data preprocessing stage, a pixel-based image size normalization algorithm and data augmentation techniques are utilized to remedy the loss of texture information in the malicious code image scaling process and class imbalance in the dataset, thereby enhancing essential feature expression and alleviating model overfitting.

  abstract = {Abstract Blockchain programs (also known as smart contracts) manage valuable assets like cryptocurrencies and tokens, and implement protocols in domains like decentralized finance (DeFi) and supply-chain management. These types of applications require a high level of security that is hard to achieve due to the transparency of public blockchains. Numerous tools support developers and auditors in the task of detecting weaknesses. As a young technology, blockchains and utilities evolve fast, making it challenging for tools and developers to keep up with the pace. In this work, we study the robustness of code analysis tools and the evolution of weakness detection on a dataset representing six years of blockchain activity. We focus on Ethereum as the crypto ecosystem with the largest number of developers and deployed programs. We investigate the behavior of single tools as well as the agreement of several tools addressing similar weaknesses. Our study is the first that is based on the entire body of deployed bytecode on Ethereum’s main chain. We achieve this coverage by considering bytecodes as equivalent if they share the same skeleton. The skeleton of a bytecode is obtained by omitting functionally irrelevant parts. This reduces the 48 million contracts deployed on Ethereum up to January 2022 to 248 328 contracts with distinct skeletons. For bulk execution, we utilize the open-source framework SmartBugs that facilitates the analysis of Solidity smart contracts, and enhance it to accept also bytecode as the only input. Moreover, we integrate six further tools for bytecode analysis. The execution of the 12 tools included in our study on the dataset took 30 CPU years. While the tools report a total of 1 307 486 potential weaknesses, we observe a decrease in reported weaknesses over time, as well as a degradation of tools to varying degrees.},

  abstract = {Malware writers, with the aim to elude the current detection mechanism implemented by commercial and free anti-malware, are finding new ways to develop new aggressive attack paradigms. Current anti-malware basically suffer about the following limitations: the first one is that they are not able to detect zero-day malware: as a matter of fact, to mark an application as malware they need to know the malicious payload signature. With regard to the second limitation, they are able to scan only one application at a time: this is the reason why a type of malware characterized by the colluding attack, where the malicious behaviour is divided between several applications, can never be detected. To demonstrate the ineffectiveness of current anti-malware in detecting colluding attacks, in this paper we design a method aimed to automatically inject a malicious payload in two or more different Android applications. We implemented the proposed method into a framework that we called Picker Blinder . In a nutshell, Picker Blinder is able to inject a collusive malicious payload exploiting two different channels (i.e., SharedPreferences and Sockets), allowing the attacker to catch sensitive and private information stored into the infected device. We perform an experimental analysis by submitting 398 colluding applications to different 79 anti-malware, by showing that current detection mechanisms are not able to detect this kind of threat.},

  abstract = {To avoid the human bias introduced by numerical statistical features and overcome difficulty in cross platform and optimization detection methods, this paper proposes a binary code similarity detection method based on semantic representation generated from deep learning models. This method uses the intermediate representation to eliminate the differences in syntax caused by compilation options. The feature vector of basic block with context semantic information is generated through natural language processing model, and the attention mechanism is introduced into the graph embedding neural network to realize the accurate construction of function features. The results show that this method has better results in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 value compared to advanced technologies in this field.},

Users post questions and mark them with the topic that they are related to (known as tags). Post this, users always expect quick answers/solutions from known and reliable sources. However, a large number of posted questions remain unanswered due to erroneous and huge number of tags. In our system, we propose an automated method to generate these tags using machine learning and deep learning techniques. This mainly helps in standardizing the tag content for similar questions and the total number of tags that the system needs to deal with. These tags can be generated from the content of the question provided by the user. In addition to this, for questionnaire forums related to programming questions like StackOverflow and StackExchange, our system aims to use the code snippets provided by the user to detect some common software vulnerabilities using deep learning techniques. Software vulnerabilities are weaknesses in software that may be exploited by malicious individuals. These vulnerabilities can arise from coding errors, flaws in design, or inadequate security measures, and can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or system availability. Detection of these vulnerabilities beforehand will benefit the user and prevent any sort of security threats in their system.},

  abstract = {Executable packing is a well-known problematic especially in the field of malware analysis. It often consists in applying compression or encryption to a binary file and embedding a stub for reversing these transformations at runtime. This way, the packed executable is more difficult to reverse-engineer and/or is obfuscated, which is effective for evading static detection techniques. Many detection approaches, including machine learning, have been proposed in the literature so far, but most studies rely on questionable ground truths and do not provide any open implementation, making the comparison of state-of-the-art solutions tedious. We thus think that first solving the issue of repeatability shall help to compare existing executable packing static detection techniques. Given this challenge, we propose an experimental toolkit, named Packing Box, that leverages automation and containerization in an open source platform that brings a unified solution to the research community. We present our engineering approach for designing and implementing our solution. We then showcase it with a few basic experiments, including a performance evaluation of open source static packing detectors and training a model with machine learning pipeline automation. This introduces the toolset that will be used in further studies.},

Existing information flow tracking systems face difficulties in detecting these breaches due to two main challenges: the multi-layered Android platform using different programming languages (Java and C/C++), and the complex, event-driven execution flow of Android apps that complicates tracking, especially across these language barriers. Our system, DryJIN, addresses this by effectively tracking information flow within and across both Java and native modules. Utilizing symbolic execution for native code data flows and integrating it with Java data flows, DryJIN enhances existing static analysis techniques (Argus-SAF, JuCify, and FlowDroid) to cover previously unaddressed information flow patterns. We validated DryJIN ’s effectiveness through a comprehensive evaluation on over 168k apps, including malware and real-world apps, demonstrating its superiority over current state-of-the-art methods.},

To address this limitation, we carried out an extensive analysis of features to identify the key Android permissions utilized by colluding app-pairs. We propose an approach to classify collusive app-pairs using the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Our results provide valuable insights into the relationship between specific Android permission sets and the malicious activities performed by colluding app-pairs. We identified 12 permissions as the most important features contributing to the classification of collusive app-pairs. We also identified 4 distinct clusters of colluding Android app-pairs.},

  abstract = {To protect Android applications from reverse engineering, more and more adversarial analysis techniques are proposed, such as packing, encryption, obfuscation, etc. As one of the most advanced techniques for obfuscation, code virtualization at the dex bytecode level has evolved from hiding meta information to protect executable instructions. However, previous approaches are proved to have a certain degree of vulnerability at the directive opcode replacement. In this paper, we present DynVMDroid, a reinforcement system based on code virtualization to protect Android applications from reverse engineering. DynVMDroid consists of two components, a reinforcement engine and a custom runtime environment. The reinforcement engine disrupts the inherent structural order and extends the length of the original instructions from key methods, converting them into virtual code in Android applications. The custom runtime environment dynamically recovering the virtual instructions to ensure the protected application work properly. To verify its performance and compatibility, we have applied DynVMDroid to 10 applications. In addition, various attack methods have been adopted on the protected applications to validate their security. Our experimental results show that the applications protected by DynVMDroid perform correctly and effectively against common reverse analysis techniques with acceptable performance losses.},

  abstract = {With the development of the mobile Internet, mobile devices have been extensively promoted and popularized. Android, as the current popular mobile intelligent operating system, has encountered problems such as the explosive growth of Android malware while bringing convenience to users. The traditional Android malware detection methods have some problems, such as low detection accuracy and difficulty in detecting unknown malware. This paper proposes an Android malware detection method named Android malware detection method based on graph convolutional neural network (AGCN) based on the graph convolutional network (GCN) to solve the above problems. Firstly, we divide the Android software datasets according to family and software features and construct a directed network topology graph. At the same time, the permission features of APK files are extracted and vectorized. Then, we use GCN to learn the features of Android APK files… Finally, we compare AGCN with a multilayer perceptron (MLP), long and short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, bi-directional long and short-term memory (bi-LSTM) neural network, and deep confidence neural network (DCNN) for experiments. Experimental results show that the model has an accuracy of 98.55\% for malware detection, demonstrating the detection method’s effectiveness.},

  abstract = {In the Android ecosystem, malware detection is still a nontrivial task. Existing works have recently applied convolution neural networks (CNNs) for detecting Android malwares. However, data drift and class imbalance are still open problems in this field. The distribution of malware data may vary significantly if data are represented by unstable features, leading to data drift problems. The model may not be able to effectively detect malwares on the future data. In addition, the class imbalance may degrade a model on identifying a specific type of malwares with fewer training samples. To handle both of the two problems, this paper presents a new Android malware detection framework. Specifically, we devise a data distribution-aware feature learning framework for learning features with a stable distribution to handle data drift. We further devise a new loss function for CNN to handle the class imbalance problem. Using our loss function, this model can reinforcement learn the minority class samples and hard samples. The experimental results on the real datasets revealed that our method outperforms existing works for Android malware detection on the datasets with data drift and class imbalance problems.},

Furthermore, binaries can behave in “weird” ways which have no counterpart in assembly languages, e.g., instructions may overlap, or use other instructions as data. Yet, the general consensus is that, for a large part of production binaries, disassembly works sufficiently well for the use cases at hand. This paper aims to address the question: for which binaries is disassembly decidable? For which binaries can disassembly become decidable if an external oracle, e.g., provides the set of instruction addresses, or resolves indirections? We present a set of five theorems on decidability of disassembly; each theorem corresponding to a use case. All five theorems are accompanied by a proof of correctness based on bisimilarity between the input binary and the output assembly program, and have been formalized in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover.},

So, malware authors focus on developing android malicious applications. In this study, a malware detection technique that is suitable for Android smart devices is proposed. It is a static technique based on visualization of android applications. In this proposed method, android applications are converted into grayscale images. Furthermore, the image’s texture features are retrieved using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local binary pattern (LBP) techniques. Then feature filtration is performed using Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) to reduce the feature set. The number of extracted features is reduced to thirteen by performing feature filtration after feature extraction. It is observed that when the classification is applied to selected features, better results are obtained from filtered features rather than applying classification on features extracted through GLCM or LBP alone. This technique also reduced the prediction time of the detection system due to the small number of features.},

  abstract = {Function recognition is one of the most critical tasks in binary analysis and reverse engineering. However, the recognition of inline functions still remains challenging. This is mainly due to two factors. Firstly, in binaries, there exist no expert patterns, e.g., prologue/epilogue instructions, for inline functions. Secondly, instruction reordering introduced by compiler optimization makes the address space of the instruction from the same inline function discontinuous. The address space of an inline function is often mingled with that of regular functions. This paper proposes FSmell, a graph theory based function recognition framework that specifically targets inline functions. FSmell introduces Instruction Topology Graph (ITG) to represent the data flow dependencies for instructions in a basic block. With the help of ITG, the problem of distinguishing inline instructions from caller instructions is transformed into the graph connectivity problem, which is solved by computing the minimum vertex separator. We have applied FSmell to analyze 78 binaries compiled by GCC and CLANG with 3 different optimization levels. Of the 205,890 inline functions in the 78 binaries, FSmell reports 76,777, with a precision of 67.5\%, and a recall of 39.2\%. With the help of FSmell, 50\% of the vulnerabilities missed by other methods are detected and located.},

Our analysis has been applied to 125 Android mobile applications available on the Google Play Store. We identify a set of vulnerabilities and further validate these vulnerabilities with real-world vehicles. We show that 70\% of the apps have vulnerabilities that can lead to private information leakage, property theft, and direct risk while driving. For instance, 18 apps could connect to open OBD dongles without requiring any authentication, accept arbitrary CAN commands as inputs from the (potentially malicious) user, and deliver the commands to the CAN bus without any validation.

By analyzing 18 mobile facial recognition libraries, we reveal the protocol design and implementation intricacies of various systems. The investigation leads to the discovery of several system security issues in over half of the libraries, predominantly linked to the liveness detection module.

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate using obfuscation as a security-through-obscurity approach to hide app code vulnerabilities in Android apps. Obfuscation refers to a set of techniques that change the syntax of the code but preserve its semantics. This way, the app maintains the same runtime behavior, but the obfuscated code is hardly readable to a human being. Here, we aim to empirically assess whether obfuscation could also negatively affect the vulnerability detection rate of SAST (i.e., Static Application Security Testing) tools. Such tools automatically reverse-engineer the app and look for vulnerability patterns in the code according to proper heuristics. Our findings show that obfuscation reduces the detection rate of SAST tools, suggesting that investigating novel and vulnerability-focused obfuscation techniques in the future may reduce the probability of an attacker detecting vulnerabilities in obfuscated app code, both manually (due to unreadability) and automatically (by deceiving SAST tools).},

  abstract = {Directed Greybox Fuzzing has proven effective in vulnerability detection areas such as bug reproduction and patch testing. However, existing directed fuzzers are often difficult to customize, lack modularity and have limited binary support. This constrains their usability on complex software or when the source code is unavailable; a challenge encountered when fuzzing embedded systems. This article addresses these limitations by introducing the Directed Fuzzing Toolkit (DRIFT) as a platform for directed fuzzing within the modular framework LibAFL. DRIFT modularizes techniques from the state-of-the-art directed fuzzer AFLGo and adapts them for binary applications thereby augmenting LibAFL’s highly customizable fuzzers with directed fuzzing capabilities. Additionally, by leveraging Ghidra’s analysis, DRIFT achieves architecture agnostic static analysis, opening doors for DGF to tackle previously challenging scenarios. Our evaluation of DRIFT shows a 90\% correlation in static analysis metrics over binary compared to its source-code counterpart. Fuzzing performance was also notable despite operating over emulation. In benchmarks, DRIFT’s performance exceeds the original fuzzer with up to doubled bug discovery rates and 9–40 \\(\\times \\) faster exploitation times of target bugs. These results are attributed to the toolkit’s modular design and its integration with LibAFL. Additionally, DRIFT includes a profiling platform for DGF metrics and is incorporated with the Magma benchmark. Together, these features position DRIFT as a practical advancement in directed fuzzing within LibAFL.},

Due to the popularity of this operating system, there have been many attackers that have tried to exploit the weaknesses of this system. In the CVE database, as of 2023, there have been over 8000 exploits discovered on different devices with the Android operating system. With every update of the operating system, Android developers try to fix the discovered bugs that lead to attacks. However, by unawareness of the average Android user, many smartphones aren’t updated to use the newest version of the Android operating system, which leads to them being targets of many attacks. Research has shown there haven’t been many attempts to implement an educational tool to inform of the different kinds of attacks on mobile devices, especially ones that focus on the specifics of the Android devices. In this paper we present a system for education that strives to focus on attacks that could happen on Android devices, with a special focus on remote attacks. This will be shown with a couple of different attack methods, that exploit different weaknesses of the Android operating system. The final product of this research is an educational tool that is ready for use in the course Advanced Network and System Security in the following semester.},

Android devices, with relatively lower security measures allowing installations from unknown sources, face notable malware prevalence, creating opportunities for cybercriminals to engage in illicit activities. To address this issue, numerous research studies have focused on harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop effective solutions. Notably, research utilizing the CICMalDroid2020 dataset has achieved promising results by employing Deep Learning and Machine Learning approaches for Android malware detection. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior studies utilizing this dataset have explored the potential of the Extra-Tree Machine Learning classifier. In our research, we endeavored to fill this gap by implementing the Extra Tree classifier in conjunction with cross-validation techniques. Additionally, we employed the SelectFrom-Model feature selection method to enhance the accuracy of malware detection. Through our investigation, we found that the ExtraTree classifier exhibited good performances, achieving an accuracy rate of 96.7\%.},

We propose a sound strategy for testing concurrent mobile applications by first extracting use cases that capture interleavings of behaviours of existing test cases for individual features. From these use cases, we generate test cases that are still sequential but exercise the execution of concurrent features. Our approach incorporates a dependency analysis to ensure a consistent execution order of test steps, avoiding incoherent sequences, like sending a message without establishing an internet connection. We introduce a conformance relation, \\(\\mathbf \{cspio\_\{q\}\}\\) , based on \\(\\textbf\{cspio\}\\) , but extended to consider quiescent behaviour (output absence) as in \\(\\textbf\{ioco\}\\) , a widely recognised conformance relation for formal software testing. We then optimise the strategy, which involves permuting test steps without the need to generate use cases but preserving soundness. We discuss tool support and conduct an empirical evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the overall strategy in terms of test coverage and bug detection. The results indicate that our approach yields higher coverage and potential bug detection compared to the set of tests generated by Motorola engineers.},

  abstract = {To provide a tamper-proof mechanism for mobile apps to check the integrity of the device and their own code/data, Android phone manufacturers have introduced Manufacturer-provided Android Remote Attestation (MARA) frameworks. The MARA framework helps an app conduct a series of integrity checks, signs the check results, and sends them to remote servers for a remote attestation. Nonetheless, we observe that real-world MARA frameworks often adopt two implementations of integrity check (hardware-based and software-based) for compatibility consideration, and this allows an attacker to easily conduct a downgrade attack to force the app to utilize the software-based integrity check and forge checking results, even if the Android device is able to employ hardware-supported remote attestation securely. We demonstrate our MARA bypass approach against MARA frameworks (i.e., Google SafetyNet and Huawei SafetyDetect ) on real Android devices, and design an automated measurement pipeline to analyze 35,245 popular Android apps, successfully attacking all 104 apps that use these MARA services, including well-known apps and games such as TikTok Lite , Huawei Wallet , and Pokémon GO .

The evaluation considers reachability as the property to be verified and checks the consistency of verification results, the improvement of verification efficiency, and the advantages of different toolchains when verifying reachability. The investigation shows that most programs keep consistent verification results after slicing and verifying programs with much code unrelated to the properties becomes faster when slicing is applied before verification. However, it is surprising that verification time for some programs can be significantly longer after slicing. We have investigated the reasons for such phenomenon concerning the features of these programs, and provide insightful conclusions obtained from using the slicing+verification approach.},

Reproducibility ensures that results can be confirmed by using the same dataset and software of previous papers. Reusability helps other researchers to build new approaches with distributed software artifacts. For researchers in the field of security of mobile platforms, ensuring reproducibility and reusability is difficult to implement. In particular for reusability, datasets of Android applications may contain recent applications that past analysis software cannot process. As a consequence, past software produced by researchers may be difficult to reuse, which endangers the reproducibility of research. This paper intends to explore the reusability of past software dedicated to static analysis of Android applications. We pursue the community effort that identified publications between 2011 and 2017 that perform static analysis of mobile applications and we propose a method for evaluating the reusability of the associated tools. We extensively evaluate the success or failure of these tools on a dataset containing Android applications that can have up to six years of distance from the original publication. We also measure the influence of some important characteristics of the application such as being a goodware or a malware or the application size. Our results show that 54.5\% of the evaluated tools are no longer usable and that the size of the bytecode and the min SDK version have the greatest influence on the reusability of tested tools.},

Since Android malware and the operating system continue to evolve, designing resilient malware detection techniques that can adapt over time without frequent modifications or retraining presents a significant challenge. Nonetheless, malware authors continuously update their sample characteristics to evade detection, leading to changes in data distribution that directly impact the detection performance of machine learning models, a consideration largely absent in most academic work. In this study, we address the impact of this constant evolution by conducting a longitudinal evaluation. Our approach involves utilizing API call sequences extracted at different abstraction levels (e.g., package level, class level) by tracing the Call Graph structure to capture the order of API calls. We employ two well-established deep learning classifiers, CNN and RNN-LSTM, on a dataset comprising 80,000 Android apps. Through extensive experiments comparing API-level abstractions and classifiers, we aim to identify the most effective approach for real-world scenarios. The results of our empirical evaluation show that CNN offers better longitudinal performance than the RNN-LSTM.},

This work aims to solve the problem of lifting low-level language to sound high-level Intermediate Representation (IR) as a formal language translation problem, enabling automatic learning of binary lifting. Therefore, we propose a neural machine translation-based binary lifting framework named LEARNT with a parallel corpus generation method leveraging a compiler.

  abstract = {The proliferation of malware in the Android ecosystem poses significant security risks and financial losses for enterprises and developers. Malware constantly evolves, exhibiting dynamic behavior and complexity, thus making it challenging to develop robust defense mechanisms. Traditional methods, such as signature-based and battery-monitoring approaches, struggle to detect emerging malware variants effectively. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promising results in Android malware detection. However, most existing approaches focus on binary classification and need more insights into the model’s generality across different types of malware. This study presents a novel approach to address Android malware detection by integrating TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features into the call graph structure. By attributing each node in the call graph with TF-IDF-based feature vectors extracted from the opcode sequences of each method using an opcode list, we present a more thorough representation that encapsulates the complex traits of the malware samples. We employ state-of-the-art graph-based deep learning models to classify malware families, including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), SAGEConv, Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN). By incorporating high-level structural information from the call graphs and TF-IDF-based raw features, our approach aims to enhance the accuracy and generality of the malware detection models. We identify an optimal model for the Android malware family classification task through extensive evaluation and comparison of the above-mentioned models.

Instruction embedding maps the semantic information of instructions into fixed-dimensional vectors. However, the current instruction embedding approaches often neglect the operational requirements of resource-constrained environments typical of VANET. Moreover, the dependency on third-party disassembly tools for the extraction of instruction call graphs presents challenges related to runtime environment, thereby complicating the feasible application of instruction embedding techniques. To address these limitations, we propose a novel cross-architecture firmware instruction embedding model called Firm-Vehicle, specifically tailored for resource-constrained environments in VANET. Primarily, we devise a lightweight algorithm for extracting instruction call graphs, eliminating the reliance on third-party disassembly tools and improving the efficiency of call graphs extraction, thereby enhancing the instruction embedding model. Through evaluations and comparison with other approaches, Firm-Vehicle not only reduces the required time for instruction call graphs extraction but also enhances the stability of the instruction embedding model, enabling secure and efficient operation within the VANET environment.},

In this article, a crucial stage in software engineering, the feature extraction technique for effective software transplantation, is discussed. As hardware, operating systems, or other factors change, it is commonly necessary to move software from one environment to another. This process is known as “software transplanting.” It is vital to identify and extract the relevant software characteristics, which might be challenging given how complex software is, in order to carry out efficient software transplanting. On the other hand, the procedure to extract these attributes from the software might be time-consuming and need extensive understanding. We provide a feature extraction method that makes use of machine learning methods to extract beneficial components from software in order to tackle this problem. Our approach includes identifying essential software components, including variables, functions, and other elements. We next use these components to train our machine learning model to separate significant properties. We use a dataset of software applications to compare the results of our strategy to those obtained using manual feature extraction methods. Our results demonstrate that our technique effectively extracts crucial traits and can significantly reduce the time and effort required for successful software transplanting. Thus, by making software transplantation more effective and successful, the recommended feature extraction approach greatly advances the field of software engineering.},

  abstract = {Detecting malware poses significant challenges due to the evolving sophistication of malicious software. Conventional detection techniques like signature-based methods and behavioral analysis have experienced diminishing effectiveness. To address this, a groundbreaking deep learning framework called Decomposition Training and Classification Network (DTC-Net) is introduced in this work. DTC-Net consists of three phases: feature extraction utilizing the VGG16 backbone network, data simplification through class decomposition, and classification using fully connected layers. Furthermore, a class composition layer enhances the accuracy of final categorization. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed DTC-Net demonstrates impressive performance, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods. It achieves remarkable results, including an F1-score of 95.364\%, accuracy of 98.545\%, precision of 94.737\%, and recall of 96\%. This research showcases the effectiveness of DTC-Net as an integrated and comprehensive deep learning solution for accurate malware family classification.},

  abstract = {The smartphone location is the basis for a plethora of popular applications, such as traffic navigation, games, and geotagging. Since the user can manipulate the reported location, it is possible to compromise these applications with fake locations. These attacks generally have a limited impact, but this is changing with the increasing level of trust in the smartphone location. As a prominent example, recent transport e-ticketing applications perform financial transactions based on the assumption that the smartphone location represents that of the user. Unfortunately, this assumption leads to location-based attacks with direct financial implications. We present FreeRide , a real-world attack that allows a malicious user to ride public transports for free. Existing mitigations against FreeRide are either ineffective or impractical since they attempt to enforce the integrity of the smartphone location. Instead of enforcing location integrity, our proposed mitigation, PayRide , establishes the user’s location using the position of the public transport. We have formally verified the PayRide protocol and evaluated its boundary conditions based on a range of possible accuracies reported by the smartphone and public transport.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, executable packing remains an open issue in its detection especially when it comes to static analysis. Packing is significantly used in malware to hide malicious code from detection systems. These last years, many studies about static packing detection addressed this problem with heuristics and machine learning, considering different ad hoc techniques, algorithms and feature sets but very few addressed it from the adversarial point of view, that is, how to fool heuristics by altering samples with targeted modifications. The objective of this work is to study to what extent it is easy to evade detection by open source static detectors that are commonly used by the community by applying alterations on packed samples, which require only slight adaptations of the related packers, resulting in evasion. An adversarial setting from the problem-space perspective is addressed by using realistic modifications of binary samples that target common significant features. For this purpose, alterations and datasets are composed and static detection is applied using the experimental toolkit Packing Box. Results of alterations are shown, in terms of information gain of features and accuracy of detection, on open source static packing detectors. Finally, their significant effects are highlighted and their effectiveness is evaluated.},

  abstract = {Abstract Over the last years, deductive program verifiers have substantially improved, and their applicability on non-trivial applications has been demonstrated. However, a major bottleneck is that for every new programming language, a new deductive verifier has to be built. This paper describes the first steps in a project that aims to address this problem, by language-agnostic support for deductive verification: Rather than building a deductive program verifier for every programming language, we develop deductive program verification technology for a widely-used intermediate representation language (LLVM IR), such that we eventually get verification support for any language that can be compiled into the LLVM IR format. Concretely, this paper describes the design of VCLLVM, a prototype tool that adds LLVM IR as a supported language to the VerCors verifier. We discuss the challenges that have to be addressed to develop verification support for such a low-level language. Moreover, we also sketch how we envisage to build verification support for any specified source program that can be compiled into LLVM IR on top of VCLLVM.},

However, due to the diverse architectures and structures of firmware across different vendors, these methods have limited applicability and cannot perform large-scale testing. To address this issue, we have designed a tool called FIAL, a novel IoT device fuzzing method based on accompanying app interfaces. FIAL allows for the discovery of firmware vulnerabilities without the need for firmware analysis. It leverages a large language model to analyze the accompanying app and extract the most effective function interfaces for fuzzing. We applied FIAL to analyze five popular devices and discovered a total of 14 bugs, including 5 new vulnerabilities. We conducted a comparison with two other network fuzzing tools, and the experiment showed that FIAL can uncover more exploitable vulnerabilities using fewer test cases.},

In addition, this article also uses graph embedding network to extract feature vectors and builds multiple neural network prediction models according to different vulnerability types, and finally achieves function-level vulnerability existence and type prediction for unknown binary files.

The data collected by the honeypot server can be categorized as: connection data, malicious scripts, and malware. By analyzing gathered information and focusing on the reverse engineering of malware, insight will be provided into the functioning of the malicious programs and how to prevent their operation and further spread. Reverse engineering can be divided into two types of analysis – static and dynamic malware analysis. Static analysis is a method in which the malware sample is not executed, while the purpose of dynamic analysis is to monitor the changes caused by the malware after execution.

In this paper, we proposed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network for the Android malware detection method named as Multi-NetDroid. Training and evaluation of the proposed model have been done on publicly available datasets of the android applications.

The Multi-NetDroid model is built with four dense layers for training and classification of malware or benign applications and is evaluated as an improved classifier for Android malware detection. To evaluate our model performance we experimented with two separate datasets (Drebin-215 and Malgenome-15), and our model achieved 99.19\% and 99.12\% of accuracy. Furthermore, for the validation of our framework, we have also compared the results with different Machine Learning (ML) classifiers and found that our model Accuracy outperforms the classical ML methods.},

As a result, we have made three important discoveries regarding these apps: (1) identification of security issues related to the leakage of user privacy data, (2) risk of exposing user device to unauthorized remote control, and (3) usage of highly sensitive non-third-party permissions, and the presence of numerous potential security issues such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) security. Our experiments show that 11 apps had vulnerabilities in login or assistance authentication stage, while 11 apps used insecure communication protocols during the remote assistance stage. Besides, we have submitted 11 more serious vulnerabilities to both the vendor and the security platform.

  abstract = {Android system is facing an increasing threat of malware. Most of the current malware detection systems need to use large-scale training samples to get high accuracy. However, it is difficult to get a lot of samples. To solve this problem, we proposed a MAAMD (Metapath Aggregated Android Malware Detection) to obtain more useful information under the condition of a limited number of samples. In our method, the two most critical information types, namely API and Permission, are extracted as nodes, and the heterogeneous graph is constructed together with the APP nodes. The embedding of APP nodes is completed through two modules: intra-metapath aggregation and inter-metapath aggregation, then the classification of APP nodes is implemented by the SVM classifier. Each selected pathway is aggregated in the intra-metapath aggregation module, which aggregates the features of the intermediate node on the metapath and the features of the destination node itself. Therefore, the aggregated metapath obtains more semantic information which is helpful for malware detection. In the experiment, we achieved 99.68\% accuracy only by 2,505 malicious APPs and 2,431 benign APPs. Compared with other methods that use large-scale training samples, MAAMD achieves higher accuracy by small-scale samples.},

  abstract = {A ndroid phones contain a lot of sensitive and private data, making them a target for hackers or other bad actors, protecting one’s privacy has become crucial to handling security for these devices. These individuals intend to build various forms of malware to take advantage of such users. Repackaging the application or designing programmes that reroute to harmful sources are some typical methods used to produce malware programmes. Therefore, we propose RIPDroid, a framework, which will identify applications based on their permissions and the IP addresses involved. Our proposed model uses permissions requested by the application and the network traffic captured during runtime to develop the overall model for the detection of android malware. The IP reputation model helps in identifying the communications made by application and the permission model aids in checking the maliciousness of the application. Our evaluation includes an overall accuracy of 95.8\% for the permission-based model and an F-1 score of 90.56\% for the IP reputation model.},

  abstract = {Abstract Software performance concerns have been attracting research interest at an increasing rate, especially regarding energy performance in non-wired computing devices. In the context of mobile devices, several research works have been devoted to assessing the performance of software and its underlying code. One important contribution of such research efforts is sets of programming guidelines aiming at identifying efficient and inefficient programming practices, and consequently to steer software developers to write performance-friendly code. Despite recent efforts in this direction, it is still almost unfeasible to obtain universal and up-to-date knowledge regarding software and respective source code performance. Namely regarding energy performance, where there has been growing interest in optimizing software energy consumption due to the power restrictions of such devices. There are still many difficulties reported by the community in measuring performance, namely in large-scale validation and replication. The Android ecosystem is a particular example, where the great fragmentation of the platform, the constant evolution of the hardware, the software platform, the development libraries themselves, and the fact that most of the platform tools are integrated into the IDE’s GUI, makes it extremely difficult to perform performance studies based on large sets of data/applications. In this paper, we analyze the execution of a diversified corpus of applications of significant magnitude. We analyze the source-code performance of 1322 versions of 215 different Android applications, dynamically executed with over than 27900 tested scenarios, using state-of-the-art black-box testing frameworks with different combinations of GUI inputs. Our empirical analysis allowed to observe that semantic program changes such as adding functionality and repairing bugfixes are the changes more associated with relevant impact on energy performance. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that several coding practices previously identified as energy-greedy do not replicate such behavior in our execution context and can have distinct impacts across several performance indicators: runtime, memory and energy consumption. Some of these practices include some performance issues reported by the Android Lint and Android SDK APIs. We also provide evidence that the evaluated performance indicators have little to no correlation with the performance issues’ priority detected by Android Lint. Finally, our results allowed us to demonstrate that there are significant differences in terms of performance between the most used libraries suited for implementing common programming tasks, such as HTTP communication, JSON manipulation, image loading/rendering, among others, providing a set of recommendations to select the most efficient library for each performance indicator. Based on the conclusions drawn and in the extension of the developed work, we also synthesized a set of guidelines that can be used by practitioners to replicate energy studies and build more efficient mobile software.},

  abstract = {Ransomware has affected a broad range of public and private-sector organizations, and the impacts include direct and indirect financial loss (e.g., opportunity costs), reputational damage, legal implications, and physical consequences (e.g., fatalities). However, it has been challenging to accurately detect ransomware. For example, ransomware’s behavioral characteristics differ from many other malicious applications, and it can be laborious to obtain representative features that can be used for machine learning training. In addition, the issue of the imbalanced dataset of minority and majority classes complicates efforts for machine learning models to learn the internal patterns of minority classes. In an effort for tackling such difficulties, we suggest an architecture regarding Android ransomware detection (hereafter referred to as ARdetector), which allows one to analyze the relationship between behav oral characteristics and other candidate features associated with ransomware to select more representative features. In addition, we design a deep neural network based on focal loss, which lowers the loss generated by the majority class. In our evaluations, we use two real-world datasets of different class proportions, and the findings show that the accuracy of the ARdetector on both datasets is over 99.00\% when the imbalanced ratio is 6. Specifically, via the BMR dataset, the AUC as a synthetical categorizing assessment indicator reaches as high as 0.9625 at that ratio of 15.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, the number of computer malware has grown rapidly. Currently, cybercriminals typically use malicious software (malware) as a means of attacking industrial systems. By email, malicious websites, and by downloading and installing software, the internet is the main medium by which malware attacks are conducted on computers. As a result of open standards and the opening of the internet, typical attack techniques can be seen in smart factories. Because of the high level of specialization of industrial cyberattacks, traditional intrusion detection systems that rely on a signature database are also failing. Anomaly detection is therefore becoming increasingly important to the research community. When smart manufacturing or cyber–physical systems involve the use of machine learning techniques to implement this paradigm, great results are obtained. A virus, trojan horse, worm, rootkit, adware, or ransomware are examples of malicious software. Analysis of static, dynamic, hybrid, or deep learning samples reveals whether a sample is malicious or benign. The unique traits of malicious and benign files can then be identified. ML-based malware detection techniques are reviewed in this paper to provide a systematic overview. In this article, 117 carefully selected articles related to malware detection are critically evaluated. It was determined which features are most capable of discriminating malware by examining feature selection methods. The most effective malware detection techniques rely on the extraction of malware features. In this paper an examination of recent trends in machine learning is presented along with an analysis of the challenges and limitations of traditional machine learning. The survey can be used by researchers to delve deeper into malware detection and scientific developments in industries.},

  abstract = {Wireless networking provides many advantages, but it also coupled with new security threats and alters the organization's overall information security risk profile. Meanwhile, researchers are also actively working to enhance the security of embedded devices. However, previous studies have overlooked the insecurity of a particular device category, known as End-of-Life (EoL) devices. When a product reaches its EoL phase, vendors discontinue its maintenance, including the provision of bug fixes and security patches. However, many EoL devices remain on the internet with several critical vulnerabilities, thereby creating a fertile ground for botnets and cyber-attacks. Due to the lack of security updates, hardening the potentially vulnerable firmware in IoT devices is the most direct and promising defense method, but it has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose a systematic active defense approach to harden EoL IoT devices, utilizing a hybrid binary rewriting method to monitor high-risk APIs and filter attack vectors. The proposed system, called Harden-IoT, consists of three tightly coupled modules: suspicious code snippets location, attack vector interception, and heuristic firmware repackaging. It can reinforce different architecture (MIPS, ARM) Linux-Based IoT devices without source code. We evaluate the effectiveness, adaptability, and overhead of the method using 23 firmware images sourced from various vendors. The results show that Harden-IoT can effectively defend against multiple types of vulnerabilities under low overhead conditions while also being able to adapt to different heterogeneous devices.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, blockchain has become increasingly popular due to its promise of supporting critical business services in various areas. Blockchain systems, like Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, rely on sophisticated middleware, which enables the execution of smart contracts. Smart contracts define the business logic within cooperative applications. Detecting attacks and vulnerabilities within blockchain is a crucial issue for ensuring the security of different generations of blockchains. Testing a blockchain application serves multiple purposes: it ensures its quality, maximizes test coverage, and minimizes the risks associated with insufficient knowledge that could potentially impact the software development process. That is why several static analysis tools targeting Ethereum smart contracts and Hyperledger Fabric chaincode have recently been proposed by the blockchain research community. However, the efficiency of these analysis tools remains an open issue that requires further investigation. In this context, this paper presents a new taxonomy related to attacks targeting different generations of blockchain and evaluates the available analysis tools that can be utilized to assess the resilience of blockchain 2.0 and blockchain 3.0 against a range of vulnerabilities and attacks. Additionally, this study presents two quantitative analyses: one assessing the performance of tools in evaluating smart contract vulnerabilities within blockchain 2.0, and another analyzing the performance of tools in assessing blockchain 3.0 vulnerabilities within chaincode. Furthermore, this comprehensive study holds value for the research community as it considers various generations of blockchain.},

The ELM is applied on the host video to select the relevant frames fit for watermarking process. The embedding step is carried out in DWT-SVD domain using Fuzzy-PSO technique. The proposed scheme is tested over five standard videos having advanced video coding (AVC) format. The robustness and visual quality testing post embedding is respectively carried out by computing Normalized Cross-Correlation (NC(W,W’)) and Bit Error Rate (BER(W,W’)) along with Average Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio ( \\(\{PSNR\}\_\{avg\}\\) ) parameters by applying eight different attacks. Our proposed scheme is tested and compared for its outcomes with those of different other standard schemes. It is found that our results are superior to all other frontline schemes.},

  abstract = {Abstract Variable names represent a significant source of information regarding the source code, and a successful naming of variables is key to producing readable code. Programmers often use a compound variable name by concatenating two or more words to make it more informative and enhance the code readability. While each compound variable name is descriptive, a collection of them sometimes produces “confusing” variable pairs if their names are highly similar, e.g., “shippingHeight,” vs. “shippingWeight.” A confusing variable pair would adversely affect the code readability because it can cause a misreading or mix-up of variables during the programming or code review activities. Toward automated support for enhancing code readability, this paper conducts a large-scale investigation of compound variable names in Java and Python programs. The investigation collects 116,921,127 pairs of compound-named variables from 1,876 open-source Java projects and 106,943,523 pairs of such variables from 2,427 open-source Python projects. Then, this study analyzes those variable pairs from two perspectives of name similarity: string similarity and semantic similarity. Through an evaluation study with 30 human participants, the data analyses show that both string and semantic similarity can help detect confusing variable pairs in Java and Python programs. In order to distill confusing variable pairs automatically, support tools for detecting confusing variable pairs are also developed in this study.},

  abstract = {The testing of Android applications(apps) is a challenging task due to the serious fragmentation issues and diverse usage environments. To improve the testing efficiency and collect the feedbacks from real usage scenarios, crowdsourcing has been employed in the testing of Android. However, crowdsourced testing is a manual working paradigm, while the shortage of testing guidance for crowd workers who often have limited software engineering knowledge may result in many redundant or invalid test reports. To fill this gap, this paper presents an automated test case generation approach for the testing of Android apps. Our approach is built upon static program analysis and is capable of providing detailed testing steps to guide workers in performing testing. Furthermore, we use the automated testing tool for pre-testing, and crowd workers only need to test the uncovered test cases. We evaluate our approach with six widely-used apps to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency. The experimental results show that our approach can detect 71.5\% more bugs in diverse categories and achieve 21.8\% higher path coverage in comparison with classic crowdsourced testing techniques. Also, in the experiment, we detect 44 unknown bugs in the six subjects, which indicates our approach is highly promising for assisting the testing of Android apps in practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract Statistics show that more than 80 applications are installed on each android smartphone. Vulnerability research on Android applications is of critical importance. Recently, academic researchers mainly focus on single bug patterns, while few of them investigate the relations between multiple bugs. Industrial researchers proposed a series of logic exploit chains leveraging multiple logic bugs. However, there is no general model to evaluate the chaining abilities between bugs. This paper presents a formal model to elucidate the relations between multiple bugs in Android applications. To prove the effectiveness of the model, we design and implement a prototype system named AppChainer. AppChainer automatically identifies attack surfaces of Android applications and investigates whether the payloads entering these attack surfaces are “chainable”. Experimental results on 2138 popular Android applications show that AppChainer is effective in identifying and chaining attacker-controllable payloads. It identifies 14467 chainable payloads and constructs 5458 chains both inside a single application and among various applications. The time cost and resource consumption of AppChainer are also acceptable. For each application, the average analysis time is 317 s, and the average memory consumed is 2368 MB. Compared with the most relevant work Jandroid, the experiment results on our custom DroidChainBench show that AppChainer outperforms Jandroid at the precision rate and performs equally with Jandroid at the recall rate.},

Most of those obfuscation software applications have been developed to obfuscate the client-side source code. However, one of the most vulnerable parts of web applications is the server side, especially when Java language is used, because that is where the core part of web applications including sensitive data as well as business logic is stored and processed. To safeguard the source code on server-side, the Mutational Obfuscation System (MOS) has been proposed. This system protects web application source code by obfuscating the java class files, packaging and encrypting those class files before it is sent and deployed to the web server. Moreover, to assure that the web application works well after being obfuscated by the MOS system, the availability checking tool has been exploited. Our experiment result shows that the security of the server-side source code has been intensified and the performance of the web application is maintained after the source code is obfuscated.},

  abstract = {Abstract Clone detection has received much attention in many fields such as malicious code detection, vulnerability hunting, and code copyright infringement detection. However, cyber criminals may obfuscate code to impede violation detection. To date, few studies have investigated the robustness of clone detectors, especially in-fashion deep learning-based ones, against obfuscation. Meanwhile, most of these studies only measure the difference between one code snippet and its obfuscation version. However, in reality, the attackers may modify the original code before obfuscating it. Then what we should evaluate is the detection of obfuscated code from cloned code, not the original code. For this, we conduct a comprehensive study evaluating 3 popular deep-learning based clone detectors and 6 commonly used traditional ones. Regarding the data, we collect 6512 clone pairs of five types from the dataset BigCloneBench and obfuscate one program of each pair via 64 strategies of 6 state-of-art commercial obfuscators. We also collect 1424 non-clone pairs to evaluate the false positives. In sum, a benchmark of 524,148 code pairs (either clone or not) are generated, which are passed to clone detectors for evaluation. To automate the evaluation, we develop one uniform evaluation framework, integrating the clone detectors and obfuscators. The results bring us interesting findings on how obfuscation affects the performance of clone detection and what is the difference between traditional and deep learning-based clone detectors. In addition, we conduct manual code reviews to uncover the root cause of the phenomenon and give suggestions to users from different perspectives.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of smartphone technology, the development of mobile applications is rapidly growing. These apps are designed to help mobile users with a variety of everyday tasks, such as e-commerce and online services. Because these applications are widely used, they are susceptible to malicious user attacks. As a result, new challenges have emerged, such as the inability to differentiate between benign and malicious malware applications. This paper proposes two methods for classifying mobile applications into either benign or malicious: 1D convolution (Conv1d) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The suggested approaches use two encoding techniques, namely binary and text encoding, which were applied to the Android permissions of each application. In addition, the support vector machine and K-nearest-neighbor classifiers are reported as well. The two primary approaches were tested on the well-known CICMalDroid2020 dataset. Conv1d and LSTM with text encoding performed the best in terms of precision and accuracy (98.16\%, 97.72\%, and 96.63\%, 96.69\%, respectively). When compared with the Mal-Prem dataset, the Conv1d on binary classification beat the LSTM model.},

  abstract = {Automated software transformations and the process of automated program repair and improvement are an important aspect of modern software engineering practices. In this paper, we describe a system which uses a graph-based deep learning model that can be trained to automatically transform and improve computer programs. By operating on language-agnostic, universal graph-like structures easily extractable from source code files (abstract syntax trees), the deep learning agent learns which transformations should be effectively applied to various structures recognized in the source code in order to improve it. By defining a metric which we want to improve and introducing an optimization task—a reinforcement learning setting, an agent learns to automatically apply a chain of transformations to the program, drastically improving it. While similar program improvement processes exist, they exclusively use exhaustive search algorithms to try all the possible code transformations which is a long process susceptible to local optimum issues. Our solution aims to model and embed structural knowledge about the programs being transformed which greatly helps the agent to choose best possible code transformations to apply. Elements of the approach we present in this paper are further applicable not just to automatic software improvement tasks, but also to other code-related tasks.},

  abstract = {Abstract Smart-locks have become increasingly popular for access to homes and businesses in many countries, because of their ease of use and adaptability. These locks offer a simple and secure alternative to traditional key-based entry, making them an attractive choice for both residential and commercial properties. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the potential security threats that come with any new technology. The security of smart-locks is particularly critical, as a breach could result in unauthorized entry. Since the smart-locks can connect, there are different ways to check if vulnerabilities can be found easily or on the contrary, if the security level is high. Two of the main ways of checking the security level of this kind of IoT device are the information that can be obtained from the Android application and the security level of the Bluetooth connection. Many vulnerabilities can be found in the Android smart lock management application. This application is very useful to perform all the configurations with such a lock, but if it is not properly implemented and secured, it can provide clues for malicious users to perform unauthorized access to the system. Another security factor is the Bluetooth connection. This ensures that only authorized users have access to the property. In this work, we have analyzed the security level of different parts of smart-locks. In particular, we have analyzed the security of the applications for the most important smart-locks on the market. This study reveals relevant information such as whether the application is obfuscated or not, the encryption algorithm for the Bluetooth connection, or relevant URLs that applications use to connect to the cloud. The security of the Bluetooth connection between the smartphone application and two selected smart-locks was also analyzed. It was demonstrated that if no encryption is used for the Bluetooth connection, the smart-lock is not secure, but if AES encryption is used, the security level is high.},

  abstract = {At present, the trend of familiarization of malicious code is becoming more and more obvious, and the research on the homology of malware (the classification of malicious code family) is of great significance for maintaining network security. In order to better express the overall characteristics of malicious code and improve the effect of detection and homology analysis, this paper proposes a method for detection and homology analysis of malware based on heterogeneous graphs of assembly instructions (AIHGAT). We take the assembly instructions of malicious families as the research object and analyze the importance and correlation of assembly instructions of different malicious families. The malware detection and homology analysis are carried out in three aspects: feature extraction, feature preprocessing, and model construction. In the feature extraction of malicious code, in order to alleviate the problem that it is difficult to extract static features of malicious samples that contain countermeasures such as packing and obfuscation, we obtain binary files from dynamic memory through sandbox and then, analyze its assembly instruction set. In feature preprocessing, we divide the assembly instructions into N-tuples and construct a heterogeneous graph based on assembly instructions according to the internal correlation of the gene sequence composed of the assembly N-grams features. Finally, in terms of model construction, we analyze the homology determination effect of the traditional graph neural network and construct the Graph Attention Network based on residual connection named ResGAT to analyze the homology of malicious code. The experimental results show that the ResGAT can gather the core characteristics of malicious families and enhance the ability to recognize malicious family variants. Our model has an accuracy rate of 98.83\%, which is better than traditional machine learning detection methods, and can effectively determine the homology of malicious code families.},

Accordingly, enhancing the security of IoT devices has become the primary objective of industrialists and researchers. However, most present studies lack a deep understanding of IoT malware and its various aspects. As understanding IoT malware is the preliminary base of research, in this work, we present an IoT malware taxonomy with 100 attributes based on the IoT malware categories, attack types, attack surfaces, malware distribution architecture, victim devices, victim device architecture, IoT malware characteristics, access mechanisms, programming languages, and protocols. In addition, we have mapped these categories into 77 IoT Malwares identified between 2008 and 2022. Furthermore, To provide insight into the challenges in IoT malware research for future researchers, our study also reviews the existing IoT malware detection works.},

  abstract = {Today, the number, type and complexity of malware is increasing rapidly. Convolution neural network (CNN) based networks continue to be used in software classification based on image. In this study, a CNN model named Real Time-Droid(RT-Droid), which has a very fast malware detection capability and works based on YOLO V5, is introduced. RT-Droid detects android malware with high accuracy and performs this process at near real-time speed. For this process, firstly the features in the android manifest file are extracted and converted to an image in RGB format similar to QR code. Thus, images become processed by CNN-based deep learning models. These images were used to train VGGNet, Faster R-CNN, YOLO V4 and V5 models with the transfer learning technique. The android malware detection performances of the obtained trained models (weights) were examined. In the tests performed with Drebin, Genome and Arslan dataset, the precision value is 98.3\%, while the F-score value is 97.0\%. In obtaining these values, only 0.019 s per application was needed for analysis. It also requires 25 times less memory space compared to a gray-scale image. Since the small images of the YOLO V5 model can detect objects with very high accuracy and in real time, it provides serious efficiency in processing time. We also compared the results with VGGNet, Faster R-CNN and YOLO V4, which are commonly used CNN models for object detection, and show that it yields results at a higher rate and at least 5.5 times faster than similarly trained networks. Our method detects hacker-generated Android malware very quickly and with high accuracy, while being robust against obfuscated apps.},

They have equipped with the most advanced malware and maintain a hidden attribution. The precocious cyber weapons, targeted and motivated with some specific intention are called as Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). Developing defense mechanisms and performing attribution analysis of such advanced attacks are extremely difficult due to the intricate design of attack vector and sophisticated malware employed with high stealth and evasive techniques. These attacks also include advanced zero-day and negative-day exploits and payloads. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the evolution of advanced malware design paradigms, APT attack vector and its anatomy, APT attack Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP) and specific case studies on open-ended APT attacks. The survey covers a detailed discussion on APT attack phases and comparative study on threat life-cycle specification by various organizations. This work also addresses the APT attack attribution and countermeasures against these attacks from classical signature and heuristic based detection to modern machine learning and genetics based detection mechanisms along with sophisticated zero-day and negative day malware countermeasure by various techniques like monitoring of network traffic and DNS logs, moving target based defense, and attack graph based defenses.

  abstract = {Malware family variants make minor and relevant changes of behaviors based on the original malware. To analyze and detect family variants, security experts must not only understand malware behaviors but also further observe the correlation between the features of these behaviors. However, the recent data-driven based behavior features are too independent and sometimes too general to obtain a comprehensive profile of the changeable malicious behaviors of family variants derived from the original malware. Those features additionally suffer from limited semantic knowledge which narrows the comprehension of family variants. To this end, in this paper, we propose ArgusDroid that takes advantage of the knowledge graph (KG) to construct a permission-API knowledge graph based on the official Android document. Because each permission or API in the document is described by a specific sentence, we can easily acquire and comprehend the relationship between different features via the hyperlink in sentences or sentence similarity. ArgusDroid also extracts various feature sets from the knowledge graph and validates the detection performance on Android malware family variants based on these features. Extensive experiments by using machine learning and neural network classifiers for variant identification have been carried out. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our obtained feature sets based on ArgusDroid, especially when using the classifiers convolutional neural network (CNN) and multi-layer perception (MLP). Furthermore, when compared to similar feature sets that aim to present relationships across different feature types, such as Axplorer, ArgusDroid generates the feature set which significantly improves malware variant detection by 0.3575 average F1.},

If we are using a VPN to protect our online privacy, many of the well-known VPNs are not secure to use.

Some VPNs will steal our bandwidth, infect our computers with malware, install secret tracking libraries on our devices, steal our personal data, and leave our data exposed to third parties. Generally, Android users should be cautious when installing any VPN software on their devices. As a result, it is important to identify malicious VPNs before downloading and installing them on our Android devices. This paper provides an optimised deep learning neural network for identifying fake VPNs, and VPNs infected by malware based on the permissions of the apps, as well as a novel dataset of malicious and benign Android VPNs.

Ethereum smart contracts are deployed on blockchain networks. Ethereum smart contracts are immutable and are vulnerable to simple coding errors called vulnerabilities. The aim of this paper is to classify Ethereum smart contracts vulnerabilities by feature extraction using machine learning. Pixel values collected from images and trigram feature extraction were used to construct the dataset. This dataset was trained using Multilabel k Nearest Neighbours (MLkNN), Binary Relevance kNN (BRkNN), Random Forest (RF), and Naive Bayes (NB), among other machine learning methods. The Naive Bayes Method outperforms the other models in terms of F1-score among all the algorithms tested. The Naive Bayes model achieves F1-scores of 99.38\% and 99.44\% using Binary Relevance and Classifier Chain respectively. In terms of F1-score, the Random Forest model attained a substantial degree of performance, with F1-scores of 96.71\% and 96.61\% using Binary Relevance and Classifier Chain respectively. In comparison, the lazy algorithms MLkNN and BRkNN produced lower F1-scores of 88.19\% and 89.71\%, respectively.

Conversely, the software development industry is motivated by the increasing number and quality of resources that mobile devices possess nowadays (e.g., memory, sensors, processing power or battery). While powerful mobile devices do exist, one of the main driving factors behind the increase of resources is the usage of Cloud technology, which strongly complement mobile computing. As expected, the adoption of measures to mitigate security issues has not accompanied the growth and speed of development for Cloud and Mobile software, to ensure that these are resilient to attacks by design. Aiming to contribute to decrease the gap between software and security engineering, this paper presents a deep approach to attack taxonomy, security mechanisms, and security test specification for the Cloud and Mobile ecosystem of applications.

  abstract = {The protection and privacy of the 5G-IoT framework is a major challenge due to the vast number of mobile devices. Specialized applications running these 5G-IoT systems may be vulnerable to clone attacks. Cloning applications can be achieved by stealing or distributing commercial Android apps to harm the advanced services of the 5G-IoT framework. Meanwhile, most Android app stores run and manage Android apps that developers have submitted separately without any central verification systems. Android scammers sell pirated versions of commercial software to other app stores under different names. Android applications are typically stored on cloud servers, while API access services may be used to detect and prevent cloned applications from being released. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid approach to the Control Flow Graph (CFG) and a deep learning model to secure the smart services of the 5G-IoT framework. First, the newly submitted APK file is extracted and the JDEX decompiler is used to retrieve Java source files from possibly original and cloned applications. Second, the source files are broken down into various android-based components. After generating Control-Flow Graphs (CFGs), the weighted features are stripped from each component. Finally, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is designed to predict potential cloned applications by training features from different components of android applications. Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach can achieve an average accuracy of 96.24\% for cloned applications selected from different android application stores.},

We extracted all APIs called in the experimental samples through decompilation, and then calculated and ranked the threats related to these APIs according to the mutual information model, selected the top 20 sensitive API calls, and generated a 20-dimensional feature vector for each application. In the classification process, an integrated learning model based on DT classifier, kNN classifier and SVM classifier is used to effectively detect unknown APK samples. We collected 516 benign samples and 528 malicious samples. Through a large number of experiments, the results show that the accuracy of our scheme can be up to 94\%, and the precision is up to 95\%.},

Being an open-source platform has also become a prime target for the attackers as growing users. This paper focuses on the work done on the Android platform by performing static analysis on the permission-based framework and permission extraction tool—AndRev, which is designed. Extracted many permission-based features by reverse engineering of the Android application (apk) files using the batch-scripted tool. AndRev tool is used to decompile apks in batch mode. Features have been stored in feature vectors. Firstly, analysis is done using feature vectors to study the pattern of permissions in applications as per the category. Two categories of apks, namely general and entertainment apps, are studied with an initial dataset of 50 applications each. Secondly, do an experimental study of applications permission removal by using a reverse engineering method. Updated apks are recompiled apps, which execute on a mobile phone as the way it executes like the original app. The study consists of ten apps from Google Play with various categories. The study concludes that it is not easy to remove permission as per the type of permission and the relation of apps permission with app’s relevant functionality. Finally, performed security analysis on the vulnerabilities within the source code, and those are used for accessing resources or unauthorized permission authorization of Android apk. For the study, many vulnerabilities based features were extracted by vulnerability assessment tool Quixxi for the Android application (apk) files. The study depicts that medium-risk vulnerabilities are higher than high- and low-risk vulnerabilities. In security analysis point of view, observations concluded would be useful to future Android app developers},

  abstract = {With the boom of malware, the area of malware detection and the use of gadget assist to gain knowledge in research drastically with the aid of researchers. The conventional methods of malware detection are incompetent to detect new and generic malware. In this article, a generic malware detection process is proposed using machine learning named AndroHealthCheck. The malware detection process is divided into four phases, namely android file collection, decompilation, feature mining and machine learning. The overall contributions made in AndroHealthCheck are as follows: (1) designing and implementing a crawler for automating the process of benign files download, (2) collection of unstructured data from the downloaded APK files through the decompilation process, (3) defining a proper mechanism for the feature selection process by performing a static analysis process, (4) designing and implementing a feature mining script for extracting the features from unstructured data collection from APK files, (5) generating a rich homemade data set for machine learning with a huge variety and different flavours of malware files from different families and (6) evaluating the performance of the generated data set by using different types of supervised machine learning classifiers. In this article, the overall architecture and deployment flow of AndroHealthCheck are also discussed.},

The top half is an abstract network which is trained by supervised learning and can be used to classify and regress. The bottom half is a concrete network which is accomplished by inverse function and trained by self-supervised learning. It can generate the input of abstract network from concept or label. The network can achieve its intended functionality through testing by mnist dataset and convolution neural network. Round function is added between the abstract network and concrete network in order to get the representative generation of class. The generation ability can be increased by adding jump connection and negative feedback. At last, the characteristics of the network is discussed. The input can be changed to any form by encoder and then change it back by decoder through inverse function. The concrete network can be seen as the memory stored by the parameters. Lethe is that when new knowledge input, the training process makes the parameters change. At last, the application of the network is discussed. The network can be used for logic generation through deep reinforcement learning. The network can also be used for language translation, zip and unzip, encryption and decryption, compile and decompile, modulation and demodulation.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts are a leading light moment in blockchain technology 2.0 and are universally used in various applications. A smart contract is a digital agreement for financial transactions. A logical or syntactical error in the smart contract will breach the system’s security. However, smart contracts are not always secure, and numerous flaws exist and cannot be modified due to the immutability feature of smart contracts. The most critical problems for smart contracts are vulnerabilities, resulting in massive financial losses. As a result, extensive research should be conducted before installing a smart contract. Despite the fact that numerous methods for detecting vulnerabilities have been proposed in previous research, all of them have a high false positive and false negatives. To address these issues, Ethersolve, a method based on symbolic execution at the EVM bytecode level, was used to analyze the strategies. A static analysis method based on the symbolic implementation of the Ethereum operand stack to settle Ethereum bytecode jumps and establish an accurate control-flow graph (CFG) of the accumulated smart contracts. Here we analyze the CFG of smart contracts using Ethersolve tool. And then weigh the benefits and drawbacks of Ethersolve and present our findings.},

But data security is one of the main issues which is still a hurdle for all because as the technology is growing malware authors are also developing new malwares to attack these mobile devices to show their existence and sometimes for monetary benefits. Android is most used mobile operating system, and this is the reason it is targeted by malware authors or attackers. Malware detection systems are also developed but still there is need to work on this issue. In this paper, we have proposed a technique that will detect the malwares in Android operating system. It is a hybrid technique based on three-layered crossed analysis. In this, we will apply static analysis on first two layers and dynamic on third layer. Visualization and string search analysis will work on static phase, and system call log analysis will check the behaviour of running application. So, it will cover all the packed application along with code obfuscation, metamorphic malware and zero-day attacks.},

  abstract = {In the present day, smartphones are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, with people of all ages relying on them for daily use. The number of app downloads continues to skyrocket, with 1.6 million apps downloaded every hour in 2022, amounting to a staggering total of 142.6 billion downloads. Google Play outpaces iOS with 110.1 billion downloads compared to iOS’s 32.6 billion. Given the growing threat of malware applications for Android users, it is essential to quickly and effectively identify such apps. App permissions represent a promising approach to malware detection, particularly for Android users. Researchers are actively exploring various techniques for analyzing app permissions to enhance the accuracy of malware detection. Overall, understanding the importance of app permissions in identifying potentially harmful apps is a critical step in protecting smartphone users from malware threats. In our paper, we implemented enhanced correlation-based feature selection (ECFS) technique to predict whether an app is malicious or non-malicious which uses both feature-feature and feature-class correlation scores, i.e., ENMRS and crRelevance for computation. We then predicted the accuracy with various machine learning techniques on the basis of ECFS scores and found the highest accuracy as 92.25 \% for \\(n\_\{1\}\\) and \\(n\_\{2\}\\) values as 0.9 and 0.1, respectively. This accuracy is achieved by random forest ML technique.},

The Android system has come up as one of the most popular platforms for the apps to enable the IoT systems. The Android apps are known to seek permissions to access various user data for their smooth functioning. Many of the apps end up procuring permissions to more user data than are required by it actually. These extra permissions are often used by malicious apps to access information which would otherwise be private to the user. The users are mostly unaware of the risks involved while allowing the apps at install time in their eagerness to use the apps.

  abstract = {Hidden cameras, also called spy cameras, are surveillance tools commonly used to spy on people without their knowledge. Whilst previous studies largely focused on investigating the detection of such a camera and the privacy implications, the security of the camera itself has received limited attention. Compared with ordinary IP cameras, spy cameras are normally sold in bulk at cheap prices and are ubiquitously deployed in hidden places within homes and workplaces. A security compromise of these cameras can have severe consequences. In this paper, we analyse a generic IP camera module, which has been packaged and re-branded for sale by several spy camera vendors. The module is controlled by mobile phone apps available on iOS and Android. By analysing the Android app and the traffic data, we reverse-engineered the security design of the whole system, including the module’s Linux OS environment, the file structure, the authentication mechanism, the session management, and the communication with a remote server. Serious vulnerabilities have been identified in every component. Combined together, these vulnerabilities allow an adversary to take complete control of a spy camera from anywhere over the Internet, enabling arbitrary code execution. This is possible even if the camera is behind a firewall. All that an adversary needs to launch an attack is the camera’s serial number, which users sometimes unknowingly share in online reviews. We responsibly disclosed our findings to the manufacturer. Whilst the manufacturer acknowledged our work, they showed no intention to fix the problems. Patching or recalling the affected cameras is infeasible due to complexities in the supply chain. However, it is prudent to assume that bad actors have already been exploiting these flaws. We provide details of the identified vulnerabilities in order to raise public awareness, especially on the grave danger of disclosing a spy camera’s serial number.},

XAI methods are capable of providing Android malware analysts with some explanations of why a certain sample has been classified as malicious or benign. However, human analysts also have domain-specific requirements, i.e., expectations of how XAI methods should behave. For example, analysts expect that similar malware samples will be explained in a similar way. Recent works by Warnecke et al. [ 41 ] and Fan et al. [ 13 ] have proposed domain-specific properties for local XAI methods that provide explanations for a single sample. In this work, we formulate three domain-specific properties for global XAI rule-based malware detection methods: stability , robustness and effectiveness . We evaluate performance of five explanation approaches (SIRUS, deepRED, REM-D, ECLAIRE and inTrees) using these metrics. Our experimental results show that the SIRUS method outperforms the other five state-of-the-art methods, with stability, robustness, and effectiveness values of 96.15 \\(\\\%\\) , 95.56 \\(\\\%\\) , and 91.65 \\(\\\%\\) respectively.

Modern smart contracts use software tricks to enable upgradeability, raising the research questions of how upgradeability is achieved and who is authorized to make changes. In this paper, we summarize and evaluate six upgradeability patterns. We develop a measurement framework for finding how many upgradeable contracts are on Ethereum that use certain prominent upgrade patters. We find 1.4 million proxy contracts which 8,225 of them are unique upgradeable proxy contracts. We also measure how they implement access control over their upgradeability: about 50\% are controlled by a single Externally Owned Address (EOA), and about 14\% are controlled by multi-signature wallets in which a limited number of persons can change the whole logic of the contract.},

For example, buffer overflow is a quite common vulnerability that occurs when a program receives too much data that can corrupt nearby space in memory and manipulate other data for malicious actions. To detect potential vulnerabilities in source code, we consider the code as multisource data by extracting semantically meaningful sub-graphs: Abstract Syntax Tree Graph (ASTG) and Tokenized Data Flow Graph (TDFG). We combine these with the original sequence of tokens and 49 heuristic features to train and leverage a multimodal deep learning network to detect vulnerable statements. We propose a Multisource Deep Learner (MDL) with joint representations based on the pretrained attention-based Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU) neural networks for vulnerability detection in source code. Our framework not only detects potential vulnerabilities but also locates and ranks the vulnerable statements according to their importance based on the Program Dependence Graph (PDG). Our results show that an MDL-based model using multiple modalities is significantly better than a single modality based model. We also present comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Today, Android has become the most popular operating system because of its salient features. As it is an open-source mobile OS, several developers are developing and publishing their android applications. On the other side, attackers are manipulating those applications in the form of malicious software (Malware) by leveraging the application or functional flow of android OS and those malwares create loss or leakage of confidential sensitive information. Though most anti-virus software affords defence against malware attacks, still the attacks are highly possible in the real time adversarial environment. In this paper, the machine learning-based detection method is designed by combining the features of application namely permission and activity which are obtained during the installation of apps. In our design, permissions and activities of each app are extracted making use of Androguard tool. Using this feature combination, malicious apps are classified as either benign or malicious. The advantage of this method is that there is no need for any dynamic analysis. In our experimentation, we used real-world app samples with 500 malware and 500 benign to train the algorithm for better performance. Based on the experimentation results, highest detection rate is attained by Random Forest (RF) with 95\% of accuracy and lowest detection rate is obtained by K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with 79\% of accuracy.},

  abstract = {In the era of Industry 5.0, there has been tremendous usage of android platforms in several handheld and mobile devices. The openness of the android platform makes it vulnerable for critical malware attacks. Meanwhile, there is also dramatic advancement in malware obfuscation and evading strategies. This leads to failure of traditional malware detection methods. Recently, machine learning techniques have shown promising outcome for malware detection. But past works utilizing machine learning algorithms suffer from several challenges such as inadequate feature extraction, dependency on hand-crafted features, and many more. Thus, existing machine learning approaches are inefficient in detecting sophisticated malware, thus require further enhancement. In this paper, we extract behavioural characteristics of system calls and dynamic API features using our proposed multimodal deep learning model ( MDLDroid ). Our model extracts system call features using LSTM layers and extracts dynamic API features using CNN. Further, both the features are fused in a vector space which is finally classified for benign and malign categories. Comparison with several state-of-the-art approaches on two dataset shows a significant improvement of 4–12\% by the metric accuracy.},

  abstract = {API-call sequence, a significant dynamic feature of the software, is widely applied to malware detection. Unfortunately, native approaches to API-call analysis are time-consuming and cause heavy performance penalties. To improve the efficiency of API-call analysis, this paper proposes a novel dynamic analysis approach named SeqTrace based on Intel Process Trace (PT) and Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) technologies. First, we propose an API-call Tracing approach based on the Intel PT feature of the CPU. It leverages Intel PT to trace the execution of analyzed samples and logs relative information of their API calls with slight overhead. Then, to efficiently translate the semantics of API calls from logged information, we design Semantic Decoder based on VMI technology. Moreover, we implement a prototype API called SeqTrace on the QEMU/KVM platform and evaluate it through a set of experiments. Compared with previous approaches, the experimental results show that SeqTrace achieves API-call sequence tracing with fine-grained semantic information and reduces the tracing overhead by more than 80\%.},

With the provision of services such as easy access to transaction history, and checking account balance besides transmissions of new transactions in distributed networks such as Blockchains, cryptocurrency wallet apps gain unprecedented popularity which in turn attracts malicious actors to attack users resulting in loss of cryptocurrency assets and leakage of sensitive user data. This paper presents the first large-scale study of Android cryptocurrency wallet apps. We surveyed apps on Google Play to detect and extract meta-data and application packages of 457 cryptocurrency wallet apps. We perform several passive and active measurements designed to investigate the security and privacy features to study the behavior of cryptocurrency wallet apps. Our analysis includes investigating cryptocurrency wallet apps’ third-party embedding, malware presences, and exfiltration of users’ sensitive data to third-parties. Our study reveals vulnerabilities and privacy issues in cryptocurrency apps including the insecure use of HTTP to serve transactions.},

  abstract = {The maintenance phase is an activity carried out by software engineers that requires an understanding how computer programs work. However, most legacy systems lack associated documentation and have poorly designed artifacts. As a result, technical debt is generated, which causes a significant increase in maintenance costs. Reverse engineering is applied to help software engineers to understand how the program was designed. Within reverse engineering, different approaches reduce the effort required for comprehension. In addition, static, dynamic, and hybrid analysis techniques are used to generate artifacts where the program’s behavior can be easily visualized. This paper presents the results of a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) conducted to identify reverse engineering approaches to help software engineers understand computer programs. Forty-eight studies were selected. Ten different approaches were identified in these studies, the main ones being Model-Driven Reverse Engineering (MDRE) and visualization graphics; static, dynamic, and hybrid analysis techniques were found; and fifteen artifacts featuring visualization graphs, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams.},

The objective of path planning is that all AGVs reach their destination in the shortest possible time without collisions. The proposed path planning algorithm is an extension of the A* algorithm and takes into account the priorities of the AGVs. An occupancy time window approach is used to detect and resolve predicted collisions. The algorithm determines waiting times and waiting locations that allow collision-free driving. The node occupancy algorithm also considers the shape of the vehicle and its speed. The result of the path search algorithm is the path for each vehicle and the waiting times on each road. The resulting paths are converted into corresponding action plans that are sent to all AGVs for execution. The applicability of the proposed path planning algorithm was evaluated in a simulation environment and on real small-scale AGVs.},

  abstract = {Android malware poses a serious threat to cyberspace security, and many researchers are committed to researching fast and effective methods for Android malware detection. However, the latest Android malware usually uses escape techniques such as code obfuscation, so the traditional machine learning methods gradually become invalid.

This paper conducts a review and research on the related achievements of Android malware detection based on deep learning in recent years, and classifies Android malware detection methods according to different characteristics and different networks. At the same time, a systematic introduction on deep learning model algorithms, such as RNN, CNN, Attention Mechanism, etc., is made. Besides, we analyze most commonly used datasets and evaluation indicators.

In this regard, the contribution of this short paper is twofold: we propose a method to (i) detect the malware belonging family and (i) provide reasoning about model evaluation and assess model soundness. The rationale behind this work aims to improve the evaluation of image-based deep learning models for malware family detection, especially in supervised learning tasks without recognizable or known patterns in the dataset samples.

  abstract = {Abstract Efficiency is a fundamental property of any type of program, but it is even more so in the context of the programs executing on the blockchain (known as smart contracts ). This is because optimizing smart contracts has direct consequences on reducing the costs of deploying and executing the contracts, as there are fees to pay related to their bytes-size and to their resource consumption (called gas ). Optimizing memory usage is considered a challenging problem that, among other things, requires a precise inference of the memory locations being accessed. This is also the case for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode generated by the most-widely used compiler, , whose rather unconventional and low-level memory usage challenges automated reasoning. This paper presents a static analysis, developed at the level of the EVM bytecode generated by , that infers write memory accesses that are needless and thus can be safely removed. The application of our implementation on more than 19,000 real smart contracts has detected about 6,200 needless write accesses in less than 4 hours. Interestingly, many of these writes were involved in memory usage patterns generated by that can be greatly optimized by removing entire blocks of bytecodes. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimization tools cannot infer such needless write accesses, and hence cannot detect these inefficiencies that affect both the deployment and the execution costs of Ethereum smart contracts.},

  abstract = {The growing connectivity of Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) in the era of Industry 4.0 has triggered a dramatic increase in the number of cyber-physical attacks , i.e., security breaches in cyberspace that adversely alter the physical processes (see, e.g., the Stuxnet worm). The main challenge attackers face in the development of cyber-physical attacks is obtaining an adequate level of process comprehension. Process comprehension is defined as “the understanding of system characteristics and components responsible for the safe delivery of service” (Green et al. 2017). While there exist a number of tools (Nmap, PLCScan, Xprobe, etc.) one can use to develop a level of process comprehension through the targeting of controllers alone, they are limited by functionality, scope, and detectability. Thus, to support the execution of realistic cyber-physical attack scenario with adequate level of physical process comprehension, we propose a black-box dynamic analysis reverse engineering tool to derive from scans of memory registers of exposed controllers an approximated model of the controlled physical process. Such an approximated model is developed by inferring statistical properties, business processes and, in particular, system invariants whose knowledge might be crucial to build up stealthy (i.e., undetectable) attacks. We test the proposed methodology on a non-trivial case study, taken from the context of industrial water treatment systems.},

  abstract = {With the broad usage of Android smartphones, malware growth has been rising exponentially. The high prominence of Android applications has roused attackers to target them. In the past few years, most scientists and researchers have researched detecting Android malware through machine learning and deep learning techniques. Though these traditional techniques provide good detection accuracy, they need high configuration machines such as GPUs to train complex datasets. To resolve this problem, the transfer learning approach is presented in this paper to efficiently detect Android malware with low computational power requirements. By transferring the necessary features and information from a pre-trained source model to a target model, transfer learning lowers the computational cost. In this paper, we initially performed Android malware detection using traditional models such as convolutional neural networks and then we applied the transfer learning technique to reduce the computational cost. Additionally, we evaluated how well the suggested strategy performed against other cutting-edge malware detection methods. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 97.5 with 2.2\% false positive rate. In addition, the overfitting problem and high computational power requirements are also reduced.},

Existing detection methods mainly focus on known vulnerabilities with clear features and cannot deal with unknown vulnerabilities. As a consequence, proposing a method for detecting unknown vulnerabilities in smart contracts represents a significant advancement in the field of smart contract security. Aiming at this problem, based on the idea that the opcode sequences of transactions containing unknown vulnerabilities have similarities to the opcode sequences of transactions containing known vulnerabilities, we propose a novel approach for unknown vulnerability detection in smart contracts using a CNN-BiLSTM model. Our model determines whether a vulnerability is unknown by detecting the opcode sequence representing the entire execution process of a transaction. Experimental results with the opcode sequences of transactions show that the model can achieve 82.86\% accuracy and 83.63\% F1-score.},

  abstract = {With the wider implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in multi-agent systems, the security effect of IoT vulnerabilities on the systems is getting more and more serious. It is critical to investigate the vulnerability of IoT devices to guarantee a secure system operation. Among the vulnerabilities studied in the literature, cryptographic misuse can compromise the confidentiality of sensitive data, which may further lead to severe buffer over-read. However, current works mainly focus on cryptographic misuse in Android and iOS settings while the study in IoT applications has not attracted enough attention. The latter should be adaptive to various file systems, making it more challenging for vulnerability analysis. In this paper, we propose a cryptographic function analysis framework to identify and analyze suspect cryptographic functions in different IoT devices. The framework contains three blocks: Binary file extraction, cryptographic function identification, and application scenarios analysis, where a function feature matching method and an improved instruction statistics method are designed to identify standard and non-standard cryptographic functions. In particular, we devise a cross-reference relationship graph to describe the call relationship of suspect functions. By the proposed framework, we analyze 430 commonly used IoT firmwares from 12 vendors with high market share, and identify 18,139 cryptographic related functions and 1,219 other functions.},

  abstract = {The Android operating system is considered to be the most advanced and popular smart phone operating system and has a dramatic increase in the market with approximately 1.5 billion Android-based devices shipped by 2021. This spike increased in the market leads to high number of malwares in the Android platform. The reason is simple, because the mutating nature of Android malwares reduces the efficiency of malware detection tools in that are already in the market. Furthermore, the vast number of features in the Android platform provides a big challenge to the current tools to detect the Android malware on IOT-based platform. In this paper, we used a real physical device, i.e., Android smart phone, smart tablets, Android watches instead of protected environment like genymotion for analysis and extract the feature from 10,650 applications of malware and benign. Large spaces of feature set are reduced with the use of principal component analysis approach which extracts the best features from the dataset. The data is then fed to the deep learning model with different hidden layers; the algorithms are applied for dynamic features as well as the combination with permissions. The results reveals that the deep learning model with three hidden layers gives overall best accuracy as compared to the previous works done on the same field using protected environment.},

It is dangerous if a smart device using artificial intelligence misrecognizes the object class. Attackers today often use adversarial examples, which at first glance do not differ from an image that is defined as natural when collected from sensors, or digital devices. Many studies on attacks and methods of combating these attacks have been tested by research groups and announced to be highly effective against attack or pattern recognition. Training the model with the aim of making the model able to recognize the adversarial example, a seemingly simple but effective method to make the model more robust, and capable of classification and identification. In this paper, to enhance the robustness of the model, the authors use adversarial training and experiment on the YOLOv7 model. Experiments show that this method is effective, making the model more powerful, capable of detecting and classifying adversarial examples after the model has been adversarial trained.},

We identify the main shortcoming of state-of-the-art approaches and add a capability to classify packed binaries’ architecture employing an entropy-based method. Then, we implement an LSTM-based model with heuristics to recognize the section boundaries inside a binary, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

  abstract = {Data acquisition for ML-driven malware detection is challenging. While large commercial datasets exist, they are prohibitively expensive. On the other hand, an entity (e.g., a bank or government), may be targeted with unique malware, but the data samples available will never be sufficient to train a bespoke ML-based detector. While data augmentation has been a key component in improving deep learning models by providing requisite diversity for generalization, it has proven far more challenging for malware detection. The main challenges are that (1) determining the augmentations to make is not straightforward, (2) operations are on binaries rather than source code (which is not available), complicating correctness and understanding, and (3) labeling new files mandates expensive binary reverse engineering. We present Marvolo for creating realistic, semantics preserving transformations that mimic the code alterations made by malware authors in practice, allowing us to generate augmented data on raw binary files. This also enables Marvolo to safely propagate labels to newly-generated data. Across several malware datasets and recent ML-based detectors, Marvolo improves accuracy and AUC by up to 5\% and 10\% respectively, while boosting efficiency by 79x by avoiding redundant computation.},

  abstract = {With the widespread applications of smart contract, a large number of smart contracts with virtual coins have been deployed on Ethereum. However, smart contracts may have vulnerabilities that cause huge losses. Therefore, it is a critical issue to effectively and time-savingly detect potential vulnerabilities in contracts. Oyente and Mythril are both contract analysis tools based on symbolic execution, which rely on control flow graph to detect vulnerabilities and are time-consuming. In this work, we propose CDRF to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts with machine learning. First, we summarize four kinds of opcode fragments containing key vulnerability instructions. The opcode fragments are processed by word2vec and PCA to obtain one-dimensional binary features. Second, we use five machine learning algorithms to build the model. This method uses the 53651 real-world smart contracts on Ethereum for evaluation. When we use CDRF as the training model, the highest predictive value of F1-socre is 98.03 \\(\\\%\\) , and the rest are above 93 \\(\\\%\\) ; the highest predictive value of AUC is 99.56 \\(\\\%\\) , and the rest are above 94 \\(\\\%\\) . Meanwhile, the average detection time for each smart contract is 3 s. The experimental results show that the method is effective and time-saving.},

  abstract = {Protecting software from illegal reverse engineering and malicious hackers is often remedied through either legal or technical means. In the technical domain, software obfuscation provides less than perfect protection against such attacks since there is no perfect obfuscator for all classes of programs. However, semantic preserving transformations can attempt to make the cost of attacks prohibitive in either time or resources. Software-based hardware abstraction (SBHA) is a novel approach that transforms traditional software code segments into a digital logic form and thus virtualizes code into a hardware abstraction. SBHA can be used to protect embedded secrets in programs that are used to guard intellectual property (IP). Secrets such as passwords, PINs, and activation codes authorize legitimate end-users to install or activate software for use and are validated typically through point functions that check for the single unique input that is expected. In this study we extend initial analysis of SBHA against state-of-the-art dynamic symbolic execution (DSE) attacks in recovering embedded program secrets and consider the limits of an attacker that recovers the logic circuit netlist from an SBHA-protected program. We pose four approaches for hardened SBHA configurations and evaluate their effectiveness using typical analysis tools that cover synthesis, binary decision diagram recovery, and symbolic analysis. We show that such attacks can be mitigated by these countermeasures outright and discuss the trade-off in size and overhead relative to the relatively low-cost of SBHA point-functions stand alone. We conclude that for single use operations such as point function checks, the overhead is large but the execution runtime delta is negligible.},

In order to facilitate the use of these codes by customers, Google has proposed APIs that allow the automatic verification of the SMS messages without the intervention of the users themselves. One of these APIs is the SMS Retriever API for Android devices. This article presents a study of this API. Different scenarios of interaction between mobile apps and SMS OTP servers are posed to determine which implementations of the SMS Retriever API are vulnerable. The study presented here focuses on Spain’s banking sector. The results show that there are vulnerable implementations which would allow cybercriminals to steal the users’ SMS OTP codes. The desirable equilibrium between ease of use and security needs to be improved in order to maintain the high level of security which has traditionally characterized this sector. The proposed methodology, applied here to this particular sector (banking), is nevertheless simple enough to be applied to any other sector. One of its advantages is that it proposes a method for detecting bad implementations of the SMS Retriever API on the server side, based on analyses of the apps, which would make it easily applicable.},

Precisely detecting and analyzing TPLs is challenging because their code usually is not publicly available or obfuscated. Prior studies do not perform well in detecting closed-source or obfuscated TPLs and analyzing their privacy risks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect TPLs in Android Apps and analyze privacy leakage caused by TPLs. The key idea of our approach is that it leverages the call frequencies of different types of APIs as features and conducts a clustering algorithm on these features, our approach works well on obfuscated TPLs, especially those with dead code removal and control flow randomization. We also analyze whether there is privacy leakage in a TPL by dynamically instrumenting privacy-related APIs and inspecting its call stack. We implement our approach in a tool named Libmonitor and evaluate it on 162 obfuscated Apps and 217 real-world Apps. Experimental results show that Libmonitor outperforms two state-of-the-art tools on two datasets. With obfuscated TPLs, Libmonitor improves 394.08\% over Libradar and 26.32\% over LibD on F1 metric, respectively. With closed-source TPLs, Libmonitor increases 18.66\% over Libradar and 150.15\% over LibD on F1 metric, respectively. Besides, Libmonitor found 5809 pieces of privacy leakage risks caused by 152 TPLs in 64 real-world Apps.},

  abstract = {The development of real-time embedded systems is usually preceded by an important design phase to ensure that functional and behavioural constraints are met. However, the modification of some systems, especially Unmanned Air Vehicles that need to be frequently customised, is typically done in an ad-hoc way. Indeed, the design information may not be available, which may affect the proper functioning of the system. This paper aims to propose a framework helping reverse-engineering a Modifiable Off-The-Shelf (MOTS) embedded system in order to be able to ease its modification. In other words, our objective is to point out where modifications have to happen, and allow smooth use of third-party analysis and/or architecture exploration tools to re-analyse non-functional properties (safety, performances, etc.) regarding the customisation. This framework extracts functional-chains from the source code and represents them visually as a model-based design by using model-driven engineering settings.},

  abstract = {The identification of vulnerabilities is an important element in the software development life cycle to ensure the security of software. While vulnerability identification based on the source code is a well studied field, the identification of vulnerabilities on basis of a binary executable without the corresponding source code is more challenging. Recent research [ 1 ] has shown how such detection can generally be enabled by deep learning methods, but appears to be very limited regarding the overall amount of detected vulnerabilities. We analyse to what extent we could cover the identification of a larger variety of vulnerabilities. Therefore, a supervised deep learning approach using recurrent neural networks for the application of vulnerability detection based on binary executables is used. The underlying basis is a dataset with 50,651 samples of vulnerable code in the form of a standardised LLVM Intermediate Representation. Te vectorised features of a Word2Vec model are used to train different variations of three basic architectures of recurrent neural networks (GRU, LSTM, SRNN). A binary classification was established for detecting the presence of an arbitrary vulnerability, and a multi-class model was trained for the identification of the exact vulnerability, which achieved an out-of-sample accuracy of 88\% and 77\%, respectively. Differences in the detection of different vulnerabilities were also observed, with non-vulnerable samples being detected with a particularly high precision of over 98\%. Thus, our proposed technical approach and methodology enables an accurate detection of 23 (compared to 4 [ 1 ]) vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {Membership inference attacks are used as an audit tool to quantify training data leaks in machine learning models. Protection can be provided by anonymizing the training data or using training functions with differential privacy. Depending on the context, such as building data collection services for central machine learning models or responding to queries from end users, data scientists can choose between local and global differential privacy parameters. Different types of differential privacy have different epsilon values that reflect different mechanisms, making it difficult for data scientists to select appropriate differential privacy parameters and avoid inaccurate conclusions. The experiments in this paper show the relative privacy-accuracy trade-off of local and global differential privacy mechanisms under a white-box membership inference attack. While membership inference only reflects the lower bound for inference risk, and differential privacy formulates the upper bound, the experiments in this study with some datasets show that the trade-off between accuracy and privacy is similar for both types of mechanisms, although there is a large difference in their upper bounds. This suggests that the upper bound is far from the practical susceptibility to membership inference. Therefore, a small epsilon value in global differential privacy and a large epsilon value in local differential privacy lead to the same risk of membership inference. In addition, the risks from membership inference attacks are not uniform across all classes, especially when the training dataset in machine learning models is skewed.},

This paper analyzes the use of cryptographic APIs in Android malware by comparing them to benign Android applications. In particular, Android applications released between 2012 and 2020 have been analyzed, and more than 1 million cryptographic API expressions have been gathered. We created a processing pipeline to produce a report to reveal trends and insights on how and why cryptography is employed in Android malware. Results showed that the usage of cryptographic APIs in malware differs from that made in benign applications. The different patterns in the use of cryptographic APIs in malware and benign applications have been further analyzed through the explanations of Android malware detectors based on machine learning approaches, showing how crypto-related features can improve detection performances. We observed that the transition to more robust cryptographic techniques is slower in Android malware than in benign applications.},

  abstract = {Today all humankind is willing to avail more facilities and hopes everything should be available with a click of the button. In order to offer different services, the developers have come with inbuilt modules of several systems. This make easy system develoment and services may be offered intantly. These services are connected to the internet and accessible via Android phones and IoT devices. But this inbuilt module suffers from a lot of vulnerabilities, bugs, and default settings which may be difficult to change, as happened at the time of changing the password of home-based Wi-Fi router, which require external applications and OTP verifications, etc. Due to these issues and new hacking tools and techniques, security is a major challenge today. The basic framework to provide adequate security of the system comprises five following principles: integrity, confidentiality, availability, privacy, and nonrepudiation. The attacker may leverage advantage of any shortcomings that may lead to several issues. This work explores the cause of threads/vulnerability particularly for IoT, IIoT, SCADA, and Android application systems. The structure of this work is divided in different sections like, a short introduction to Malware, how it infects the system, and a detailed malware exploitation plan that is generally followed by expert attackers to exploit the vulnerabilities related to critical infrastructure or to defame the organization or countries is presented. In addition, General framework based introduction on IoT and Android is also presented with common vulnerabilities at every stage and respective mitigation strategies. Both static and dynamic analyses are evaluated in this work. It is identified that, for a better model design and evaluation, both are highly recommended for the implementation of effective malware detection strategies. Along with these models in order to protect the infra-structure Honeynet, IDS, IPS, Hardware-based securities like CPU and Memory and forensic analysis are also very effective.},

  abstract = {A survey of literature shows that transforming the application files into images and employing deep learning-based models for image classification has been considered as one of the significant directions for malware detection and classification. Mainly, convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models are successfully employed for Android malware detection and classification. This is mainly due to the reason that this type of malware detection and classification approach is platform independent and has the capability to detect metamorphic and polymorphic malware. The Image-based Android malware detection is resilient to both unpacked and packed malware. Following, this work employs various 26 CNN-based pretrained models and the detailed investigation and analysis of experiments are shown on the Image-based Android malware dataset. Each of these models have the capability to extract its own optimal features and these features are distinct to each other. The penultimate layer features of best performed CNN-based pretrained models are extracted and dimensionality of the features were reduced using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). The reduced features were fused together and passed into a meta-classifier or stacked classifier for classification. This classifier has two levels; in the first level support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RForest) machine learning classifier were included for prediction and logistic regression in the second level for classification. The four combinations of fused models are DenseNet, ResNet, InceptionResNet, and EfficientNet. EfficientNet-based fused models showed better performances compared to other fused models and non-fused CNN-based pretrained models. Moreover, the EfficientNet-based fused models outperformed the existing approaches for Android malware detection. All the model performances were shown on two different testing datasets and the proposed model has shown the similar performances on both the testing datasets with attaining better performances during training and testing. This indicates that the proposed model is more generalizable, robust, and it can be used as tool that can be deployed in any application play store.},

  abstract = {Abstract Bytecode is a form of instruction set designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable source code, bytecode is even harder to understand for programmers and researchers. Bytecode has been widely used in various software tasks such as malware detection and clone detection. In order to understand the meaning of the bytecode more quickly and accurately and further help programmers in more software activities, we propose a bytecode comment generation method (called BCGen) using neural language model. Specifically, to get the structured information of the bytecode, we first generate the control flow graph (CFG) of the bytecode, and serialize the CFG with bytecode semantic information. Then a transformer model combining gate recurrent unit is proposed to learn the features of bytecode to generate comments. We obtain the bytecode by building the Jar packages of the well-known open-source projects in the Maven repository and construct a bytecode dataset to train and evaluate our model. Experimental results show that the BLEU of BCGen can reach 0.26, which outperforms several baselines and proves the effectiveness and practicability of our method. It is concluded that it is possible to generate natural language comments directly from the bytecode. Meanwhile, it is important to take structured and semantic information into account in generating bytecode comments.},

  abstract = {Abstract Code similarity analysis has become more popular due to its significant applicantions, including vulnerability detection, malware detection, and patch analysis. Since the source code of the software is difficult to obtain under most circumstances, binary-level code similarity analysis (BCSA) has been paid much attention to. In recent years, many BCSA studies incorporating AI techniques focus on deriving semantic information from binary functions with code representations such as assembly code, intermediate representations, and control flow graphs to measure the similarity. However, due to the impacts of different compilers, architectures, and obfuscations, binaries compiled from the same source code may vary considerably, which becomes the major obstacle for these works to obtain robust features. In this paper, we propose a solution, named UPPC (Unleashing the Power of Pseudo-code), which leverages the pseudo-code of binary function as input, to address the binary code similarity analysis challenge, since pseudo-code has higher abstraction and is platform-independent compared to binary instructions. UPPC selectively inlines the functions to capture the full function semantics across different compiler optimization levels and uses a deep pyramidal convolutional neural network to obtain the semantic embedding of the function. We evaluated UPPC on a data set containing vulnerabilities and a data set including different architectures (X86, ARM), different optimization options (O0-O3), different compilers (GCC, Clang), and four obfuscation strategies. The experimental results show that the accuracy of UPPC in function search is 33.2\% higher than that of existing methods.},

  abstract = {Obfuscation is used to protect programs from analysis and reverse engineering. There are theoretically effective and resistant obfuscation methods, however, most of them are not implemented in practice yet. The main issues are the large overhead for the execution of obfuscated code and the limitation of application only to a specific class of programs. On the other hand, a large number of obfuscation methods have been developed that are applied in practice. The existing approaches to the assessment of such obfuscation methods are based mainly on the static characteristics of programs. Therefore, the comprehensive (taking into account the dynamic characteristics of programs) justification of their effectiveness and resistance is a relevant task. It seems that such a justification can be made using machine learning methods based on feature vectors that describe both static and dynamic characteristics of programs. In this paper, it is proposed to build such a vector on the basis of characteristics of two compared programs: the original and obfuscated, original and deobfuscated, obfuscated and deobfuscated. In order to obtain the dynamic characteristics of the program, a scheme based on a symbolic execution is constructed and presented in this paper. The choice of the symbolic execution is justified by the fact that such characteristics can describe the difficulty of comprehension of the program in dynamic analysis. This paper proposes two implementations of the scheme: extended and simplified. The extended scheme is closer to the process of analyzing a program by an analyst, since it includes the steps of disassembly and translation into intermediate code, while in the simplified scheme these steps are excluded. In order to identify the characteristics of symbolic execution that are suitable for assessing the effectiveness and resistance of obfuscation based on machine learning methods, experiments with the developed schemes were carried out. Based on the obtained results, a set of suitable characteristics is determined.},

Since the signature-based methods fall short for detecting malicious software effectively considering the vast number of applications, machine learning techniques in this field have also become widespread. In this context, stating the acquired accuracy values in the contingency tables in malware detection studies has become a popular and efficient method and enabled researchers to evaluate their methodologies comparatively. In this study, we wanted to investigate and emphasize the factors that may affect the accuracy values of the models managed by researchers, particularly the disassembly method and the input data characteristics. Firstly, we developed a model that tackles the malware detection problem from a Natural Language Processing (NLP) perspective using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Then, we experimented with different base units (instruction, basic block, method, and class) and representations of source code obtained from three commonly used disassembling tools (JEB, IDA, and Apktool) and examined the results. Our findings exhibit that the disassembly method and different input representations affect the model results. More specifically, the datasets collected by the Apktool achieved better results compared to the other two disassemblers.},

  abstract = {Abstract Android is the most widely used mobile platform, making it a prime target for malicious attacks. Therefore, it is imperative to effectively circumvent these attacks. Recently, machine learning has been a promising solution for malware detection, which relies on distinguishing features. While machine learning-based malware scanners have a large number of features, adversaries can avoid detection by using feature-related expertise. Therefore, one of the main tasks of the Android security industry is to consistently propose cutting-edge features that can detect suspicious activity. This study presents a novel feature representation approach for malware detection that combines API-Call Graphs (ACGs) with byte-level image representation. First, the reverse engineering procedure is used to obtain the Java programming codes and Dalvik Executable (DEX) file from Android Package Kit (APK). Second, to depict Android apps with high-level features, we develop ACGs by mining API-Calls and API sequences from Control Flow Graph (CFG). The ACGs can act as a digital fingerprint of the actions taken by Android apps. Next, the multi-head attention-based transfer learning method is used to extract trained features vector from ACGs. Third, the DEX file is converted to a malware image, and the texture features are extracted and highlighted using a combination of FAST (Features from Accelerated Segment Test) and BRIEF (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features). Finally, the ACGs and texture features are combined for effective malware detection and classification. The proposed method uses a customized dataset prepared from the CIC-InvesAndMal2019 dataset and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 99.27\% accuracy.},

REveal is based on the detection of Function Call Graph (FCG) approximate isomorphism and improves both speed and accuracy, mainly by the use of two techniques. First, we propose the use of hierarchical Community Detection (CD) in executables’ FCGs, for the purpose of detecting groups of densely connected functions, thus partitioning them in smaller groups. Moreover, we use Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for further grouping of similar functions in hash buckets. Both techniques are used in a divide-and-conquer fashion to simplify the diffing process of the programs being compared, practically reducing it to diffing of their FCG communities and LSH buckets.},

  abstract = {Malware authors focus on deceiving and evading Anti Malware Engines (AME). Evasion attacks take in malware samples and modify those samples to by-pass ml based AME. Existing learning based anti-malware solutions are either too limited or insufficient to neutralize the threats arising from evasion attacks. This has necessitated a more comprehensive and robust solution. This research attempts to develop a secure learning framework entitled, damroc. The objective is to shield anti-malware entities against evasion attacks by making use of an adaptive adversarial training framework with novel retraining sample selector, (DAM-ROC OR) for dnn based learners. Usage of bnn along with possible quantification of predictive uncertainties is adapted. This generic framework, DAM-ROC is evaluated on benchmarked Android and Windows datasets to explore necessary trade-off between performance and robustness. DAM-ROC models are retrained to defend against gradient attacks like rBIMk, dBIMk, GRAMS and JSMA. Empirical results show that proposed DAM-ROC framework could increase robustness against multiple evasion attacks without compromising on performance when compared against two existing frameworks, SLEIPNIR and KBL. GRAMS retrained Bayesian models have demonstrated consistent performance against all considered attacks which is crucial for real world scenarios since it cannot be predicted in advance which attack will be deployed.},

These allow developers to build privacy-conscious apps that detect whether an infected individual is in close proximity with others. Given the urgency of the problem, these apps have been developed at an accelerated rate with a brief testing period. Such quick development may have led to mistakes in the apps’ implementations, resulting in problems with their functionality, privacy and security. To mitigate these concerns, we develop and apply a methodology for evaluating the functionality, privacy and security of Android apps using the Google/Apple Exposure Notification API. This is a three-pronged approach consisting of a manual analysis, general static analysis and a bespoke static analysis, using a tool we have developed, dubbed MonSTER. As a result, we have found that, although most apps met the basic standards outlined by Google/Apple, there are issues with the functionality of some of these apps that could impact user safety.},

It starts with civil law and the necessity to address security requirements and specifications in individual contractual terms. Data and consumer protection laws have not helped much, mainly because of missing definitions and levels of applicable security. Two new EU directives reforming the law of obligations may improve the situation for consumers since security is now a named quality requirement, especially for the sale of (digital) goods. Also introduced is the provision of security updates as a contractual duty. But both rule sets address only the traders, not the producers. This is different with the activation of clauses in the radio equipment directive, which sets IT security measures as requirements to be compliant for CE labeling. An important element is the introduction of a vulnerability management system. Details can be found in the draft of technical standard ETSI/EN 303645. The work concludes with a look at the EU’s efforts regarding certification schemes and the interaction of all regulation elements, with more liability for insecure products plus the hope for effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Android security permissions are built-in security features that constrain what an app can do and access on the system, that is, its privileges. Permissions have been widely used for Android malware detection, mostly in combination with other relevant app attributes. The available set of permissions is dynamic, refined in every new Android OS version release. The refinement process adds new permissions and deprecates others. These changes directly impact the type and prevalence of permissions requested by malware and legitimate applications over time. Furthermore, malware trends and benign apps’ inherent evolution influence their requested permissions. Therefore, the usage of these features in machine learning-based malware detection systems is prone to concept drift issues. Despite that, no previous study related to permissions has taken into account concept drift. In this study, we demonstrate that when concept drift is addressed, permissions can generate long-lasting and effective malware detection systems. Furthermore, the discriminatory capabilities of distinct set of features are tested. We found that the initial set of permissions, defined in Android 1.0 (API level 1), are sufficient to build an effective detection model, providing an average 0.93 F1 score in data that spans seven years. In addition, we explored and characterized permissions evolution using local and global interpretation methods. In this regard, the varying importance of individual permissions for malware and benign software recognition tasks over time are analyzed.},

That issue can be used to steal the remuneration of validator nodes. This paper proposes a patch based on appropriate code rewriting. Namely, smart contracts are pieces of code that are deployed and executed in the context of a blockchain infrastructure in order to automatically enforce some effects when particular events occur. The writing of smart contracts is a complex and critical activity that can benefit from the use of high-level features of programming languages, and generics is one of them. In many programming languages, such as Java, generics are implemented by erasure , i.e. replaced by their upper bound type during compilation into bytecode. This is safe at source level, since the compiler takes care of checking that types are correct, before erasure. However, the erased types of the generated bytecode are consequently weaker. In a permissionless blockchain, where every user can call the bytecode of smart contracts installed by other users, these weaker types pose a risk of attack.},

In this work, we perform a literature review to understand the state of the art of energy inefficiency diagnosis for Android applications. We identified 55 research papers published in recent years and classified existing studies from four different perspectives, including power estimation method, hardware component, types of energy defects, and program analysis approach. We also did a cross-perspective analysis to summarize and compare our studied techniques.

  abstract = {Abstract As the smartphone market leader, Android has been a prominent target for malware attacks. The number of malicious applications (apps) identified for it has increased continually over the past decade, creating an immense challenge for all parties involved. For market holders and researchers, in particular, the large number of samples has made manual malware detection unfeasible, leading to an influx of research that investigate Machine Learning (ML) approaches to automate this process. However, while some of the proposed approaches achieve high performance, rapidly evolving Android malware has made them unable to maintain their accuracy over time. This has created a need in the community to conduct further research, and build more flexible ML pipelines. Doing so, however, is currently hindered by a lack of systematic overview of the existing literature, to learn from and improve upon the existing solutions. Existing survey papers often focus only on parts of the ML process (e.g., data collection or model deployment), while omitting other important stages, such as model evaluation and explanation. In this paper, we address this problem with a review of 42 highly-cited papers, spanning a decade of research (from 2011 to 2021). We introduce a novel procedural taxonomy of the published literature, covering how they have used ML algorithms, what features they have engineered, which dimensionality reduction techniques they have employed, what datasets they have employed for training, and what their evaluation and explanation strategies are. Drawing from this taxonomy, we also identify gaps in knowledge and provide ideas for improvement and future work.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mobile apps represent essential tools in our daily routines, supporting us in almost every task. However, this assistance might imply a high cost in terms of privacy. Indeed, mobile apps gather a massive amount of data about individuals (e.g., users’ profiles and habits) and their devices (e.g., locations), where not all are strictly needed for app execution. According to privacy laws, apps’ providers must inform end-users on adopted data usage practices (e.g., which data are collected and for which purpose). Unfortunately, understanding these practices is a complex task for average end-users. The result is that they install apps without understanding their privacy implications. To support users in making more privacy-aware decisions on app usage, we propose a risk estimation approach based on an analysis of the app’s code. This analysis adopts a hybrid strategy, exploiting static and dynamic code analyses. Static analysis aims at discovering which personal data an app is collecting to determine whether the target app is asking more than required. This gives the first estimation of the app’s risk level. In addition, we also perform a dynamic analysis of the target app’s code. This further analysis helps determining whether the collected personal data is consumed locally on the mobile device or sent out to external services. If this happens, the risk level has to be increased, as personal data are more exposed. To prove the proposal’s effectiveness, we run several experiments involving different groups of participants. The obtained accuracy results are promising and outperform those obtained with static analysis only.},

  abstract = {App responsiveness is the most intuitive interpretation of App performance from the users’ perspective. Traditional performance profilers only focus on one type of program activity (e.g., CPU profiling). In contrast, the cause of slow responsiveness can be diverse or even due to the joint effect of multiple kinds. Also, various test configurations, such as device hardware and wireless connectivity, can dramatically impact particular program activities and indirectly affect App responsiveness. Conventional mobile testing lacks mechanisms to reveal configuration-sensitive bugs. In this paper, we propose AppSPIN, a tool to diagnose App responsiveness bugs and systematically explore configuration-sensitive bugs automatically. AppSPIN instruments the App to collect program events and UI responsiveness. The instrumented App is exercised with automated monkey testers, and AppSPIN correlates excessive and lengthy program events with poor responsiveness detected at runtime. The diagnosis process also synthesizes the major resource bottleneck for the App under test. After one test run, AppSPIN automatically alters the test configuration with most bottlenecked resources to further explore responsiveness bugs that occur only with particular test configurations. Our experiments with 30 real-world Apps show that AppSPIN can detect 123 unique responsiveness bugs and successfully diagnose the cause for 87\% cases with an average of 15-minute test time and negligible overhead. Also, with altered test configurations, AppSPIN uncovers a considerable number of new bugs within four extra test runs.},

  abstract = {Android smartphones are employed widely due to its flexible programming system with several user-oriented features in daily lives. With the substantial growth rate of smartphone technologies, cyber-attack against such devices has surged at an exponential rate. Majority of the smartphone users grant permission blindly to various arbitrary applications and hence it weakens the efficiency of the authorization mechanism. Numerous approaches were established in effective malware detection, but due to certain limitations like low identification rate, low malware detection rate as well as category detection, the results obtained are ineffective. Therefore, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network based adaptive red fox optimization (CNN-ARFO) approach to detect the malware applications as benign or malware. The proposed approach comprising of three different phases namely the pre-processing phase, feature extraction phase and the detection phase for the effective detection of android malware applications. In the pre-processing phase, the selected dataset utilizes Minmax technique to normalize the features. Then the malicious APK and the collected benign apps are investigated to identify and extract the essential features for the proper functioning of malware in the extraction phase. Finally, the android mobile applications are detected using CNN based ARFO approach. Then the results based on detecting the benign and malicious applications from the android mobiles are demonstrated by evaluating certain parameters like model accuracy rate, model loss rate, accuracy, precision, recall and f-measure. The resulting outcome revealed that the detection accuracy achieved by the proposed approach is 97.29\%.},

  abstract = {Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are being widely used in a variety of embedded applications. Due to their programmable feature, FPGAs are the perfect choice for various hardware-based systems. In many of the competing types of FPGAs, the dominant types are Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) based which can be reprogrammed at any stage of execution of a job. SRAM-based FPGAs are volatile and need an external memory to store configuration bitstream that is vulnerable to attacks. In the development as well as deployment stages, the threat of malicious modifications or inserting Hardware Trojans (HTs) into the bitstream is always present. FPGA’s bitstream can be infiltrated or corrupted in a non-invasive manner that may cause fatal consequences. Therefore, a framework is proposed that uses Xilinx Design Language (XDL) or Native Circuit Description (NCD) files that can be extracted from the infected bitstream of FPGA. Xilinx Command Line tools are used to get complete information on hardware primitives, resource utilization, timing constraints, and power summaries from XDL/NCD files in textual form. Further, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been employed to extract the syntactic features from the descriptive artifact to find the malicious modifications/HTs. The proposed framework also identifies the types of the detected HTs and provides a good understanding to study the behavior of trojans. For logic implementation and testing, Xilinx ISE 14.7 along with PlanAhead TM and FPGA Editor design tools are used. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can be successfully used for the detection of malicious modifications/HTs with optimal accuracy.},

  abstract = {Abstract Modern vehicles resemble four-wheels computers connected to the Internet via their In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) systems. As with PCs in the past, cars, being connected to the Internet can be potentially vulnerable. The IVI system of a car is part of the intra-vehicle network and can be the entry-point of offensive cybersecurity attacks. The intra-vehicle network, based on the CAN protocol, is vulnerable by design : messages are exchanged in clear. Thus, the uncontrolled access to the CAN bus may have serious impact on the vehicle itself and its passengers. In this paper, we present a vulnerability assessment, through a reverse engineering process, of Kia vehicles IVI system. In particular, we focused on reverse engineer the Kia IVI system to discover vulnerabilities that may allow an attacker to compromise the IVI functionalities and inject CAN frames into the CAN bus to alter the behaviour of (part of) the vehicle. By reverse engineering the IVI, we identified four important vulnerabilities that affect all Kia vehicles that embed the studied IVI. Finally, we show how an attacker can easily control the IVI and inject CAN bus frames by means of a Metasploit module that we wrote.},

  abstract = {To accurately find malware in a large number of mobile APPs, and determine which family it belongs to is one of the most important challenges in Android malware detection. Existed research focuses on using the extracted features to distinguish Android malicious APPs, and less attention is paid to the category and family classification of Android malware. Meanwhile, feature selection has always been a choose-difficult issue in malware detection with machine learning methods. In this paper, SelAttConvLstm was designed to classify android malware by category and family without manually selecting features. To identify Android malware, we first convert all the network traffic flows into grayscale images according to chronological order through data preprocessing. Second, we design SelAttConvLstm, a deep learning model to detect malicious Android APPs with network flows images. This model can consider both the spatial and temporal features of network flow at the same time. In addition, to improve the performance of the model, self-attention weights are added to focus on different features of the input. Finally, comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the detection model. Experimental results showed that our method can not only effectively detect malware, but also classify malware in detail and accurately by category and family.},

  abstract = {Third-party libraries are a key building block in software development as they allow developers to reuse common functionalities instead of reinventing the wheel. However, third-party libraries and client projects are developed and continuously evolving in an asynchronous way. As a result, outdated third-party libraries might be commonly used in client projects, while developers are unaware of the potential risk (e.g., security bugs) in usages. Outdated third-party libraries might be updated in client projects in a delayed way, while developers are less aware of the potential risk (e.g., API incompatibilities) in updates. Developers of third-party libraries may be unaware of how their third-party libraries are used or updated in client projects. Therefore, a quantitative and holistic study on usages, updates and risks of third-party libraries in open-source projects can provide concrete evidence on these problems, and practical insights to improve the ecosystem sustainably. In this paper, we make the first contribution towards such a study in the Java ecosystem. First, using 806 open-source projects and 13,565 third-party libraries, we conduct a library usage analysis (e.g., usage intensity and usage outdatedness), followed by a library update analysis (e.g., update intensity and update delay). The two analyses aim to quantify usage and update practices from the two holistic perspectives of open-source projects and third-party libraries. Then, we carry out a library risk analysis (e.g., usage risk and update risk) on 806 open-source projects and 544 security bugs. This analysis aims to quantify the potential risk of using and updating outdated third-party libraries with respect to security bugs. Our findings suggest practical implications to developers and researchers on problems and potential solutions in maintaining third-party libraries (e.g., smart alerting and automated updating of outdated third-party libraries). To demonstrate the usefulness of our findings, we propose a security bug-driven alerting system, named LibSecurify , for assisting developers to make confident decisions by quantifying risks and effort when updating outdated third-party libraries. 33 open-source projects have confirmed the presence of security bugs after receiving our alerts, and 24 of those 33 have updated their third-party libraries. We have released our dataset to foster valuable applications and improve the Java third-party library ecosystem.},

Inconsistency is caused by the limitations of standard development specifications and human power resources, which may impact software maintenance. To solve this problem, we propose an incremental software architecture recovery (ISAR) technique. Our technique obtains dependency information from changed code blocks and identifies different strength-level dependencies. Then, we use double classifiers to recover the architecture based on the method of mapping code-level changes to architecture-level updates. ISAR is evaluated on 10 open-source projects, and the results show that it performs more effectively and efficiently than the compared techniques. We also find that the impact of low-quality architectural documentation on effectiveness remains stable during software evolution.},

This study uses a multi-perspective declarative language to model the behavior of infected and trusted applications by discovering it from their system call traces. The obtained models are used to classify malware applications and evaluate if they belong to a known malware family. The approach has been evaluated on a dataset obtained by capturing system call traces from more than 160 K trusted and infected applications, the latter gathered from 27 known malware families. The empirical study shows the good performance of the approach in the identification of the infected applications and their membership to a specific malware family. In addition, the approach exhibits a high level of robustness to code transformations and major evasion techniques.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Android application framework has a pervasive presence. In early 2021, Android has over \$\$70\\\%\$\$ 70 \% share of the operating system mobile market (according to GlobalStats ). Components are the main building blocks of Android Applications. These blocks communicate via a rich Inter-Component Communication (ICC) model rather than the traditional inter-process communication model. , -filters, and their resolution (matching) algorithm are main elements of the ICC. However, the resolution algorithm is not robust enough and has flaws that can lead to security breaches. In this paper, we present DLAIR, as an enrichment of the resolution algorithm to overcome its security issues. To this end, we start by presenting a formal model to express and validate the ICC semantics. This includes defining key properties guaranteeing consistent and realistic semantic states. We then demonstrate how the semantics can be used to formally validate ICC aspects and to express and check ICC system updates. We verified our proposed model and all its lemmas and theorems in the Coq Proof Assistant, a machine-assisted verification tool. We extend our semantics to develop DLAIR which is assisted by a heuristic, and lightweight tool, LekInt. This tool identifies suspicious execution paths responsible for based sensitive user-information leakage. On a dataset of 2000 real-world apps, we evaluated LekInt against Flowdroid, a state-of-the-art information leakage analysis tool. Experiments show that LekInt is more effective and efficient than Flowdroid which has a higher false-negative rate and lower false-positive rate than LekInt. Considering the dynamic context in which LekInt is designed to work, the advantage of efficiency overcomes the disadvantage of higher false-negative.},

This procedure is time consuming and strongly depends on the skills of experts. In addition, malware can be packed or encrypted to evade the analysis of decompiling tools. To solve this issue, we propose a static detection method based on deep learning. We directly extract bytecode file from Android APK file, and convert the bytecode file into a two-dimensional bytecode matrix, then use the deep learning algorithm, convolution neural network (CNN), to train a detection model and apply it to classify malware. CNN can automatically learn features of bytecode file which can be used to recognize malware. The proposed detection model avoids the procedure for analyzing malware features and designing the feature representation of malware. The experimental results show the proposed method is effective to detect malware, especially malware encrypted using polymorphic techniques.},

  abstract = {Recently, the quality of user interface design has become a major factor in the success of mobile applications. To this end, the evaluation of Mobile User Interface (MUIs) is a mandatory step. Generally, there exist two main categories of user interface evaluation methods: manual and automatic. The manual evaluation is conducted by users or experts to assess the MUIs and verify whether it works as intended. However, it is more time-consuming task. Automatic evaluation is based on an automatic tool, which needs preconfiguration in the source code. But, this manual configuration is a tedious task for non-programmer evaluators. To address this issue, we propose an evaluation approach based on the analysis of graphical MUI as screenshot without using the source code and user involvement. The proposed approach combines the GoogleNet architecture and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier to evaluate the MUIs. First, we apply the Borderline-SMOTE method to obtain a balanced dataset. Then, the GoogleNet is used to extract automatically the features of MUI. Finally, we apply the KNN classifier to classify the MUIs as good or bad. We evaluate this approach based on publicly available large-scale datasets having more number of good ratings than bad ratings which may have an impact on the proposed model during the learning step. To this end, the Borderline-SMOTE method (BSM) is used to obtain a balanced class distribution. The obtained results are very promising.},

Unfortunately, in addition to this, the number of cyber-attacks related to mobile platforms is increasing day-by-day. However, although advances in Artificial Intelligence science have allowed addressing many aspects of the problem, malware classification tasks are still challenging. For this reason, the following paper aims to propose new special features, called permission maps (Perm-Maps), which combine information related to the Android permissions and their corresponding severity levels. Such features have proven to be very effective in classifying different malware families through the usage of a convolutional neural network. Also, the advantages introduced by the Perm-Maps have been enhanced by a training process based on a federated logic. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves up to a 3\% improvement in average accuracy with respect to J48 trees and Naive Bayes classifier, and up to 16\% compared to multi-layer perceptron classifier. Furthermore, the combined use of Perm-Maps and federated logic allows dealing with unbalanced training datasets with low computational efforts.},

  abstract = {Ethereum blockchain is a new internetware with tens of millions of smart contracts running on it. Different from general programs, smart contracts are decentralized, tamper-resistant and permanently running. Moreover, to avoid resource abuse, Ethereum charges users for deploying and invoking smart contracts according to the size of contract and the operations executed by contracts. It is necessary to optimize smart contracts to save money. However, since developers are not familiar with the operating environment of smart contracts (i.e., Ethereum virtual machine) or do not pay attention to resource consumption during development, there are many optimization opportunities for smart contracts. To fill this gap, this paper defines six gas-inefficient patterns from more than 25 000 posts and proposes an optimization approach at the source code level to let users know clearly where the contract is optimized. To evaluate the prevalence and economic benefits of gas-inefficient patterns, this paper conducts an empirical study on more than 160 000 real smart contracts. The promising experimental results demonstrate that 52.75\% of contracts contain at least one gas-inefficient pattern proposed in this paper. If these patterns are removed from the contract, at least \$0.30 can be saved per contract.},

  abstract = {Repackaging brings serious threats to Android ecosystem. Software birthmark techniques are typically applied to detect repackaged apps. Birthmarks based on apps’ runtime graphical user interfaces (GUI) are effective, especially for obfuscated or encrypted apps. However, existing studies are time-consuming and not suitable for handling apps in large scale. In this paper, we propose an effective yet efficient dynamic GUI birthmark for Android apps. Briefly, we run an app with automatically generated GUI events and dump its layout after each event. We divide each dumped layout into a grid, count in each grid cell the vertices of boundary rectangles corresponding to widgets within the layout, and generate a feature vector to encode the layout. Similar layouts are merged at runtime, and finally we obtain a graph as the birthmark of the app. Given a pair of apps to be compared, we build a weighted bipartite graph from their birthmarks and apply a modified version of the maximum-weight-bipartite-matching algorithm to determine whether they form a repackaging pair (RP) or not. We implement the proposed technique in a prototype, GridDroid, and apply it to detect RPs in three datasets involving 527 apks. GridDroid reports only six false negatives and seven false positives, and it takes GridDroid merely 20 microseconds on average to compare a pair of birthmarks.},

Results show that HMTBT transparently achieves 24\% performance improvements and 54\% energy savings over an OoO superscalar processor coupled to an ARM NEON engine.

Therefore, the identification and removal of unused TPLs present in an application are desirable. We present a rapid, storage-efficient, obfuscation-resilient method to detect the irrelevant-TPLs in Java and Python applications. Our approach’s novel aspects are i) Computing a vector representation of a .class file using a model that we call Lib2Vec. The Lib2Vec model is trained using the Paragraph Vector Algorithm. ii) Before using it for training the Lib2Vec models, a .class file is converted to a normalized form via semantics-preserving transformations. iii) A e Xtra Lib rary D etector (XtraLibD) developed and tested with 27 different language-specific Lib2Vec models. These models were trained using different parameters and >30,000 .class and >478,000 .py files taken from >100 different Java libraries and 43,711 Python available at MavenCentral.com and Pypi.com, respectively.

This chapter discusses the development of an anomaly detection system for a SEL-3505 RTAC programmable logic controller using the recommended IEC 61131 programming tools. The required device statistics are harvested by creating a Modbus server on the test system and polling the server to retrieve data. The collected data is used to create a representative fingerprint for the associated task. When the measured behavior differs from the fingerprint, an anomaly is detected and an alarm is raised. This approach is flexible and easily implemented in existing installations. The performance of the anomaly detection system is evaluated against several network-based attacks across multiple firmware revisions and project types. Recommendations are made to improve anomaly detection performance.},

  abstract = {Compiler correctness is an old problem, but with the emergence of smart contracts on blockchains that problem presents itself in a new light. Smart contracts are self-contained pieces of software that control (valuable) assets in an adversarial environment; once committed to the blockchain, these smart contracts cannot be modified. Smart contracts are typically developed in a high-level contract language and compiled to low-level virtual machine code before being committed to the blockchain. For a smart contract user to trust a given piece of low-level code on the blockchain, they must convince themselves that (a) they are in possession of the matching source code and (b) that the compiler has correctly translated the source code to the given low-level code. Classic approaches to compiler correctness tackle the second point. We argue that translation certification also squarely addresses the first. We describe the proof architecture of a novel translation certification framework, implemented in Coq, for a functional smart contract language. We demonstrate that we can model the compilation pipeline as a sequence of translation relations that facilitate a modular verification methodology and are robust in the face of an evolving compiler implementation.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of smart power grid, the security of intelligent terminal has been widely concerned. Firmware is the core component of intelligent terminal equipment, and its vulnerability has become one of the main threats to intelligent terminal security. However, the difficulty of obtaining firmware, extracting binary files and analyzing code bring a series of difficulties to firmware vulnerability mining, resulting in low accuracy and high false positive rate of vulnerability mining. Therefore, this paper proposes a firmware vulnerability mining method based on code property graph. First, generate the code property graph of the target program; secondly, abstract syntax tree, control flow graph and data dependency graph are extracted from code property graph. Then the traversal analysis of these three graphs gradually reduces the scope of the vulnerability; Finally, combined with manual analysis and review, the results of vulnerability mining are obtained. In this paper, joern tool is used to verify the DVRF project, mining stack overflow vulnerability, heap overflow vulnerability, command injection vulnerability and heap release vulnerability, and good experimental results are obtained.},

The challenge of the problem is the difficulty to extract sufficient information from the minority class. As a result, the classifier converges to a sub-optimal state. While methods based on resampling and reweighing the cost for different classes are the common strategies to address the problem, there are still numerous issues with these methods such as under- or over-sampling that may remove necessary information or introduce noise, respectively; and reweighing may result in an inappropriate cost matrix. To address the above shortcomings, in this paper, an enhanced approach based on informative samples is proposed. In our approach, the classifier can indicate which class a sample is closer to by comparing it with boundary samples. The informative samples include the samples from both positive and negative samples located around the boundary.

The main reason for its popularity is the wide range of functionality available at an affordable cost. Moreover, millions of android-based free applications are easily available for users on the android market store, that is, Play Store. Because of the expanded user base globally, there is a significant rise in cyber-attacks on android devices in the last decade so as to have large impact. The main goals of the attackers are to gain access to these devices and steal private as well as confidential information stored on these devices. There is a wide variety of android malware specifically designed for these devices with the capability of spreading and propagation. Even some of the android malware code is written in such a way that they have the capability to evade the detection system. Various frameworks and technologies are used for the detection of android malware but still, attackers are finding new ways to evade detection. Meanwhile, blockchain technology is emerging and has proved its worth in various sectors. In this paper, we reviewed the use cases of blockchain technology for the detection of android malware which manifests the capability and effectiveness of this emerging technology to secure ubiquitous mobile cyber-infrastructure.},

This includes arbitrary re-entrancy which is a major source of bugs and attacks in smart contracts.

  abstract = {Like websites, mobile apps import a range of external resources from various third-party domains. In succession, the third-party domains can further load resources hosted on other domains. For each mobile app, this creates a dependency chain underpinned by a form of implicit trust between the app and transitively connected third-parties. Hence, a such implicit trust may leave apps’ developers unaware of what resources are loaded within their apps. In this work, we perform a large-scale study of dependency chains in 7,048 free Android mobile apps. We characterize the third-party resources used by apps and explore the presence of potentially malicious resources loaded via implicit trust. We find that around 94\% of apps (with a number of installs greater than 500K) load resources from implicitly trusted parties. We find several different types of resources, most notably JavaScript codes, which may open the way to a range of exploits. These JavaScript codes are implicitly loaded by 92.3\% of Android apps. Using VirusTotal, we classify 1.18\% of third-party resources as suspicious. Our observations raise concerns for how apps are currently developed, and suggest that more rigorous vetting of in-app third-party resource loading is required.},

  abstract = {In the past years, a number of static application security testing tools have been proposed which use so-called code property graphs (CPGs), a graph model which keeps rich information about the source code while enabling its user to write language-agnostic analyses. However, they suffer from several shortcomings. They work mostly on source code and exclude the analysis of third-party dependencies if they are only available as compiled binaries. Furthermore, they are limited in their analysis to whether an individual programming language is supported or not. While often support for well-established languages such as C/C++ or Java is included, languages that are still heavily evolving, such as Rust, are not considered because of the constant changes in the language design. To overcome these limitations, we extend an open source implementation of a code property graph to support LLVM-IR which can be used as output by many compilers and binary lifters. In this paper, we discuss how we address challenges that arise when mapping concepts of an intermediate representation to a CPG. At the same time, we optimize the resulting graph to be minimal and close to the representation of equivalent source code. Our case-study on detecting cryptographic misuse indicates that existing analyses can be reused and that the analysis time is comparable to operating on source code. This makes the approach suitable for a security analysis of large-scale projects.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we outline a novel form of attack we refer to as Op portunistic Al gorithmic Double-Spending ( OpAl ). OpAl attacks avoid equivocation , i.e., do not require conflicting transactions, and are carried out automatically in case of a fork. Algorithmic double-spending is facilitated through transaction semantics that dynamically depend on the context and ledger state at the time of execution. Hence, OpAl evades common double-spending detection mechanisms and can opportunistically leverage forks, even if the malicious sender themselves is not responsible for, or even actively aware of, any fork. Forkable ledger designs with expressive transaction semantics, especially stateful EVM-based smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, are particularly vulnerable. Hereby, the cost of modifying a regular transaction to opportunistically perform an OpAl attack is low enough to consider it a viable default strategy. While Bitcoin’s stateless UTXO model, or Cardano’s EUTXO model, appear more robust against OpAl , we nevertheless demonstrate scenarios where transactions are semantically malleable and thus vulnerable. To determine whether OpAl -like semantics can be observed in practice, we analyze the execution traces of \\(922\\,562\\) transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Hereby, we are able to identify transactions, which may be associated with frontrunning and MEV bots, that exhibit some of the design patterns also employed as part of the herein presented attack.},

  abstract = {Network traffic analysis is an appealing approach for the security auditing of mobile apps. Prior research employs various techniques (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle, TCPDUMP) to capture network traffic from apps and further recognize security/privacy risks inside. However, these techniques suffer from limitations such as traffic mixing, proxy evasion, and SSL pinning. Possible solutions are to modify and customize the Android system. However, existing studies are mainly based on Android OS 6/7. Contemporary apps generally cannot work properly on these archaic Android OS, which has become a stumbling block for further traffic analysis research. To address the above problems, we propose a new network traffic analysis framework-TraceDroid. We first leverage the dynamic hooking technique to hook the critical functions for sending network requests, and then save the request data along with code execution traces. Besides, TraceDroid proposes an unsupervised way to identify third-party libraries (TPLs) inside apps for facilitating the liability analysis between apps and TPLs. Utilizing TraceDroid, we conduct a large-scale experiment on 9,771 real-world apps to make an empirical study of the status quo of privacy leakage. Our findings show that TPLs account for 44.45\% of privacy leakage in contemporary apps, and files transmitted from user devices contain much more detailed privacy data than network requests. We bring to light the over-data harvest and cross-library data harvest issues in apps. Furthermore, we unveil the relationship between TPLs and their visiting domains that previous research has never discussed.},

  abstract = {Serving communications security, identity authentication, etc., cryptographic algorithms constitute the cornerstone of cyberspace security. During the past decades, cryptanalysts have proved that many once prevailing cryptographic algorithms (e.g., MD4, MD5, 3DES, RC4) are no longer secure now. However, insecure cryptographic algorithms are still widely deployed in practice, seriously endangering the security of cyberspace. The reasons for this dilemma are many-fold, one of which is difficult to detect the algorithms used in the legacy binaries. Most of the existing detecting methods of cryptographic algorithms, either require source code analysis (i.e., white-box testing) or depend on the dynamic execution information (i.e., dynamic testing), narrowing the testing scope where the source codes of commercial software are not provided and the running environment may be difficult to deploy. In this paper, we propose a method of static black-box testing of cryptographic algorithms, which can identify a specific algorithm based on the corresponding data characteristics. We have implemented the testing method and used it to check 150 binaries of three types, including cryptographic libraries, commonly-used programs that use cryptographic algorithms, and general-purpose Github projects without cryptographic algorithms. The empirical results demonstrate that 80.6\% of the insecure cryptographic algorithm are implemented in the test files that contain the cryptographic algorithms. The false negative rate and false positive rate were 2.10\% and 1.68\% using our method. Moreover, we found that the insecure cryptographic algorithms (i.e., MD4, SHA-1) is still exist in some popular software, e.g., MbedTLS and 7-Zip.},

In this work, we propose an approach for obfuscation-resistant fine-grained detection of code clones in Android apps at the bytecode level. To mitigate inherent constraints of static analysis and to achieve obfuscation resistance, we partially simulate the execution of Android code, and abstract the resulting execution traces.

  abstract = {Smartphone has become the 4 th basic necessity of human being after Food, Cloths and Home. It has become an integral part of the life that most of the business and office work can be operated by mobile phone and the demand for online classes demand for all class of students have become a compulsion without any alternate due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Android is considered as the most prevailing and used operating system for the mobile phone on this planet and for the same reason it is the most targeted mobile operating system by the hackers. Android malware has been increasing every quarter and every year. An android malware is installed and executed on the smartphones quietly without any indication and user’s acceptance, that possess threats to the consumer’s personal and/or classified information stored. To address these threats, varieties of techniques have been proposed by the researchers like Static, Dynamic and Hybrid. In this paper a systematic review has been carried out on the relevant studies from 2017 to 2020. Assessment of the malware detection capabilities of various techniques used by different researchers has been carried out with comparison of the performance of different machine learning models for the detection of android malwares by assessing the results of empirical evidences such as datasets, features, tools, etc. However the android malware detection still faces several challenges and the possible solution with some novel approach or technique to improve the detection capabilities is discussed in the discussion and conclusion.},

  abstract = {The fast pace of modern development paradigms like DevOps boosted the complexity of development pipelines. In particular, developers rely on many external assets and third-party software to build the final product and match the demanding requirements in terms of release cycles and functionalities. However, such a choice impacts all the elements of the development pipeline composing the so-called Software Supply Chain (SSC), degrading its maintainability and security. From a security standpoint, successful attacks can go unnoticed and impact many targets that use the affected software before being resolved. Unfortunately, traditional security assessment methodologies might detect the symptoms (e.g., the piece of vulnerable code) but not the cause, i.e., the attack vector and the affected asset of the SSC, failing to mitigate the risk of new attack campaigns. In this paper, we propose Sunset , a methodology with a two-fold objective. First, it allows the automatic reconnaissance of the SSC assets and dependencies to alleviate the burden of monitoring the composition of the SSC. Then, it computes a risk profile, identifying the SSC risk sources and how they can impact the final software to support the identification of the weakest points of the SSC and activate the necessary organizational and technical countermeasures to prevent future SSC attack campaigns.},

  abstract = {As 3D printing applications in industry verticals increase, researchers have been developing new attacks on additive manufacturing processes and appropriate defense techniques. A major attack category on additive manufacturing processes is printed object sabotage. If an attack causes obvious deformations, the part will be rejected before it is used. However, the inherent layer-by-layer printing process enables malicious actors to induce hidden defects in the internal layers of finished parts. The stealthiness of an attack increases its chances of evading detection and the printed part being used in an operational environment where it can cause harm. Several detection schemes have been proposed for identifying attacks on external and internal features of printed objects, but all these schemes have detection thresholds that are well above printer accuracy. Reducing the attack magnitude to the order of printer accuracy can evade detection. This chapter describes two infill structure manipulation attacks that are easy to launch at the cyber-physical boundary and evade conventional cyber security tools by employing subtle printed part variations below the detection horizon. Specifically, the magnitudes of the variations fall within the printer resolution and trueness values, rendering it challenging for detection schemes to differentiate printed part modifications from benign printing errors. Destructive testing demonstrates that the infill structure manipulation attacks consistently reduce the strength of printed parts. This chapter also highlights the need to incorporate the physical characteristics of printed parts in attack detection.},

Since the control flow graph belongs to non-Euclidean structured data, it is difficult to directly use the feature extracted from its data and structure for classifying before. However, with the proposal of graph neural network, non-Euclidean graph’s classification become possible. We propose a malware family classification system based on control flow graph and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency. In this system, both the control flow graph branch structure and the instruction sequence in basic blocks are treated as input, and the graph feature representation of the malware family is generated through the graph neural network. The experimental results on the Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge dataset show that retaining the feature data of the graph structure can effectively improve the effect of family classification. And the effect can also be improved through the instruction features based on TF-IDF.},

  abstract = {Contemporary mobile applications (apps) are designed to track, use, and share users’ data, often without their consent, which results in potential privacy and transparency issues. To investigate whether mobile apps have always been (non-)transparent regarding how they collect information about users, we perform a longitudinal analysis of the historical versions of 268 Android apps. These apps comprise 5,240 app releases or versions between 2008 and 2016. We detect inconsistencies between apps’ behaviors and the stated use of data collection in privacy policies to reveal compliance issues. We utilize machine learning techniques to classify the privacy policy text and identify the purported practices that collect and/or share users’ personal information, such as phone numbers and email addresses. We then uncover the data leaks of an app through static and dynamic analysis. Over time, our results show a steady increase in the number of apps’ data collection practices that are undisclosed in the privacy policies. This behavior is particularly troubling since privacy policy is the primary tool for describing the app’s privacy protection practices. We find that newer versions of the apps are likely to be more non-compliant than their preceding versions. The discrepancies between the purported and the actual data practices show that privacy policies are often incoherent with the apps’ behaviors, thus defying the ‘notice and choice’ principle when users install apps.},

There is a growing concern that classification is at a disadvantage owing to its problems. For one thing, obtaining the crucial features of innumerable families is arduous. For another, constructing a classification model that fully learns multi-class samples is intricate. To solve these problems, it proposes a precise classification for Android family malware called CAFM in this paper. It profoundly analyzes the relationship between the information implicit in features and the degree of differentiation among families. We select the features containing context information as feature representations. In addition, it employs a specially designed deep neural network model with upgraded learning capability for grasping the continuous features of family malware utterly. Experimental verification on a real-world dataset shows that the CAFM can effectively implement family classification, and the classification accuracy reaches 97.73\% when the length of the opcode sequence is 700. Compared with other classifiers, the Kappa coefficient of the comprehensive evaluation indicator also reached 0.9725 and is at least 0.1225 higher than comparison classifiers.},

  abstract = {Acquisition of non-volatile or volatile memory is traditionally the first step in the forensic process. This approach has been widely used in mobile device investigations. However, with the advance of encryption techniques applied by default in mobile operating systems, data access is more restrictive. Investigators normally do not have administrative control over the device, which requires them to employ various techniques to acquire system data. On the other hand, application analysis is widely used in malware investigations to understand how malicious software operates without having access to the original source code. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new approach to access secure data on Android devices, based on techniques used in the field of malware analysis. Information gained through our proposed process can be used to identify implementation flaws and acquire/decode stored data. To evaluate the applicability of our approach, we analysed three applications that stored encrypted user notes. In two of the applications we identified implementation flaws that enabled acquisition of data without requiring elevated privileges.},

While mobile apps’ functionality plays a crucial role in tackling the COVID-19 spread, it is also raising concerns about the associated privacy risks that users may face. Recent research studies have showed various technological measures on mobile applications that lack consideration of privacy risks in their data practices. For example, security vulnerabilities in COVID-19 apps can be exploited and therefore also pose privacy violations. In this paper, we focus on recent and newly developed COVID-19 apps and consider their threat landscape. Our objective was to identify security vulnerabilities that can lead to user-level privacy risks. We also formalize our approach by measuring the level of risk associated with assets and services that attackers may be targeting to capture during the exploitation. We utilized baseline risk assessment criteria within the scope of three specific security vulnerabilities that often exists in COVID-19 applications namely credential leaks, insecure communication, and HTTP request libraries. We present a proof of concept implementation for risk assessment of COVID-19 apps that can be utilized to evaluate privacy risk by the impact of assets and threat likelihood.},

To combat the evolving malware attack, deep learning-based systems have been successfully developed and offer unparalleled flexibility in the automatic malware detection. However, deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and recent researches have demonstrated that adversary can leverage feature amplitude in-equilibrium to bypass malware detectors. Therefore, this paper studies a malware detection scheme AMDNN based on deep learning, it achieves the goal of defending against various adversarial attacks without obtaining detection model information and redeployment. In response to the increasing detection of massive binary applications, we propose and implement a general defense framework DQNet, which enforces the maintenance of malicious semantics through comparative regular constraints during training. Promising experimental results based on real-world datasets demonstrate that AMDNN typically provides superior classification performance and robustness to white-box attacks.},

There are a varieties of malware each of which has its intended application and purpose. With the abundance of malware on the Internet, malware detection is critical because it serves as an alert system of Internet security. Since these two platforms are the most widely used nowadays, the problem of mobile malware detection on the IoT and Android has gotten a lot of attention. For example, the BrickerBot virus discovered in 2017 in the IoT platform tries to disable IoT devices that have been improperly configured. Bots, DDoS attacks and other vulnerabilities frequently compromise the IoT network. As a result, it is pivotal to conduct a survey on the strategies employed to detect these intrusions. According to reports, malware accounts for roughly 90\% of all IoT breaches. Among these, the android devices are the worst affected. We have provided a comprehensive survey of some recent malware attacks in the IoT, as well as the most prominent malware detection techniques that uses machine learning such as static, dynamic and hybrid analysis, along with blockchain and convolutional neural network-based approaches, in this paper. We began with a broad overview of malware before moving on to IoT malware. The detecting mechanisms will be discussed in the subsequent sections of the paper.

A total of three hundred and four different machine-learned models are built using various data sampling techniques, feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms. Finally, a machine-learned model built using SVMSMOTE data sampling technique applying significant predictor metrics (SPM) feature selection methods over GDCG2H (conjugate gradient with Powell/Beale Restarts and two hidden layers) machine learning algorithm, yields a better malware predictor with area under ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.86.},

  abstract = {Mobile device coverage is increasing as the Internet develops faster and faster. Android is becoming the most popular operating system among smartphones, where it is also the most common target for malware. For the research and detection of malware, taint analysis is a very important method. By studying whether the data introduced by the taint source in the application can be directly transmitted to the taint sink without harmless treatment, we can figure out whether the application experiences privacy leaks and other security problems. Traditional dynamic taint flow analysis is needed when real-time applications are running, which occupy a large amount of memory and resources, which is relatively time-consuming and costly. An analysis of static taint involves analyzing the dependencies between program codes without running or altering the underlying code. Existing methods, however, have lower false alarm rates due to their not considering the full features. Moreover, the existing methods require a large number of data sets for training to obtain better results, and long-term training also consumes memory. Therefore, this paper designs a deep learning malware detection scheme based on privilege feature and taint feature, expanding the multidimensional calculation of feature values, constructing the feature value table based on privilege feature, taint source feature, and taint sink feature, and introducing Transformer to analyze and detect it. In this paper, additionally, a small dataset can achieve higher classification results which is a good implementation of malware detection based on the Android platform.},

  abstract = {5G network has attracted much attention from the vertical industry since its commercial use. Compared with previous generations of mobile communication technologies, 5G bandwidth, delay and other communication KPI indicators have been greatly improved. 5G network has three typical application scenarios of large bandwidth, low delay and wide connection. In the power grid scenario, it can meet the needs of various power grid business access. As the key technology to realize 5G, multi-access edge computing (MEC) plays an important role in high-speed and low delay wireless data transmission network and has made indelible contributions to improving end-to-end service quality. In view of today’s increasingly complex network security environment and changing attack means, security attacks against MEC systems and applications have become endless. In order to deal with large-scale and various attacks, this paper studies the micro application security reinforcement and independent application security reinforcement technology deployed in edge computing facilities in the environment of 5G power network, proposes the security reinforcement model of MEC, and strengthens the source code of edge computing facilities based on the so file confusion technology of OLLVM, so as to ensure the safe and stable operation of MEC.},

An UAF vulnerability occurs when a memory object has been freed, but it can still be accessed through a dangling pointer that points to the object before it is reclaimed. Since UAF vulnerabilities are frequently exploited by malware which may lead to memory data leakage or corruption, much research work has been carried out to detect UAF vulnerabilities. This paper investigates existing UAF detection methods. After comparing and categorizing these methods, an outlook on the future development of UAF detection methods is provided. This has an important reference value for subsequent research on UAF detection.},

Cyber attacks that seek to sabotage physical processes typically target the control logic of programmable logic controllers. Most of the attacks described in the literature inject malicious control logic into programmable logic controllers. This chapter presents a new type of attack that targets the control logic engine that is responsible for executing the control logic. It demonstrates that a control logic engine can be disabled by exploiting inherent features such as the program mode and starting/stopping the engine. Case studies involving control logic engine attacks on real programmable logic controllers are presented. The case studies present internal details of the logic engine attacks to enable industry and the research community to understand the control logic engine attack vector. Additionally, control engine attacks on power substation, conveyor belt and elevator testbeds are presented to demonstrate their impacts on physical systems.},

  abstract = {The importance of information security dramatically increased and will further grow due to the shape and nature of the modern computing industry. Software is published at a continuously increasing pace. The Internet of Things and security protocols are two examples of domains that pose a great security challenge, due to how diverse the needs for those software may be, and a generalisation of the capabilities regarding the toolchain necessary for testing is becoming a necessity. Oftentimes, these software are designed starting from a formal model, which can be verified with appropriate model checkers. These models, though, do not represent the actual implementation, which can deviate from the model and hence certain security properties might not be inherited from the model, or additional issues could be introduced in the implementation. In this paper we describe a proposal for a novel technique to assess software security properties from LLVM bitcode. We perform various static analyses, such as points-to analysis, call graph and control-flow graph, with the aim of deriving from them an ‘accurate enough’ formal model of the paths taken by the program, which are then going to be examined via consolidated techniques by matching them against a set of defined rules. The proposed workflow then requires further analysis with more precise methods if a rule is violated, in order to assess the actual feasibility of such path(s). This step is required as the analyses performed to derive the model to analyse are over-approximating the behaviour of the software.},

The research on the method of fundamentally expanding the data set to achieve vulnerability mining also has strong application value. Therefore, aiming at the problem of too few binary code vulnerability data sets, this paper proposes a binary code vulnerability mining model based on generation countermeasure network. In particular, the proposed system also combines automatic code generation technology, fuzzy testing and symbol execution technology to further optimize and train the generator and discriminator in the generation countermeasure network model to generate high-quality data sets. The experimental results show that, The binary code vulnerability mining model based on generative countermeasure network proposed in this paper can effectively solve the problem of too few data sets.},

We thus present DSV: a systematic and automated approach to validate whether the output of a disassembler is sound with respect to the binary. No source code, debugging information, or annotations are required. We apply DSV to 102 binaries of Coreutils with eight different state-of-the-art disassemblers from academia and industry. DSV is able to find soundness issues in the output of all these disassemblers. Using DSV to validate the output of a disassembler increases trust in any research effort built on top of it.},

Educators need to grade increasing numbers of student submissions. Unit testing can contribute to the automation of the grading process; however, it cannot assess the structure, or partial correctness, which are needed for finely differentiated grading. This paper builds on previous research that investigated several machine learning models for determining the correctness of source code. It was found that some such models can be successful, provided that the code samples used for fitting and prediction fulfil the same sets of requirements (corresponding to coding assignments). The hypothesis investigated in this paper is that code samples can be grouped by similarity of the requirements that they fulfil and that models built with samples of code from such a group can be used for determining the quality of new samples that belong to the same group, even if they do not correspond to the same coding assignment, which would make for a much more useful predictive model in practice. The investigation involved ten different machine learning algorithms used on over four hundred thousand student code submissions and it confirmed the hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Android apps interact and exchange data with other apps through so-called app components. Previous research has shown that app components can cause application-level vulnerabilities, for example leading to data leakage across apps. Alternatively, apps can (intentionally or accidentally) expose their permissions (e.g. for camera and microphone) to other apps that lack these privileges. This causes a confused deputy situation, where a less privileged app exposes its app components, which use these permissions, to the victim app. While previous research mainly focused on these issues, less attention has been paid to how app components can affect the security and privacy guarantees of Android OS. In this paper, we demonstrate two according vulnerabilities, affecting recent Android versions. First, we show how app components can be used to leak data from and, in some cases, take full control of other Android user profiles, bypassing the dedicated lock screen. We demonstrate the impact of this vulnerability on major Android vendors (Samsung, Huawei, Google and Xiaomi). Secondly, we found that app components can be abused by spyware to access sensors like the camera and the microphone in the background up to Android 10, bypassing mitigations specifically designed to prevent this behaviour. Using a two-app setup, we find that app components can be invoked stealthily to e.g. periodically take pictures and audio recordings in the background. Finally, we present Four Gates Inspector, our open-source static analysis tool to systematically detect such issues for a large number of apps with complex codebases. Our tool successfully identified exposed components issues in 34 out 5,783 apps with average analysis runtime of 4.3 s per app and, detected both known malware samples and unknown samples downloaded from the F-Droid repository. We responsibly disclosed all vulnerabilities presented in this paper to the affected vendors, leading to several CVE records and a currently unresolved high-severity issue in Android 10 and earlier.},

The second reason is that a wide variety of applications with different designs and utility can be built with ease for Android devices. With this much popularity, gaining unwanted attention of cybercriminals is inevitable. Hence, there has been a huge rise in the number of malware being developed for Android devices. To address this problem, we present ADAM (Automatic Detection of Android Malware), an Android application that uses machine learning (ML) for automatic detection of malware in Android applications. ADAM is trained with CICMalDroid 2020 Android Malware dataset and tested for both CICMalDroid 2020 and CICMalDroid 2017 dataset.

  abstract = {Malware detection has become a hot research pot as the development of Internet of Things and edge computing have grown in popularity. Specifically, various malware exploits firmware vulnerabilities on hardware platform, resulting in significant financial losses for both IoT users and edge platform providers. In this paper, we propose CodeDiff, a fresh approach for malware vulnerability detection on IoT and edge computing platforms based on the binary file similarity detection. CodeDiff is an unsupervised learning method that employs both semantic and structural information for binary diffing and does not require label data. Through the SkipGram with Negative Sampling, we generate the word vocabulary for instruction data. The Graph AutoEncoder is then used to embed both the semantic and structure information into the representation matrix for the CFG. After this, we employ the Improved Graph AutoEncoder to fuse all the function structures, function characteristics and function features to the fusion matrix. Finally, we propose the specific matrix comparison to achieve the high accuracy similarity results in short amount of time. Furthermore, we test the prototype on binary datasets OpenSSL and Curl. The results reveal that CodeDiff gives high performance on the binary file similarity detection, which contributes to identify malware vulnerability and improves the security of Internet of Things platforms.},

  abstract = {Android malware classification problem seems to have been solved with published AUC and F1 scores up to 0.99 or is it a facade, hiding an inherent problem? In this paper, we bring forward a novel method of recognising android malware using object-oriented software metrics-based dataset and deep learning. We realise that the real-world android malware is a minority class and its distribution according to 2017 Google’s android security report, and Miller et al. [ 17 ] is estimated to be about 8–12\%. The malware distribution in our dataset of 93K samples spanning over three years is around 10.9\%. In this study, four data-sampling methods, six feature selection techniques and five deep learning networks with varying hidden layers are used over the imbalanced dataset of 93K samples. A total of 120 different machine-learned models are developed, and its classification potential is compared using area under ROC curve (AUC) metric. Finally, a machine-learned model obtained using upscale sampling (USD) data-sampling method applying significant set of metrics (SGM) feature selection technique over deep learning network with two hidden layers (DL2) yields a better AUC value of 0.893681.},

  abstract = {Abstract With the rapid development of the blockchain, smart contract technology has been widely applied. The number of smart contracts has grown at a high rate and nearly at an average of thousands per day. However, the correctness and security of the smart contract itself are facing huge problems. The well-known DAO vulnerability, and Parity multi-signature wallet’ vulnerabilities have leaded to a hundreds of millions dollars loss, and they are both caused by the security problems of smart contracts. Once the smart contract vulnerability is exploited, it is very likely to bring the loss of cryptocurrencies, the disorder of the financial order and other catastrophic consequences. Therefore the security of smart contracts is imminent. This project has designed and implemented a vulnerability detection system of Ethereum smart contract. The system uses the assembly instruction sequences of the smart contract to generate the control flow graph, then performs symbolic execution and vulnerability constraint solving over the control flow. The system can detect some common types of vulnerabilities, such as the integer overflow and underflow vulnerability, reentry vulnerability and unchecked call return value vulnerability. It has a high accuracy of detection result, and gives support for export vulnerability report.},

  abstract = {The rapid development of Mobile Internet technology has caused an increasing number of Internet users. However, this technology has its advantages and disadvantages, and malware such as information leakage, Trojan horses, and push advertisements are hidden in smart terminals. Smartphones are now important tools for people to communicate with each other. Android dominates the current smartphone operating system. To effectively detect malware, reducing the detection rate and improving its detection efficiency have always been historical and challenging topics. Focusing on the problems of slow detection rate, low efficiency of malware detection as well as unsatisfactory detection rate of a single kind of feature, a framework of Android malware detection combined with multiple features, MS-MalDetect, is proposed. It mainly consists of three parts: multi-feature fusion which includes permissions, opcodes, application APIs, and hardware information, feature selection which combines Information Gain and Chi-square test to reduce the dimension of features, and Stacking which constructs Machine Learning classifiers that integrates multiple models to detect malware. Experiments show the proposed MS-MalDetect achieves 96.55\% and 98.56\% detection accuracies in different datasets and gets better performance than the compared related works.},

  abstract = {The widespread adoption of Android OS in recent years is due to its openness and flexibility. Consequently, the Android OS continues to be a prime target for serious malware attacks. Traditional malware detection methods are ineffective as Android malware use sophisticated obfuscation and adapt to the anti-virus defenses. In this paper, we present a multimodal deep learning framework, for unseen Android malware detection, called SHIELD , which employs Markov image of opcodes and dynamic APIs. SHIELD uses multimodal autoencoder (MAE) technique, which cuts down the dependency on feature engineering and automatically discovers the relevant features for malware detection. We validate our approach of unseen malware detection using the CICandMal2020 and AMD benchmarks datasets while achieving detection rates of 94\% and 87\%, respectively. Further, we created 500 obfuscated backdoor applications to evaluate the effectiveness of SHIELD with respect to other existing mobile anti-malware programs. Existing anti-malware programs fail to detect obfuscated backdoor, while SHIELD successfully flagged the obfuscated backdoor as a malicious application. SHIELD exhibits state-of-the-art performance for traditional malware detection, with an accuracy of 99.52\%.},

Experiments suggest that our proposed deep learnig detection method is able to identify Android malware with an overall classification accuracy of 97.35\% using boolean representation of the feature vector table. Comparative analysis of individual features recommends that the deep learning model resulted in better detection rate with permission feature.

  abstract = {Developing a safe application is so important as to properly install it in a system, and not an application’s tampered version. In a similar note, developers should properly care about applications’ uninstall process to avoid leaving traces of sensitive data behind in the system or interfere with the remaining applications. Until now, the academic literature has paid little attention to uninstall procedures so far. Moreover, a whole ecosystem of application uninstallers has been created, making multiple uninstallers available in software repositories. A key point is to understand how these applications work so as to develop stronger systems. To this end, we present a landscape work evaluating the operation of the 11 most downloaded uninstaller applications from the three most popular Internet software repositories. We discovered that most of these applications are not very different from the native Windows uninstaller. Although evaluated uninstallers present a more organized User Interface, thus enhancing usability, they are only able to find the same installed application as the native Windows uninstaller, but not broken installations. Few uninstallers apply heuristics to find broken application installations. However, we show that those heuristics can be abused by attackers to remove third applications. Finally, we also show that none of the removers is resistant to malicious uninstallers that terminate the remover process.},

In this paper, to assist users in their app selection process, we propose PriApp-Install, a privacy-aware app installation recommendation system. It leverages semi-supervised learning to learn individual privacy preferences w.r.t mobile app installation. Learning is done based on a rich set of features modelling both the app behavior w.r.t. personal data consumption and the benefits a user can get in installing the app. We tested four learning strategies on a real dataset by exploiting three participant groups: security and privacy experts, IT workers, and crowd workers.

To ensure the availability of PLC, we also design an inter-process communication algorithm that minimizes the overhead of HRPDF. We implement a prototype system of HRPDF and test it in a real-world PLC and an OpenPLC-based device, respectively. The results show that HRPDF can defend against multiple types of attacks with 10.22\% additional CPU and 5.56\% additional memory overhead, and about 0.6 ms additional time overhead.},

Supervised machine learning, which has been used to detect Android malware is far from perfect because it requires a significant amount of labeled data. Since labeled data is expensive and difficult to get while unlabeled data is abundant and cheap in this context, we resort to a semi-supervised learning technique, namely pseudo-label stacked auto-encoder (PLSAE), which involves training using a set of labeled and unlabeled instances. We use a hybrid approach of dynamic analysis and static analysis to craft feature vectors. We evaluate our proposed model on CICMalDroid2020, which includes 17,341 most recent samples of five different Android apps categories. After that, we compare the results with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

  abstract = {Abstract Due to the lack of established real-world benchmark suites for static taint analyses of Android applications, evaluations of these analyses are often restricted and hard to compare. Even in evaluations that do use real-world apps, details about the ground truth in those apps are rarely documented, which makes it difficult to compare and reproduce the results. To push Android taint analysis research forward, this paper thus recommends criteria for constructing real-world benchmark suites for this specific domain, and presents TaintBench , the first real-world malware benchmark suite with documented taint flows. TaintBench benchmark apps include taint flows with complex structures, and addresses static challenges that are commonly agreed on by the community. Together with the TaintBench suite, we introduce the TaintBench framework, whose goal is to simplify real-world benchmarking of Android taint analyses. First, a usability test shows that the framework improves experts’ performance and perceived usability when documenting and inspecting taint flows. Second, experiments using TaintBench reveal new insights for the taint analysis tools Amandroid and FlowDroid : (i) They are less effective on real-world malware apps than on synthetic benchmark apps. (ii) Predefined lists of sources and sinks heavily impact the tools’ accuracy. (iii) Surprisingly, up-to-date versions of both tools are less accurate than their predecessors.},

This article reports on an empirical evaluation of the tests in a corpus of projects found in the wild. We selected approximately one hundred mature projects written in each of Java, Pharo, and Python. We looked for rotten green tests in each project, taking into account test helper methods, inherited helpers, and trait composition. Previous work has shown the presence of rotten green tests in Pharo projects; the results reported here show that they are also present in Java and Python projects, and that they fall into similar categories. Furthermore, we found code bugs that were hidden by rotten tests in Pharo and Python. We also discuss two test smells — missed fail and missed skip —that arise from the misuse of testing frameworks, and which we observed in tests written in all three languages.},

  abstract = {With the proliferation of smartphone demand, the number of malicious applications has increased exponentially with about tens of thousands per month. Among smartphone platforms, the Android operating system with high popularity has become the most target by malware. By some techniques such as employing polymorphic or encrypting payload, signature-based scanning is easily bypassed. With the support from some useful tools and sandboxes recently, the Android applications could be easy to decoded and tracked the executable behavior. It leads machine learning methods to have potential benefits to classify the malware. However, how to define the suitable model with competent features and avoid over-fitting in learning models become other challenges for researchers. In this paper, we propose MINAD (Multi-Inputs Neural network based on application structure for Android malware Detection) method. First, we collect the features of an Android application based on many aspects, and then those features are grouped into three categories: System-based, Library-based, and User-based corresponding the parts of Android application structure which are related with Android system definition, library, users’ definitions. Second, each group is reconstructed to have effective feature sets. At last, a multi-input deep neural network is designed with two phases to learn the abstract of each feature group before making the final decision for malware detection. Our performances are evaluated in various samples which are collected from Google Play Store, the Drebin, and AMD Datasets with more than 155,000 samples. The results show that the MINAD method does not only improve Android malware detection’s accuracy in comparison with other methods but also improves the stability of the model and reduces the computation costs.},

  abstract = {Abstract Next to cryptocurrencies, tokens are a widespread application area of blockchains. Tokens are digital assets implemented as small programs on a blockchain. Being programmable makes them versatile and an innovative means for various purposes. Tokens can be used as investment, as a local currency in a decentralized application, or as a tool for building an ecosystem or a community. A high-level categorization of tokens differentiates between payment, security, and utility tokens. In most jurisdictions, security tokens are regulated, and hence, the distinction is of relevance. In this work, we discuss the identification of tokens on Ethereum, the most widely used token platform. The programs on Ethereum are called smart contracts, which—for the sake of interoperability—may provide standardized interfaces. In our approach, we evaluate the publicly available transaction data by first reconstructing interfaces in the low-level code of the smart contracts. Then, we not only check the compliance of a smart contract with an established interface standard for tokens, but also aim at identifying tokens that are not fully compliant. Thus, we discuss various heuristics for token identification in combination with possible definitions of a token. More specifically, we propose indicators for tokens and evaluate them on a large set of token and non-token contracts. Finally, we present first steps toward an automated classification of tokens regarding their purpose.},

  abstract = {Software development is a very broad activity that captures the entire life cycle of a software, which includes designing, programming, maintenance and so on. In this study, we focus on the maintenance-related concerns of the post-deployment of smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executed programs that run on a blockchain. They cannot be modified once deployed and hence they bring unique maintenance challenges compared to conventional software. According to the definition of ISO/IEC 14764, there are four kinds of software maintenance, i.e., corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance. This study aims to answer (i) What kinds of issues will smart contract developers encounter for corrective, adaptive, perfective, and preventive maintenance after they are deployed to the Ethereum? (ii) What are the current maintenance-related methods used for smart contracts? To obtain the answers to these research questions, we first conducted a systematic literature review to analyze 131 smart contract related research papers published from 2014 to 2020. Since the Ethereum ecosystem is fast-growing, some results from previous publications might be out-of-date and there may be a gap between academia and industry. To address this, we performed an online survey of smart contract developers on Github to validate our findings and received 165 useful responses. Based on the survey feedback and literature review, we present the first empirical study on smart contract maintenance-related concerns. Our study can help smart contract developers better maintain their smart contract-based projects, and we highlight some key future research directions to improve the Ethereum ecosystem.},

For frequency analysis, we split all API signatures into word units and grouped them according to their entropy, which is calculated by the number of the emergence of each unit words. As a result, the tool reduces 39,031 methods to 4,972 groups and 12,123 groups when including classes. This shows an approximately 69\% feature reduction rate. For classification using machine learning, 14,290 APKs from 14 different categories are collected and trained with 10,003 APKs and tested with 4,287 APKs among them. As a result, we got 98.83\% of true positive rate and 1.16\% of false positive rate on average, with 98.8\% of F-measure score.},

  abstract = {Abstract Codes of Open Source Software (OSS) are widely reused during software development nowadays. However, reusing some specific versions of OSS introduces 1-day vulnerabilities of which details are publicly available, which may be exploited and lead to serious security issues. Existing state-of-the-art OSS reuse detection work can not identify the specific versions of reused OSS well. The features they selected are not distinguishable enough for version detection and the matching scores are only based on similarity.This paper presents B2SMatcher, a fine-grained version identification tool for OSS in commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software. We first discuss five kinds of version-sensitive code features that are trackable in both binary and source code. We categorize these features into program-level features and function-level features and propose a two-stage version identification approach based on the two levels of code features. B2SMatcher also identifies different types of OSS version reuse based on matching scores and matched feature instances. In order to extract source code features as accurately as possible, B2SMatcher innovatively uses machine learning methods to obtain the source files involved in the compilation and uses function abstraction and normalization methods to eliminate the comparison costs on redundant functions across versions. We have evaluated B2SMatcher using 6351 candidate OSS versions and 585 binaries. The result shows that B2SMatcher achieves a high precision up to 89.2\% and outperforms state-of-the-art tools. Finally, we show how B2SMatcher can be used to evaluate real-world software and find some security risks in practice.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mobile platforms are rapidly and continuously changing, with support for new sensors, APIs, and programming abstractions. Static analysis is gaining a growing interest, allowing developers to predict properties about the run-time behavior of mobile apps without executing them. Over the years, literally hundreds of static analysis techniques have been proposed, ranging from structural and control-flow analysis to state-based analysis.In this paper, we present a systematic mapping study aimed at identifying, evaluating and classifying characteristics, trends and potential for industrial adoption of existing research in static analysis of mobile apps. Starting from over 12,000 potentially relevant studies, we applied a rigorous selection procedure resulting in 261 primary studies along a time span of 9 years. We analyzed each primary study according to a rigorously-defined classification framework. The results of this study give a solid foundation for assessing existing and future approaches for static analysis of mobile apps, especially in terms of their industrial adoptability .Researchers and practitioners can use the results of this study to (i) identify existing research/technical gaps to target, (ii) understand how approaches developed in academia can be successfully transferred to industry, and (iii) better position their (past and future) approaches for static analysis of mobile apps.},

Smartphones and smartwatches have become an essential tool for visually impaired and blind people in performing daily life activities, promoting independence, productivity, and self-reliance. The accessibility services such as talkback and voice assistants facilitate blind people in using smartphones to perform several activities such as placing calls, sharing pictures, reading books, and sending messages, etc. However, existing accessibility services face several problems, including late learning, accessing, and selecting non-visual items on the screen, finding objects of interest in a complex layout, multimodal interaction, and operating multiple connected devices. One solution to these problems is to design a blind-friendly interface to simplify and distribute User Interface Artefacts (UIAs), including labels, buttons, layouts, and panels across multiple devices. The framework tailor’s UI components into simplified blind-friendly user interfaces on smartphones and smartwatches, resulting in improving the user experience. Forty-nine blind people have participated in this empirical study revealing a considerable improvement in the user experience, task completion accuracy, and productivity.},

  abstract = {Android malware attacks are tremendously increasing, and evasion techniques become more and more effective. For this reason, it is necessary to continuously improve the detection performances. With this paper, we wish to pursue this purpose with two contributions. On one hand, we aim at evaluating how improving machine learning-based malware detectors, and on the other hand, we investigate to which extent adversarial attacks can deteriorate the performances of the classifiers. Analysis of malware samples is performed using static and dynamic analysis. This paper proposes a framework for integrating both static and dynamic features trained on machine learning methods and deep neural network. On employing machine learning algorithms, we obtain an accuracy of 97.59\% with static features using SVM, and 95.64\% is reached with dynamic features using Random forest. Additionally, a 100\% accuracy was obtained with CART and SVM using hybrid attributes (on combining relevant static and dynamic features). Further, using deep neural network models, experimental results showed an accuracy of 99.28\% using static features, 94.61\% using dynamic attributes, and 99.59\% by combining both static and dynamic features (also known as multi-modal attributes). Besides, we evaluated the robustness of classifiers against evasion and poisoning attack. In particular comprehensive analysis was performed using permission, APIs, app components and system calls (especially n -grams of system calls). We noticed that the performances of the classifiers significantly dropped while simulating evasion attack using static features, and in some cases 100\% of adversarial examples were wrongly labelled by the classification models. Additionally, we show that models trained using dynamic features are also vulnerable to attack, however they exhibit more resilience than a classifier built on static features.},

  abstract = {Source code plagiarism is a common occurrence in undergraduate computer science education. In order to identify such cases, many source code plagiarism detection tools have been proposed. A source code plagiarism detection tool evaluates pairs of assignment submissions to detect indications of plagiarism. However, a plagiarising student will commonly apply plagiarism-hiding modifications to source code in an attempt to evade detection. Subsequently, prior work has implied that currently available source code plagiarism detection tools are not robust to the application of pervasive plagiarism-hiding modifications. In this article, 11 source code plagiarism detection tools are evaluated for robustness against plagiarism-hiding modifications. The tools are evaluated with data sets of simulated undergraduate plagiarism, constructed with source code modifications representative of undergraduate students. The results of the performed evaluations indicate that currently available source code plagiarism detection tools are not robust against modifications which apply fine-grained transformations to the source code structure. Of the evaluated tools, JPlag and Plaggie demonstrates the greatest robustness to different types of plagiarism-hiding modifications. However, the results also indicate that graph-based tools, specifically those that compare programs as program dependence graphs, show potentially greater robustness to pervasive plagiarism-hiding modifications.},

As every software is confined to an order, which ensure its steadiness and empowers it to be perceptible by our eyes, and builds up “similarities to” and “contrasts from” the alternative software(s). Adding new features to the current framework is exceptionally repetitive and dreary. Additionally, doing the progressions without influencing the working of the proposed framework requires a ton of manual hours. In light of this, the domain of software transplantation assumes a significant role alongside the sub-domains, which likewise requires consideration. The authors investigated the accessible literature till year 2019, in domain confined to Software Transplantation. As only handfuls of articles were accessible relate to the domain, so the investigation was stretched out further to softwares features with context to the source code. This paper is intended for those who are working in the field of software architecture, concept traceability, bug localization; where they need an insight as well as the need to highlight the area-of-interest—software artifacts. The paper answers questions such as: (1) How to discover/identify feature(s)-of-interest? (2) What should be the selection criteria for picking feature(s)-of-interest?

  abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, a number of malicious actors have started capitalizing the topic. Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware, the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed Android malware. We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains 4,322 COVID-19 themed apk samples (2,500 unique apps) and 611 potential malware samples (370 unique malicious apps) by the time of mid-November, 2020. We then present an analysis of them from multiple perspectives including trends and statistics, installation methods, malicious behaviors and malicious actors behind them. We observe that the COVID-19 themed apps as well as malicious ones began to flourish almost as soon as the pandemic broke out worldwide. Most malicious apps are camouflaged as benign apps using the same app identifiers (e.g., app name, package name and app icon). Their main purposes are either stealing users’ private information or making profit by using tricks like phishing and extortion. Furthermore, only a quarter of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers who have been active for a long time, while 75\% of them are newcomers in this pandemic. The malicious developers are mainly located in the US, mostly targeting countries including English-speaking countries, China, Arabic countries and Europe. To facilitate future research, we have publicly released all the well-labelled COVID-19 themed apps (and malware) to the research community. Till now, over 30 research institutes around the world have requested our dataset for COVID-19 themed research.},

  abstract = {Over the years, software applications have captured a big market ranging from smart devices (smartphones, smart wearable devices) to enterprise resource management including Enterprise Resource Planning, office applications, and the entertainment industry (video games and graphics design applications). Protecting the copyright of software applications and protection from malicious software (malware) have been topics of utmost interest for academia and industry for many years. The standard solutions use the software license key or rely on the Operating System (OS) protection mechanisms, such as Google Play Protect. However, some end users have broken these protections to bypass payments for applications that are not free. They have done so by downloading the software from an unauthorised website or by jailbreaking the OS protection mechanisms. As a result, they cannot determine whether the software they download is malicious or not. Further, if the software is uploaded to a third party platform by malicious users, the software developer has no way of knowing about it. In such cases, the authenticity or integrity of the software cannot be guaranteed. There is also a problem of information transparency among software platforms. In this study, we propose an architecture that is based on blockchain technology for providing data transparency, release traceability, and auditability. Our goal is to provide an open framework to allow users, software vendors, and security practitioners to monitor misbehaviour and assess software vulnerabilities for preventing malicious software downloads. Specifically, the proposed solution makes it possible to identify software developers who have gone rogue and are potentially developing malicious software. Furthermore, we introduce an incentive policy for encouraging security engineers, victims and software owners to participate in collaborative works. The outcomes will ensure the wide adoption of a software auditing ecosystem in software markets, specifically for some mobile device manufacturers that have been banned from using the open-source OS such as Android. Consequently, there is a demand for them to verify the application security without completely relying on the OS-specific security mechanisms.},

Ideally, artifacts, including tools, benchmarks, and data, support the dissemination of ideas, provide evidence for research claims, and serve as a starting point for future research.

To help the software engineering community realize the full potential of artifacts, we seek to understand the challenges involved in the creation, sharing, and use of artifacts. To that end, we perform a mixed-methods study including a survey of artifacts in software engineering publications, and an online survey of 153 software engineering researchers. By analyzing the perspectives of artifact creators, users, and reviewers, we identify several high-level challenges that affect the quality of artifacts including mismatched expectations between these groups, and a lack of sufficient reward for both creators and reviewers. Using Diffusion of Innovations (DoI) as an analytical framework, we examine how these challenges relate to one another, and build an understanding of the factors that affect the sharing and success of artifacts. Finally, we make recommendations to improve the quality of artifacts based on our results and existing best practices.},

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, app developers have joined the response effort in various ways by releasing apps that target different user bases (e.g., all citizens or journalists), offer different services (e.g., location tracking or diagnostic-aid), provide generic or specialized information, etc. While many apps have raised some concerns by spreading misinformation or even malware, the literature does not yet provide a clear landscape of the different apps that were developed. In this study, we focus on the Android ecosystem and investigate Covid-related Android apps. In a best-effort scenario, we attempt to systematically identify all relevant apps and study their characteristics with the objective to provide a first taxonomy of Covid-related apps, broadening the relevance beyond the implementation of contact tracing. Overall, our study yields a number of empirical insights that contribute to enlarge the knowledge on Covid-related apps: (1) Developer communities contributed rapidly to the COVID-19, with dedicated apps released as early as January 2020; (2) Covid-related apps deliver digital tools to users (e.g., health diaries), serve to broadcast information to users (e.g., spread statistics), and collect data from users (e.g., for tracing); (3) Covid-related apps are less complex than standard apps; (4) they generally do not seem to leak sensitive data; (5) in the majority of cases, Covid-related apps are released by entities with past experience on the market, mostly official government entities or public health organizations.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, malware applications are dangerous threats to Android devices, users, developers, and application stores. Researchers are trying to discover new methods for malware detection because the complexity of malwares, their continuous changes, and damages caused by their attacks have increased. One of the most important challenges in detecting malware is to have a balanced dataset. In this paper, a detection method is proposed to identify malware to improve accuracy and reduce error rates by preprocessing the used dataset and balancing it. To attain these purposes, the static analysis is used to extract features of the applications. The ranking methods of features are used to preprocess the feature set and the low-effective features are removed. The proposed method also balances the dataset by using the techniques of undersampling, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and a combination of both methods, which have not yet been studied among detection methods. Then, the classifiers of K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine, and Iterative Dichotomiser 3 are used to create the detection model. The performance of KNN with SMOTE is better than the performance of the other classifiers. The obtained results indicate that the criteria of precision, recall, accuracy, F-measure, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient are over 97\%. The proposed method is effective in detecting 99.49\% of the malware’s existing in the used dataset and new malware.},

  abstract = {The popularity of Android brings much functionality to its users but it also brings many threats. Repacked Android application is one such threat which is the root of many other threats such as malware, phishing, adware, and economical loss. Earlier many techniques have been proposed for the detection of repacked application but they have their limitations and bottlenecks. The issue of malware and duplicate apps affecting the smartphones are being reported on a large scale and has drawn the attention of many researchers. Major of these issues target Android-based phones. Repackaged apps are usually infected versions of popular apps. Adversaries download a popular Android app, and obtain the code using reverse engineering and then add their code (often malicious) to it and repackage and release the app. The existing methods focus primarily on the extraction of apps’ behavior and comparing the same with their static code. These have the least chance of detecting the code obfuscation and the dynamic behavior of apps. Therefore, a framework of App-NTS is proposed which extracts the dynamic behavior of the apps from the network traffic analysis. The dynamic vantage point algorithm used for the comparative analysis of the apps’ behavior, which significantly helps in reducing the time complexity. Experimental analysis has detected 365 repacked apps from 8645 apps that are downloaded from various online markets and have also brought dramatic results in terms of better performance with Mean Square Error value decreased by 41\% and Log loss reduced by 35.2\%. There is an increase in accuracy of 18.3\% when compared to other states of the art techniques.},

  abstract = {The paper approaches the task of handwritten text recognition (HTR) with attentional encoder–decoder networks trained on sequences of characters, rather than words. We experiment on lines of text from popular handwriting datasets and compare different activation functions for the attention mechanism used for aligning image pixels and target characters. We find that softmax attention focuses heavily on individual characters, while sigmoid attention focuses on multiple characters at each step of the decoding. When the sequence alignment is one-to-one, softmax attention is able to learn a more precise alignment at each step of the decoding, whereas the alignment generated by sigmoid attention is much less precise. When a linear function is used to obtain attention weights, the model predicts a character by looking at the entire sequence of characters and performs poorly because it lacks a precise alignment between the source and target. Future research may explore HTR in natural scene images, since the model is capable of transcribing handwritten text without the need for producing segmentations or bounding boxes of text in images.},

  abstract = {With the recognition of free apps, Android has become the most widely used smartphone operating system these days and it naturally invited cyber-criminals to build malware-infected apps that can steal vital information from these devices. The most critical problem is to detect malware-infected apps and keep them out of Google play store. The vulnerability lies in the underlying permission model of Android apps. Consequently, it has become the responsibility of the app developers to precisely specify the permissions which are going to be demanded by the apps during their installation and execution time. In this study, we examine the permission-induced risk which begins by giving unnecessary permissions to these Android apps. The experimental work done in this research paper includes the development of an effective malware detection system which helps to determine and investigate the detective influence of numerous well-known and broadly used set of features for malware detection. To select best features from our collected features data set we implement ten distinct feature selection approaches. Further, we developed the malware detection model by utilizing LSSVM (Least Square Support Vector Machine) learning approach connected through three distinct kernel functions i.e., linear, radial basis and polynomial. Experiments were performed by using 2,00,000 distinct Android apps. Empirical result reveals that the model build by utilizing LSSVM with RBF (i.e., radial basis kernel function) named as FSdroid is able to detect 98.8\% of malware when compared to distinct anti-virus scanners and also achieved 3\% higher detection rate when compared to different frameworks or approaches proposed in the literature.},

  abstract = {Android has been the most popular smartphone system with multiple platform versions active in the market. To manage the application’s compatibility with one or more platform versions, Android allows apps to declare the supported platform SDK versions in their manifest files. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of this modern software mechanism. Our objective is to measure the current practice of declared SDK versions (which we term as DSDK versions afterwards) in real apps, and the (in)consistency between DSDK versions and their host apps’ API calls. To successfully analyze a modern dataset of 22,687 popular apps (with an average app size of 25MB), we design a scalable approach that operates on the Android bytecode level and employs a lightweight bytecode search for app analysis. This approach achieves a good performance suitable for online vetting in app markets, requiring only around 5 seconds to process an app on average. Besides shedding light on the characteristics of DSDK in the wild, our study quantitatively measures two side effects of inappropriate DSDK versions: (i) around 35\% apps under-set the minimum DSDK versions and could incur runtime crashes, but fortunately, only 11.3\% apps could crash on Android 6.0 and above; (ii) around 2\% apps, due to under-claiming the targeted DSDK versions, are potentially exploitable by remote code execution, and half of them invoke the vulnerable API via embedded third-party libraries. These results indicate the importance and difficulty of declaring correct DSDK , and our work can help developers fulfill this goal.},

It is also being promoted as a communication tool for use in such situations by its developers and others. In this work, we report on a security analysis of Bridgefy. Our results show that Bridgefy, as analysed, permitted its users to be tracked, offered no authenticity, no effective confidentiality protections and lacked resilience against adversarially crafted messages. We verified these vulnerabilities by demonstrating a series of practical attacks on Bridgefy. Thus, if protesters relied on Bridgefy, an adversary could produce social graphs about them, read their messages, impersonate anyone to anyone and shut down the entire network with a single maliciously crafted message.},

  abstract = {A smart contract is a program that resides its binary code and states in blockchain to provide contract-like functionality. The binary code is unchangeable once it is deployed into the chain. This can ensure the underlying blockchain to be an append-only decentralized and secure database, but it may also bring potential threats. For example, Selfdestruct is a typical command used to disable a smart contract and clean all relevant information. It is believed that if an address of a deactivated contract is inaccessible, it is impossible for an attacker to explore. However, in this work, we identify that instead of erasing or overwriting the previously recorded data, the smart contract’s running environment may store its latest data and states in the latest block even after using Selfdestruct. Motivated by this observation, we show how these remained traces can reveal private information, i.e., how a privatized function can be externally accessed, and discuss how to attack the contract without knowing its application binary interface (ABI). In the end, we also discuss some potential solutions to protect information leakage in such scenario.},

  abstract = {Modern consumer devices present major challenges in digital forensic investigations due to security mechanisms that protect user data. The entire physical attack surface of a seized device such as a mobile phone must be considered in an effort to acquire data of forensic value. Several USB protocols have been introduced in recent years, including Power Delivery, which enables negotiations of power delivery to or from attached devices. A key feature is that the protocol is handled by dedicated hardware that is beyond the control of the device operating systems. This self-contained design is a security liability with its own attack surface and undocumented trust relationships with other peripherals and the main system-on-chips. This chapter presents a methodology for vulnerability discovery in USB Power Delivery implementations for Apple devices. The protocol and Apple-specific communications are reverse engineered, along with the firmware of the dedicated USB Power Delivery hardware. The investigation of the attack surface and potential security vulnerabilities can facilitate data acquisition in digital forensic investigations.},

  abstract = {Software engineers regularly use JavaScript and Python for both front-end and back-end automation tasks. On top of JavaScript and Python, there are several frameworks to facilitate automation tasks further. Some of these frameworks are Node Manager Package (npm) and Python Package Index (PyPi), which are open source (OS) package libraries. The public registries npm and PyPi use to host packages allow any user with a verified email to publish code. The lack of a comprehensive scanning tool when publishing to the registry creates security concerns. Users can report malicious code on the registry; however, attackers can still cause damage until they remove their tool from the platform. Furthermore, several packages depend on each other, making them more vulnerable to a bad package in the dependency tree. The heavy code reuse creates security artifacts developers have to consider, such as the package reach. This project will illustrate a high-level overview of common risks associated with OS registries and the package dependency structure. There are several attack types, such as typosquatting and combosquatting, in the OS package registries. Outdated packages pose a security risk, and we will examine the extent of technical lag present in the npm environment. In this paper, our main contribution consists of a survey of common threats in OS registries. Afterward, we will offer countermeasures to mitigate the risks presented. These remedies will heavily focus on the applications of Machine Learning (ML) to detect suspicious activities. To the best of our knowledge, the ML-focused countermeasures are the first proposed possible solutions to the security problems listed. In addition, this project is the first survey of threats in npm and PyPi, although several studies focus on a subset of threats.},

Such leaks severely affect the security of end-users and the merchants associated with the apps, resulting in privacy violations and actual financial loss. In this paper, we study the payment credential leaks for four top-tiered Cashiers that serve over one billion users and tens of millions of merchants globally. Through studying practical mobile payment systems, we identify new leaking sources of payment credentials and find 4 types of exploits with severe consequences, which are caused by the credential leaks and additional implementation flaws.

Despite its prevalence and critical nature, no existing standard can guide the secure deployment of mobile payment. Thus, the protocol designs and implementations from different Cashiers are diverse. Given the complicated multi-party interactions in mobile payment, either the Cashiers or the apps may not fully consider various threat models, which enlarges the attack surface and causes the exploits with severe consequences, ranging from financial loss to privacy violations. In this paper, we perform an in-depth security analysis of real-world third-party payment services for mobile apps. Specifically, we examine the mobile payment systems from five top-tier Cashiers that serve over one billion users globally. Leveraging insecure protocol designs and practical implementation flaws, e.g. , vulnerable backend SDKs for mobile apps, we have discovered six types of exploits. These exploits enable the attacker to violate user privacy and shop for free in the victim apps, affecting millions of users. Finally, we propose the fixings to defend against these exploits.

Enhanced by FET techniques, automated testing tools can generate targeted test cases. We demonstrate Leif, a trace-driven fuzzing tool, as a proof-of-concept implementation of FET techniques. Experiment results on 27 commercial services show that FET inference precisely captures documented parameter definitions, which helps Leif to discover 11 new bugs and reduce \$\$72\\\% \\sim 86\\\%\$\$ 72 \% ∼ 86 \% fuzzing time as compared to state-of-the-art fuzzers.},

As a result, the number of new/modified malware samples is rapidly increasing. The malware generated in this way attacks vulnerabilities, such as PCs and mobile devices without security patch, causing damages involving malicious actions, such as personal information leakage, theft of authorized certificates, and cryptocurrency mining. To solve this problem, most security companies use the signature-based malware detection technique to detect malware, in which the signatures of known malware and files suspected to be malware are compared before detecting malware. However, the signature-based malware detection technique has a limitation in that it is not efficient for detecting new/modified malware which is generated rapidly. Recently, research is underway to utilize deep learning technology for detecting new/modified malware. In this study, we propose a SAT scheme that can detect not only known malware but also new/modified malware more quickly and accurately, thereby reducing malware-induced damages to PCs and mobile devices.

Specifically, we generate strokes directly from the speech by Speech2Stroke. The performance of Speech2Stroke is evaluated by the specific stroke error rate(SER). The SER of the optimal model can achieve 20.61\%. Through the experiments and analysis, we show that our model has the ability to capture the alignment between audio and the internal structures of pictographic characters.},

  abstract = {Mobile malware poses undoubtedly a major threat to the continuously increasing number of mobile users worldwide. While researchers have been trying vigorously to find optimal detection solutions, mobile malware is becoming more sophisticated and its writers are getting more and more skilled in hiding malicious code. In this paper, we examine the usefulness of two known dimensionality reduction transformations namely, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) in malware detection. Starting from a large set of base prominent classifiers, we study how they can be combined to build an accurate ensemble. We propose a simple ensemble aggregated base model of similar feature type as well as a complex ensemble that can use multiple and possibly heterogeneous base models. The experimental results in contemporary Androzoo benchmark corpora verify the suitability of ensembles for this task and clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

  abstract = {Since Google unveiled Android OS for smartphones, malware are thriving with 3Vs, i.e. volume, velocity and variety. A recent report indicates that one out of every five business/industry mobile application leaks sensitive personal data. Traditional signature/heuristic based malware detection systems are unable to cope up with current malware challenges and thus threaten the Android ecosystem. Therefore recently researchers have started exploring machine learning and deep learning based malware detection systems. In this paper, we performed a comprehensive feature analysis to identify the significant Android permissions and propose an efficient Android malware detection system using machine learning and deep neural network. We constructed a set of 16 permissions ( \\(8\\\%\\) of the total set) derived from variance threshold, auto-encoders, and principal component analysis to build a malware detection engine which consumes less train and test time without significant compromise on the model accuracy. Our experimental results show that the Android malware detection model based on the random forest classifier is most balanced and achieves the highest area under curve score of \\(97.7\\\%\\) , which is better than the current state-of-art systems. We also observed that deep neural networks attain comparable accuracy to the baseline results but with a massive computational penalty.},

Furthermore, most of the existing mobile applications in digital stores are Android-based applications. Security in these kinds of applications is an issue that must be addressed because they handle sensitive personal information exposed to be exploited or misused by malicious agents. In this context, we have performed a complete security penetration testing on several Android applications following the most common risks according to OWASP mobile 2016 and using different tools such as Drozer, Dex2jar, Android Debug Bridge, among others. We describe the vulnerability, type of attack, application analyzed, and external tools used for each scenario. Once the vulnerabilities are exposed, we show a summary of the performed attacks, a risk analysis, and provide security recommendations for each layout. This work’s novelty is the provisioning of a risk matrix that resumes each attack’s main points and the whole vulnerability analysis in mobile devices, as it does not exist on the official site of OWASP.},

  abstract = {The rising cyber threat puts organizations and ordinary users at risk of data breaches. In many cases, Early detection can hinder the occurrence of these incidents or even prevent a full compromise of all internal systems. The existing security controls such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems are constantly blocking numerous intrusions attempts that happen on a daily basis. However, new situations may arise where these security controls are not sufficient to provide full protection. There is a necessity to establish a threat hunting methodology that can assist investigators and members of the incident response team to analyse malicious binaries quickly and efficiently. The methodology proposed in this research is able to distinguish malicious binaries from benign binaries using a quick and efficient way. The proposed methodology consists of static and dynamic hunting techniques. Using these hunting techniques, the proposed methodology is not only capable of identifying a range of signature-based anomalies but also to pinpoint behavioural anomalies that arise in the operating system when malicious binaries are triggered. Static hunting can describe any extracted artifacts as malicious depending on a set of pre-defined patterns of malicious software. Dynamic hunting can assist investigators in finding behavioural anomalies. This work focuses on applying the proposed threat hunting methodology on samples of malicious binaries, which can be found in common malware repositories and presenting the results.},

  abstract = {With the development of mobile edge computing, more and more services are moved to the edge of the network, and devices there are usually with low computational abilities and little storage resources. To make it lightweight and elastic, containers can be adopted in the edge environment when migrating a certain application. With the host OS kernel shared, applications can be deployed with the least computational resources they need, making it possible to deploy more of them on relatively low-end devices. Migration is also used in scenarios like maintenance or load balance, etc. We noticed that in edge environment, devices and servers are usually built with heterogeneous Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs) processors. X86 processors are widely used in desktop PCs, laptops and servers while smart-phones are built with an ARM processor, which leads to a serious problem that a container cannot be migrated to a heterogeneous machine to continue running directly. In this paper, we firstly give an overview of heterogeneous-ISA migration, and its applications and techniques. Then we discuss the existing heterogeneous execution solution from the perspective of applicable scenarios, latency, power consumption, requirements for computational resources, etc. Next, a comparison study is given on each of the characteristics to depict the details and differences in existing works. At last, challenges and open research issues which are waiting for further studies on container migration are listed.},

This task is also known as reverse engineering and plays a pivotal role in software engineering, computer security, but also most recently in interpretability. In contrast to prior work, we do not rely on privileged information on the black box, but rather investigate the problem under a weaker assumption of having only access to inputs and outputs of the program. We approach this problem by iteratively refining a candidate set using a generative neural program synthesis approach until we arrive at a functionally equivalent program. We assess the performance of our approach on the Karel dataset. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on this challenge by finding an approximately functional equivalent program in 78\% of cases – even exceeding prior work that had privileged information on the black-box.},

While this information can be effectively derived by compiler-level approaches much of this information may be lost during the compilation process and become unavailable to binary-level tools. In this work we conduct the first detailed study on how accurately can this information be extracted or reconstructed by current state-of-the-art static reverse engineering (RE) platforms for binaries compiled with and without debug symbol information. Furthermore, it is also unclear how the imprecision in array bounds and instruction owner information that is obtained by the RE tools impacts the ability of techniques to detect illegal memory accesses at run-time. We study this issue by designing, building, and deploying a novel binary-level technique to assess the properties and effectiveness of the information provided by the static RE algorithms in the first stage to guide the run-time instrumentation to detect illegal memory accesses in the decoupled second stage. Our work explores the limitations and challenges for static binary analysis tools to develop accurate binary-level techniques to detect memory errors.},

Recent advancements in technology demonstrate the possibility of automated analysis of binaries by raising/lifting/translating them to an intermediate representation. This paper describes the efforts towards developing utilities for raising MIPS binaries to an intermediate representation (IR) of LLVM. Using LLVM-IR, one can leverage the existing utilities built over LLVM for performing automated analysis of lifted code. The implemented utilities extend open-source tools McSema and Remill for MIPS ISA. The paper presents the methodology of raising the MIPS binaries as a systematically arranged step by step procedure. While presenting the procedure, the text highlights the challenges faced during each of these translation steps. The results from the two test suites demonstrate that the implemented static binary translation (SBT) utilities can produce the LLVM-IR that can be analysed or recompiled back to an executable form.},

The growing market of this platform not only invites smart phone users, but it also becomes a point of interest for black hat hackers. Hackers use this technology for large number of activities by spreading the android applications in this platform which are not actually android packages rather malicious codes or malware. Therefore, these malwares must be handled in a smart way; otherwise, they lead to huge loss. Different techniques have been used for detection of android malware which consists of network traffic analysis, static analysis, and dynamic analysis. In this paper, a combined approach of static, dynamic, and intrinsic features for android malware detection using k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), random forest, decision tree, SVM, and ensemble learning techniques. The calculation uses a publicly available dataset of Androtrack. The estimation results shows that both the decision tree and random forest classifiers produced accuracy of 99\%.

Traditional malware detection techniques based on machine learning and feature matching are usually difficult to deal with this type of malware. Considering about this problem, an Android malware detection method based on app-image conversion is proposed, which maps the Android installation files to grayscale images, and employs the deep learning algorithm, CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks), for malware detection. A detection framework for Android malware is presented, which includes three parts: data set construction, app-image conversion, and deep learning detection. In the experiments, the parameters of CNN are determined through comparative analysis.

  abstract = {With the increased popularity and wide adaptation in the embedded system domain, Android has become the main target for malware writers. Due to rapid growth in the number, variants and diversity of malware, fast detection of malware on the Android platform has become a challenging task. Existing malware detection systems built around machine learning algorithms with static, dynamic, or both analysis techniques use a high dimensionality of feature set. Machine learning algorithms are often challenged by such a large number of feature sets and consume a lot of power and time for both training and detection. The model built using such a large number of features may include an irrelevant or negative feature that reduces the overall efficiency of the detection system. In this paper, we present a lightweight Android malware detection system based on machine learning techniques that use fewer static features to distinguish between malicious and benign applications. To reduce the feature dimensions, we have used the feature engineering approach, which utilizes a multilevel feature reduction and elimination process to create a detection model lightweight. Finally, we have built a machine learning-based detection system on the reduced feature set that performs better in comparison to the model build using the original feature set. The proposed detection system achieves accuracy and precision above 98\% and drastically reduces the feature set size from 3,73,458 to 105 features.},

Researching adversarial malware examples can help us find the vulnerability of malware detector and improve the defense ability of cyberspace. Considering the huge market share of android system, adversarial malware examples of android are studied in this paper. And an algorithm is proposed to find universal adversarial perturbations of malware. Such perturbation can be inserted the different malwares to generate adversarial examples. Then the effectiveness of algorithm is verified in the experiment. And three classic android malware detectors are used as targets. Experimental results show that universal adversarial perturbations for different machine learning models can be discovered via the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {As the blockchain enters the 2.0 era, the smart contract which is based on the blockchain platform has gradually entered people’s field of vision. By its transparency, non-tampering, independence from third-party arbitration, and trustlessness, it is widely applied in equity crowdfunding, games, insurance, particularly the Internet of Things. However, the attack on the TheDAO smart contract alert public awareness of the security of a smart contract. The essence of the smart contract is an electronic contract written in code. Due to reasons like lacking standard libraries for its programming language, several loopholes will inevitably appear in the code. Once they are found by attackers, the interests of the main body using smart contracts will be damaged. There are many types of vulnerabilities in smart contracts, such as reentrancy, short address attacks, and timestamp dependence. This article mainly focuses on re-entry vulnerabilities as the research object and analyzes the principle of re-entry vulnerabilities. Featuring immutable after being chained, the smart contract must be checked before it is chained to make up for the vulnerability. This paper provides a detection method based on symbolic execution to detect reentrancy vulnerabilities. We hope to strengthen people’s security awareness of smart contracts and boost the research of smart contracts in terms of security by our study of the smart contract reentrancy vulnerability in this article. Promote the research and development of smart contracts.},

  abstract = {Wireless chips and interfaces expose a substantial remote attack surface. As of today, most cellular baseband security research is performed on the Android ecosystem, leaving a huge gap on Apple devices. With iOS jailbreaks, last-generation wireless chips become fairly accessible for performance and security research. Yet, iPhones were never intended to be used as a research platform, and chips and interfaces are undocumented. One protocol to interface with such chips is Apple Remote Invocation (ARI), which interacts with the central phone component CommCenter and multiple user-space daemons, thereby posing a Remote Code Execution (RCE) attack surface. We are the first to reverse-engineer and fuzz-test the ARI interface on iOS . Our Ghidra scripts automatically generate a Wireshark dissector, called ARIstoteles , by parsing closed-source iOS libraries for this undocumented protocol. Moreover, we compare the quality of the dissector to fully-automated approaches based on static trace analysis. Finally, we fuzz the ARI interface based on our reverse-engineering results. The fuzzing results indicate that ARI does not only lack public security research but also has not been well-tested by Apple . By releasing ARIstoteles open-source, we also aim to facilitate similar research in the future.},

In order to tackle the above issues, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical detector, called Miner-Killer, to effectively and precisely classify Mining Trojans apart from the benign ones. First, Miner-Killer converts binary codes from Trojan samples to format files, assembly files and string files. Second, the static features are extracted by MSFV Extractor. Then, an ensemble learning model is trained by the extracted features and is applied to classify the unseen Mining Trojans. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly detect the Mining Trojans, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods applied to detect malware.},

  abstract = {Android malware, a group of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware, designed to cause substantial damage to data and systems or to access a network without authorization. With an inexorable shift in technology, Android has supplanted other Mobile platforms by being flexible and user-friendly to the users. As the number of Android apps continues to grow every day, the number of malwares aimed at attacking those users is also on the rise. Thus, it becomes emergent to identify and remove malicious Android applications before installation to prevent user’s loss. Several studies have already been carried out to anticipate Android malware using machine learning algorithms, while as per the literature survey conducted by this study, a significant research has not been found to be focusing especially on the genre of boosting algorithms. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to classify malicious and benign Android applications by using Boosting algorithm. To attain the research objective, four widely defined boosting models viz. AdaBoost, CatBoost, XGBoost, and GradientBoost were developed whereas, it was found that CatBoost and GradientBoost had the highest F1 score (93.9\%), followed by Adaboost (F1 score 93.5\%), and XGBoost (F1 score 93.5\%).},

In this paper, we propose an efficient malware detection model for Android devices centered on mobile payment applications. This model is based on client/server architecture to reduce the heavy computations of data on the mobile device and doing the processing remotely on the server. Our approach aims to develop an optimized algorithm based on machine learning models to extract the permissions and for better classification of the new installed applications on Android devices. The Random Forest regression algorithm with the numerical ranging from −100 (benign) to 100 (malware) gives good results and an accuracy close to 100\%.

Hence, current work aims to validate the effectiveness of one such scheme, Privacy-Preserving Endpoint Aggregation (PPEA), on real-time private data obtained from resource-constrained edge devices by measuring utility metrics for the average operation aggregate function. This paper aims to study the feasibility of implementing PPEA for periodic real-time heart rate collection from fitness trackers, which are pervasive IoT devices within the personal healthcare domain capable of recording individual's private data, by considering factors like memory consumption, execution time, and power consumption. We address challenges concerning resource limitations on edge devices regarding lacking out-of-the-box provisions for implementing randomization techniques to achieve DP on streaming data.},

For understanding the risks to the Android clients’ data, it is relevant to comprehend the distinction in the conduct of genuine and pernicious applications and study mobile malware detection. There are various methodologies for these Intrusions’ identification, for example, static investigation, dynamic investigation and hybrid investigation which have been covered in this paper along with their functionalities. The benefits and constraints of each classification of android malware detection systems are also discussed.

Based on this, combined with deep learning models, a multi-classifier for the Android malicious App families is implemented, which can classify 131 common malicious App families. Compared with the App classifier based on the gray-scale visualization method, it is verified that the classifier using the color visualization method can achieve better classification results. This paper uses three classes of Android App APK features: classes.dex file, class name collection and API call sequence as input for App visualization, and analyzes the classifier detection accuracy and detection time under each input characteristics. According to the experimental results, we found that using the API call sequence as the color visualization input feature can achieve the highest detection accuracy rate, which is 96.01\% in the ten malicious family classification and 100\% in the binary classification.},

To address message scarcity, some work is proposed for automatically generating commit messages. However, most of these approaches focus on generating summary of the changed software entities at the superficial level, without considering the intent behind the code changes (e.g., the existing approaches cannot generate such message: “fixing null pointer exception”). Considering developers often describe the intent behind the code change when writing the messages, we propose ChangeDoc, an approach to reuse existing messages in version control systems for automatical commit message generation. Our approach includes syntax, semantic, pre-syntax, and pre-semantic similarities. For a given commit without messages, it is able to discover its most similar past commit from a large commit repository, and recommend its message as the message of the given commit. Our repository contains half a million commits that were collected from SourceForge. We evaluate our approach on the commits from 10 projects. The results show that 21.5\% of the recommended messages by ChangeDoc can be directly used without modification, and 62.8\% require minor modifications. In order to evaluate the quality of the commit messages recommended by ChangeDoc, we performed two empirical studies involving a total of 40 participants (10 professional developers and 30 students). The results indicate that the recommended messages are very good approximations of the ones written by developers and often include important intent information that is not included in the messages generated by other tools.},

To monitor a host of the applications that runs on Android and IoT devices, this study employs a deep learning based feature detector for malware detection which can easily be trained and be used with different classifiers to assess an application’s behavior. The features learnt by the detector can be reused to transfer their learning to any future endeavors toward malware detection. To test the accuracy and effectiveness of the feature detector we test it in two phases: (i) first the features extracted are fed to a fully connected network (FCN) with Softmax activation and in (ii) second scheme we use recurrent layers of attentions to classify the Applications either as malicious or benign. Our findings reveal that the proposed feature detector achieves significant results with an F1-Score of 98.97\% and an accuracy of 98\%.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of converting a flat CMOS circuit of transistors in the SPICE format into a hierarchical circuit of CMOS gates in the same format. This problem arises in the process of layout versus schematic (LVS) verification, as well as when reengineering integrated circuits. A method for recognizing subcircuits (CMOS gates) is described. The method is implemented as a C++ program; it recognizes subcircuits that are described by the same logic functions but are not isomorphic at the transistor level as different ones. This provides the isomorphism of the original and decompiled circuits.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Integer-Overflow-to-Buffer-Overflow (IO2BO) vulnerability has been widely exploited by attackers to cause severe damages to computer systems. Automatically identifying this kind of vulnerability is critical for software security. Despite many works have been done to mitigate integer overflow, existing tools either report large number of false positives or introduce unacceptable time consumption. To address this problem, in this article we present a static analysis framework. It first constructs an inter-procedural call graph and utilizes taint analysis to accurately identify potential IO2BO vulnerabilities. Then it uses a light-weight method to further filter out false positives. Specifically, it generates constraints representing the conditions under which a potential IO2BO vulnerability can be triggered, and feeds the constraints to SMT solver to decide their satisfiability. We have implemented a prototype system ELAID based on LLVM, and evaluated it on 228 programs of the NIST’s SAMATE Juliet test suite and 14 known IO2BO vulnerabilities in real world. The experiment results show that our system can effectively and efficiently detect all known IO2BO vulnerabilities.},

Detection of malware before being published on official or unofficial application markets is critically important due to the typical end users’ widespread security inadequacy. In this paper, a novel feature selection method is proposed along with an Android malware detection approach. The feature selection method proposed in this study makes use of permissions, API calls, and strings as features, which are statically extractable from the Android executables (APK files) and it can be used in a machine learning process with different algorithms to detect malware on the Android platform. A novel document frequencybased approach, namely Delta IDF, was designed and implemented for feature selection. Delta IDF was tested upon three universal benchmark datasets that contain Android malware samples and highly promising results were obtained by using several binary classification algorithms.},

To this end, five grayscale image datasets each of which contains 4850 samples have been constructed based on different files from the contents of the Android malware samples sources. Two types of image-based features have been extracted and used to train six machine learning classifiers including Random Forest, K-nearest neighbour, Decision trees, Bagging, AdaBoost and Gradient Boost classifiers. The first type of the extracted features is local features including Scale-Invariant Feature Transform, Speeded Up Robust Features, Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) and KAZE features. The second type of the extracted features is global features including Colour Histogram, Hu Moments and Haralick Texture. Furthermore, a hybridized ensemble voting classifier has been proposed to test the efficiency of using a number of machine learning classifiers trained using local and global features as voters to make a decision in an ensemble voting classifier. Moreover, two well-known deep learning model, i.e. Residual Neural Network and Inception-v3 have been tested using some of the constructed image datasets. Furthermore, when the results of the proposed model have been compared with the results of some state-of-art works it has been revealed that the proposed model outperforms the compared previous models in term of classification accuracy, computational time, generality and classification mode.},

In this paper, we focus on three vulnerabilities of smart contract: has\_short\_address , has\_flows and is\_greedy . For the three kinds of vulnerabilities, we propose slicing matrix, a new method to extract vulnerability feature, and construct three vulnerability detection models for comparison. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy based on neural network and slice matrix is better than that based on neural network and opcode features. In other words, slice matrix can improve the accuracy of vulnerable contract detection. Among our three detection models, the model based on random forest and opcode features performs best.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the buildings where we spend most part of our life are rapidly evolving. They are becoming fully automated environments where energy consumption, access control, heating and many other subsystems are all integrated within a single system commonly referred to as smart building (SB). To support the growing complexity of building operations, building automation systems (BAS) powering SBs are integrating consumer range Internet of things (IoT) devices such as IP cameras alongside with operational technology (OT) controllers and actuators. However, these changes pose important cybersecurity concerns since the attack surface is larger, attack vectors are increasing and attacks can potentially harm building occupants. In this paper, we analyze the threat landscape of BASs by focusing on subsystems which are strongly affected by the advent of IoT devices such as video surveillance systems and smart lightining. We demonstrate how BAS operation can be disrupted by simple attacks to widely used network protocols. Furthermore, using both known and 0-day vulnerabilities reported in the paper and previously disclosed, we present the first (at our knowledge) BAS-specific malware which is able to persist within the BAS network by leveraging both OT and IoT devices connected to the BAS. Our research highlights how BAS networks can be considered as critical as industrial control systems and security concerns in BASs deserve more attention from both industrial and scientific communities. Even within a simulated environment, our proof-of-concept attacks were carried out with relative ease and a limited amount of budget and resources. Therefore, we believe that well-funded attack groups will increasingly shift their focus towards BASs with the potential of impacting the live of thousands of people.},

The feasibility of our approach is evaluated qualitatively with 25 security-critical Android applications from Google Play with almost 7 million lines of code. We currently support 17 security pattern variants with about 199 correctly detected pattern instances in the apps. We also define a benchmark of non-trivial, security-critical Android apps, which can also be used for other security analysis tasks based on the static analysis framework Soot. With this benchmark, our analysis yields a precision of 99\% and a recall of 80\%. Finally, we discussed our approach and the developed tool with six software security experts from the SAFECode organization to obtain additional feedback.},

Accordingly, the user installs and uses a fake app that appears to be functioning normally. In this case, the user is easily exposed to attacks such as leakage of personal information.

  abstract = {Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in industrial control systems (ICS) are vulnerable to remote control logic injection attacks. Attackers target the control logic of a PLC to manipulate the behavior of a physical process such as nuclear plants, power grids, and gas pipelines. Control logic attacks have been studied extensively in the literature, including hiding the transfer of a control logic over the network from both packet header-based signatures, and deep packet inspection. For instance, these attacks transfer a control logic code as data, into small fragments (one-byte per packet), that are further padded with noise data. To detect control logic in ICS network traffic, this paper presents Shade , a novel shadow memory technique that observes the network traffic to maintain a local copy of the current state of a PLC memory. To analyze the memory contents, Shade employs a classification algorithm with 42 unique features categorized into five types at different semantic levels of a control logic code, such as number of rungs, number of consecutive decompiled instructions, and n-grams. We then evaluate Shade against control logic injection attacks on two PLCs, Modicon M221 and MicroLogix 1400 from two ICS vendors, Schneider electric and Allen-Bradley, respectively. The evaluation results show that Shade can detect an attack instance (i.e., identifying at least one attack packet during the transfer of a malicious control logic) accurately without any false alarms.},

Similo is designed to investigate denial of engineering operations (DEO) attacks, recently demonstrated to hide malicious control logic in a programmable logic controller (PLC) at field sites from an engineering software (at control center). The network traffic (if captured) contains substantial evidence to investigate DEO attacks including manipulation of control logic. Laddis , a state-of-the-art forensic approach for DEO attacks, is a binary-logic decompiler for the Allen-Bradley’s RSLogix engineering software and MicroLogix 1400 PLC. It is developed with extensive manual reverse engineering effort of the underlying proprietary network protocol and the binary control logic. Unfortunately, Laddis is not scalable and requires similar efforts to extend on other engineering software/PLCs. The proposed solution, Similo , is based on the observation that engineering software of different vendors are equipped with decompilers. Similo is a virtual-PLC framework that integrates the decompilers with their respective (previously-captured) ICS network traffic of control logic. It recovers the binary logic into a high-level source code (of the programming languages defined by IEC 61131-3 standard) automatically. Similo can work with both proprietary/open protocols without requiring protocol specifications and the binary formats of control logic. Thus, it is scalable to different ICS vendors. We evaluate Similo on three PLCs of two ICS vendors, i.e. MicroLogix 1400, MicroLogix 1100, and Modicon M221. These PLCs support proprietary protocols and the control logics written in two programming languages: Ladder Logic and Instruction List. The evaluation results show that Similo can accurately reconstruct a control logic from an ICS network traffic and can be used to investigate the DEO attacks effectively.},

  abstract = {Abstract Software obfuscation has been developed for over 30 years. A problem always confusing the communities is what security strength the technique can achieve. Nowadays, this problem becomes even harder as the software economy becomes more diversified. Inspired by the classic idea of layered security for risk management, we propose layered obfuscation as a promising way to realize reliable software obfuscation. Our concept is based on the fact that real-world software is usually complicated. Merely applying one or several obfuscation approaches in an ad-hoc way cannot achieve good obscurity. Layered obfuscation, on the other hand, aims to mitigate the risks of reverse software engineering by integrating different obfuscation techniques as a whole solution. In the paper, we conduct a systematic review of existing obfuscation techniques based on the idea of layered obfuscation and develop a novel taxonomy of obfuscation techniques. Following our taxonomy hierarchy, the obfuscation strategies under different branches are orthogonal to each other. In this way, it can assist developers in choosing obfuscation techniques and designing layered obfuscation solutions based on their specific requirements.},

First, a structural approach in which gate structures are recognized as channel connected sequences of transistors is used. Then channel connected sequences of transistors which implement CMOS gates are searched for.

Recently, several deep learning models have been employed to detect a cyber threat such as network attack, malware infiltration, or phishing website; nevertheless, they suffer from not being explainable to security experts. Security experts not only do need to detect the incoming threat but also need to know the incorporating features that cause that particular security incident. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a deep embedded neural network expert system (DeNNeS) that extracts refined rules from a trained deep neural network (DNN) architecture to substitute the knowledge base of an expert system. The knowledge base later is used to classify an unseen security incident and inform the final user of the corresponding rule that made that inference. We consider different rule extraction scenarios, and to prove the robustness of DeNNeS, we evaluate it on two cybersecurity datasets including UCI phishing websites dataset and Android malware dataset comprising more than 4000 Android APKs from several sources. The comparison results of DeNNeS with standalone DNN, JRip, and common machine learning algorithms show that DeNNeS with the retraining uncovered samples scenario outperforms other algorithms on both datasets. Furthermore, the extracted rules approximately reproduce the accuracy of the neural network from which they are derived. DeNNeS achieves an outstanding accuracy of \\(97.5\\\%\\) and a negligible false positive rate of \\(1.8\\\%\\) about \\(2.4\\\%\\) higher and \\(3.5\\\%\\) lower than the rule learner JRip on the phishing dataset. Moreover, DeNNeS outperforms random forest (RF), which produces the highest results among decision tree (DT), support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, and Gaussian naive Bayes. Despite smaller training data in the malware dataset, DeNNeS achieves an accuracy of \\(95.8\\\%\\) and \\(\{F\_\{1\}\\,score\}\\) of \\(91.1\\\%\\) , much higher than JRip and RF.},

  abstract = {Ethereum is a blockchain platform that supports smart contracts. Smart contracts are pieces of code that perform general-purpose computations. For instance, smart contracts have been used to implement crowdfunding initiatives that raised a total of US\$6.2 billion from January to June of 2018. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study of smart contracts. Differently from prior studies that focused on particular aspects of a subset of smart contracts, our goal is to have a broader understanding of all contracts that are currently deployed in Ethereum. In particular, we elucidate how frequently used the contracts are (activity level), what they do (category), and how complex they are (source code complexity). To conduct this study, we mined and cross-linked data from four sources: Ethereum dataset on the Google BigQuery platform, Etherscan, State of the DApps, and CoinMarketCap. Our study period runs from July 2015 (inception of Ethereum) until September 2018. With regards to activity level, we notice that it is concentrated on a very small subset of the contracts. More specifically, only 0.05\% of the smart contracts are the target of 80\% of the transactions that are sent to contracts. New solutions to cope with Ethereum’s limited scalability should take such an activity imbalance into consideration. With regards to categories, we highlight that the new and widely advertised rich programming model of smart contracts is currently being used to develop very simple applications that tend to be token-centric (e.g., ICOs, Crowdsales, etc). Finally, with regards to code complexity, we observe that the source code of high-activity verified contracts is small, with at most 211 instructions in 80\% of the cases. These contracts also commonly include at least two subcontracts and libraries in their source code. The comment ratio of these contracts is also significantly higher than that of GitHub top-starred projects written in Java, C ++ , and C \# . Hence, the source code of high-activity verified smart contracts exhibit particular complexity characteristics compared to other popular programming languages. Further studies are necessary to uncover the actual reasons behind such differences. Finally, based on our findings, we propose an open research agenda to drive and foster future studies in the area.},

  abstract = {Existing architectures used in face anti-spoofing tend to deploy registered spatial measurements to generate feature vectors for spoof detection. This means that the ordering or sequence in which specific statistics are computed cannot be changed, as one moves from one facial profile to another. While this arrangement works in a person-specific setting, it becomes a major drawback when single-sided training is done based on the natural face class alone. To mitigate subject identity linked content interference within the anti-spoofing frame, we propose a identity-independent architecture based on random correlated scans of natural face images. The same natural face image can be scanned multiple times through independent correlated random walks before deriving simple differential features on the 1D scanned vectors. This proposed frame tends to capture the pixel correlation statistics with minimal content interference and shows great promise, particularly when trained on natural face sets, using a one-class support vector machine and cross-validated on other databases. Performance measured in terms of EER for detection of spoof face is found to be \\(3.8291\\\%\\) with proposed random scan features, and \\(2.02\\\%\\) with auto-population samples for inter database.},

  abstract = {Android is currently the most widespread operating system (OS) worldwide, but also the most prone to attacks. Despite the challenges faced by Industry and Academia to improve the Android OS security, it still has several vulnerabilities. Among those, the severity of the Next-Intent Vulnerability (NIV) can be immediately grasped. Android apps are made of components, which by default are private and cannot be targeted by other apps on the same phone. However, NIV allows any app to access the private components of a different app, eventually generating a crash or stealing sensitive data. NIV occurs when there is a chain of calls among different components based on the Intent messaging model and there is no control over the reliability of the first component triggering the call. NIV was first detected in 2013, but it is still an open issue. In this paper, we present Next-Intent Vulnerability Detector ( \\(\\mathcal \{N\}\\hbox \{I\}\\mathcal \{V\}\\hbox \{D\}\\) ), a novel approach to detect NIV in Android apps by relying on type systems. \\(\\mathcal \{N\}\\hbox \{I\}\\mathcal \{V\}\\hbox \{D\}\\) applies the inference rules of its type system to the app execution paths containing a sequence of calls to three NIV-related Android APIs. Compared to the state-of-the-art, \\(\\mathcal \{N\}\\hbox \{I\}\\mathcal \{V\}\\hbox \{D\}\\) is faster and more efficient, without losing precision in detecting NIV. Finally, through \\(\\mathcal \{N\}\\hbox \{I\}\\mathcal \{V\}\\hbox \{D\}\\) Google Photos was found to be vulnerable, and we disclosed the finding on the Google official bug report website (issue number 124342801).},

  abstract = {In order to perform their goals without being detected, Malware should have a battle of wits with the analyzer. Such a way, they use a large variety of stealth methods to perform their missions. These methods allow to slow or block analysis. Most of the time, these tricks are often operating system or CPU oriented (dll injection, exception handler or API abuse). In addition, they are although focused on the most used analyst tools. These attacks, allow, among other things, to display erroneous information on the analysis tools or to silently detect it so that the malware can change its behavior in case of analysis. Depending of the degree of error of the analyzing tools used, it could become partially or totally ineffective. More than just flowed malware analysts, it is a great drawback in order to find bugs in regular software. In this article, we show how to exploits errors inside debuggers and mainly inside one of the most use: Windbg. This list of errors impacting this Microsoft’s tool mainly concerns few flaws in the disassembly engine or in the debug procedure. Some are present in the debugger from years... More directly, we show different ways to block or disturb the normal behaviour of Windbg. Thus, even if these errors are not always critical, they can negatively impact the use of software by any user. For instance, we describe a new way to know if the current process is running under the control of Windbg. This is exactly what malware author are looking for to detect analysis. Due to the complexity of architecture such as x64 and x86, it is hard to design and develop a complete disassembling tool. In fact, no disassembling tool is perfect and most of those we tested have at least one of the flaws which are shown in this article. Among the different flaws, we have int 3 misinterpretation, wrong jump interpretation, partial instruction prefix handling and unsupported instruction. Moreover, nothing prevents these tools to have other kind of errors. Thus, in order to analyze software efficiently, it is necessary to improve the analyzer tools. In this way, we offer different solution to correct the bug we encounter on the different tools.},

To solve this security issue, a comprehensive and accurate detection approach should be designed. Many research works dedicate to achieve this goal, including code analysis and machine learning methods, but these kinds of works cannot analyze large amount of Android applications comprehensively and effectively. We propose DroidDeep, which uses a Deep Belief Network model to classify Android malicious app. This proposed approach first collects 11 different kinds of static behavioral characteristics from a large amount of Android applications. Second, we design a Deep Belief Network algorithm to select unique behavioral characteristics from the collected static behavioral characteristics. Third, we detect zero-day Android malicious applications based on selected behavioral characteristics. We choose a dataset which mix with Android benign and malicious applications to evaluate the proposed method. The laboratory results show that the proposed method can obtain a higher detection accuracy (99.4\%). Moreover, the proposed approach costs 6 s in average when analyzing and detecting each Android application.},

Unfortunately, this useful set of tools can also be abused and turned into an attack vector, providing malware with the ability to interact and read content from third-party apps. In this work, we are the first to study the impact that the stealthy exploitation of Android accessibility services can have on significantly reducing the forensic footprint of malware attacks, thus hindering both live and post-incident forensic investigations. We show that through Living off the Land (LotL) tactics, or by offering a malware-only substitute for attacks typically requiring more elaborate schemes, accessibility-based malware can be rendered virtually undetectable. In the LotL approach, we demonstrate accessibility-enabled SMS and command and control (C2) capabilities. As for the latter, we show a complete cryptocurrency wallet theft, whereby the accessibility trojan can hijack the entire withdrawal process of a widely used app, including two-factor authentication (2FA). In both cases, we demonstrate how the attacks result in significantly diminished forensic evidence when compared to similar attacks not employing accessibility tools, even to the extent of maintaining device take-over without requiring malware persistence.},

  abstract = {Ethereum is the second most valuable cryptocurrency, right after Bitcoin. The most distinguishing feature of Ethereum was the introduction of smart contracts which are essentially small computer programs that sit on top of the blockchain. They are written in programming languages like Solidity and are executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Since these contracts are present on the blockchain itself, they become immutable as long as the blockchains integrity is not compromised. This makes it a nightmare for security researchers as the vulnerabilities found cannot be patched. Also, since Ethereum is a public blockchain, all the contract bytecodes are available publicly. The DAO and the Parity attack are two prominent attacks that have caused great monetary losses. There are many tools that have been developed to cope with these challenges. However, the lack of a benchmark to compare these tools, non-standard vulnerability naming conventions, etc. make the job of a security analyst very difficult. This paper provides the first ever comprehensive comparison of smart contract vulnerability discovery tools which are available in the public domain based on a comprehensive benchmark developed here. The benchmark development is based on a novel taxonomy of smart contract vulnerabilities which has been created after a thorough study of security vulnerabilities present in smart contracts.},

  abstract = {We report on measurements of the actual data transmitted to backend servers by the Singapore OpenTrace app, with a view to evaluating impacts on user privacy. We have three main findings: 1) The OpenTrace app uses Google’s Firebase service to store and manage user data. This means that there are two main parties involved in handling data transmitted from the app, namely Google and the health authority operating the OpenTrace app itself. We find that OpenTrace’s use of Firebase Analytics telemetry means the data sent by OpenTrace potentially allows the (IP-based) location of user handsets to be tracked by Google over time. We therefore recommend that OpenTrace be modified to disable use of Firebase Analytics. 2) OpenTrace also currently requires users to supply a phone number to use the app and uses the Firebase Authentication service to validate and store the entered phone number. The decision to ask for user phone numbers (or other identifiers) presumably reflects a desire for contact tracers to proactively call contacts of a person that has tested positive. Alternative designs make those contacts aware of the positive test, but leave it to the contact to initiate action. This may indicate a direct trade-off between privacy and the effectiveness of contact tracing. If storage of phone numbers is judged necessary we recommend changing OpenTrace to avoid use of Firebase Authentication for this. And finally, 3) the reversible encryption used in OpenTrace relies on a single long-term secret key stored in a Google Cloud service and so is vulnerable to disclosure of this secret key.},

  abstract = {Android smartphones have become an emerging technology due to widespread adoption. The widely used Android devices allow installation of apps and grant privileges to access confidential information from the phone which resulted in being targeted by malware developers. The dramatic rise in the number of attacks, develop an interest to make a robust system that automatically identifies the presence of malicious behavior in Android applications. The previous malware detection studies comprised of static and dynamic analysis techniques, extreme learning machine and virtual machine introspection that have few shortcomings in detection of data outflow such as high computational and performance cost, low accuracy, high false positive rates, etc. The proposed approach overcomes the problems of static and dynamic techniques in malware detection. The novel classification approach senses all kinds of source-code and application behaviors. The proposed technique scans the keywords of manifest.xml files for malicious items. By the enhancement of manifest.xml feature the proposed technique can reduce apps scan time as compared to previous proposed malware detection frameworks. This technique also improves the security of Android users.},

  abstract = {With the increasing number of Android malwares, there arises a need to develop a system that automatically detects malware in Android applications (apps). To discriminate malware applications (malapps) from benign apps, researchers have proposed several detection techniques to detect malicious apps automatically. However, most of these techniques depend on hand-crafted features which are very difficult to analyze. In this paper, the proposed Android Malware Detection approach uses MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) to discriminate malware apps from benign ones. This approach uses permissions as features based on the static analysis techniques from a disassembled APK file. Apps permission features are automatically learned by the neural network and thereby removing the need for hand-crafted features and are trained to discriminate apps. It is computationally feasible with a large number of dataset samples to perform classification. After the training, the MLP network can be executed, allowing a substantial amount of files to be detected and providing high accurate classification rate. The proposed approach is evaluated using the benchmark dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve high accuracy than that of the existing techniques.},

However, current Android obfuscation techniques primarily concentrate on Dalvik bytecode obfuscation, as Dalvik bytecode contains much semantic information, obfuscation does not hinder the attacker much. We propose a new technique named DexFus for protecting Android code based on Dalvik bytecode translation. DexFus applies obfuscation on translated C code instead of the original Dalvik code, which provides a higher level protection for applications. A prototype deployment on the Android platform demonstrates that DexFus is able to protect target applications with reasonable storage and memory overhead and high stability.},

  abstract = {Abstract Web-based cryptocurrency mining attacks, also known as cryptojacking, become increasingly popular. A large number of diverse platforms (e.g., Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS) and devices (e.g., PC, smartphones, tablets, and even critical infrastructures) are widely impacted. Although a variety of detection approaches were recently proposed, it is challenging to apply these approaches to attack prevention directly. Instead, in this paper, we present a novel generic and accurate defense solution, called “MinerGate”, against cryptojacking attacks. To achieve the goal, MinerGate is designed as an extension of network gateways or proxies to protect all devices behind it. When attacks are identified, MinerGate can enforce security rules on victim devices, such as stopping the execution of related JavaScript code and alerting victims. Compared to prior approaches, MinerGate does not require any modification of browsers or apps to collect the runtime features. Instead, MinerGate focuses on the semantics of mining payloads (usually written in WebAssembly/asm.js), and semantic-based features. In our evaluation, we first verify the correctness of MinerGate by testing MinerGate in a real environment. Then, we check MinerGate’s performance and confirm MinerGate introduces relatively low overhead. Last, we verify the accuracy of MinerGate. For this purpose, we collect the largest WebAssembly/asm.js related code with ground truth to build our experiment dataset. By comparing prior approaches and MinerGate on the dataset, we find MinerGate achieves better accuracy and coverage (i.e., 99\% accuracy and 98\% recall). Our dataset will be available online, which should be helpful for more solid understanding of cryptojacking attacks.},

We analyzed a sample of forty (40) apps developed in Burkina Faso and identified abuses of dangerous authorizations in several apps in relation to their functional needs. We also discovered combinations of dangerous permissions because it exposes the confidentiality of the data. This analysis allowed us to establish a link between permissions and vulnerabilities, as a source of risk of data security. These risks facilitate exploits of privileges that should be reduced. We have therefore proposed the need to coordinate resolution mechanisms to the administrators, developers, users to better guide the required permissions by benign apps on Android.},

Leveraging the immutability and accountability of blockchains, these event-driven programs form the basis of the new digital economy with tokens, wallets, exchanges, and markets, but facilitating also new models of peer-to-peer organizations. To judge the long-term prospects of particular projects and this new technology in general, it is important to understand how smart contracts are used. While public announcements, by their nature, make promises of what smart contracts might achieve, openly available data of blockchains provides a more balanced view on what is actually going on. We focus on Ethereum as the major platform for smart contracts and aim at a comprehensive picture of the smart contract landscape regarding common or heavily used types of contracts. To this end, we unravel the publicly available data of the main chain up to block 9 000 000, in order to obtain an understanding of almost 20 million deployed smart contracts and 1.5 billion interactions. As smart contracts act behind the scenes, their activities are only fully accessible by also considering the execution traces triggered by transactions. They serve as the basis for this analysis, in which we group contracts according to common characteristics, observe temporal aspects and characterize them quantitatively and qualitatively. We use static methods by analyzing the bytecode of contracts as well as dynamic methods by aggregating and classifying the communication between contracts.},

  abstract = {The development of theory, frameworks and tools for Explainable AI (XAI) is a very active area of research these days, and articulating any kind of coherence on a vision and challenges is itself a challenge. At least two sometimes complementary and colliding threads have emerged. The first focuses on the development of pragmatic tools for increasing the transparency of automatically learned prediction models, as for instance by deep or reinforcement learning. The second is aimed at anticipating the negative impact of opaque models with the desire to regulate or control impactful consequences of incorrect predictions, especially in sensitive areas like medicine and law. The formulation of methods to augment the construction of predictive models with domain knowledge can provide support for producing human understandable explanations for predictions. This runs in parallel with AI regulatory concerns, like the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which sets standards for the production of explanations from automated or semi-automated decision making. Despite the fact that all this research activity is the growing acknowledgement that the topic of explainability is essential, it is important to recall that it is also among the oldest fields of computer science. In fact, early AI was re-traceable, interpretable, thus understandable by and explainable to humans. The goal of this research is to articulate the big picture ideas and their role in advancing the development of XAI systems, to acknowledge their historical roots, and to emphasise the biggest challenges to moving forward.},

The stealth behaviors are not easy to be detected by existing security measures. Starting with the implementation of the instructions of the protocol programs, the normal behavior instruction sequences are captured by dynamic binary analysis. The algorithm of instruction clustering and feature distance computation is designed to mine the potential stealth attack behavior instruction sequences. The mined stealth attack behavior instruction sequences (for inline assembly) are loaded into the general executing framework. A virtual protocol behavior analysis platform HiddenDisc has been developed, and the Dynamic analysis is implemented on the platform. Then the protocol execution security evaluation scheme is proposed and implemented. Using the stealth transformation method designed by ourselves, the stealth attack behaviors are transformed. We successfully attacked the virtual target machine by using the transformed stealth attack behaviors, but the stealth behaviors were not captured. The experimental results show that the present method can accurately and efficiently perception mining unknown protocol’s stealth attack behaviors, transform and use of stealth attack behavior can also enhance our information offensive and defensive capabilities.},

This enables precise and efficient reasoning about the state of smart contracts written in Solidity.

  abstract = {There is a high demand in practical methods and tools to ensure total correctness of critical software components. A usual assumption is that the machine code (or binary code) generated by a compiler follows the semantics of the programming language. Unfortunately, modern compilers such as GCC and LLVM are too complex to be thoroughly verified, and bugs in the generated code are not uncommon. As an alternative approach, we suggest proving that the generated machine code still satisfies the functional properties expressed at the source code level. The suggested approach takes an ACSL-annotated C function along with its binary code and checks that the binary code meets the ACSL annotations. The main steps are as follows: (1) disassembling the machine code and extracting its semantics; (2) adapting the annotations to the machine level and generating the verification conditions. The implementation utilizes MicroTESK, Frama-C, Why3, and other tools. To illustrate the solution, we use the RISC-V microprocessor architecture; however, the approach is relatively independent of the target platform as it is based on formal specifications of the instruction set. It is worth noting that the presented method can be exploited as a test oracle for compiler testing.},

But, because of the low cost and good profit, Android application repackaging also developed quickly, which can make a kind of malware applications and publish them to the Android market. Therefore, in order to defend against this dangerous technology, repackaging detection technology has been continuously studied in recent years. Contrary to the repackaging detection technique, obfuscation techniques are used in the application repacking to avoid detection. This makes the effectiveness of many existing methods be affected. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on Dynamic Whole Layout Tree extraction, that we call WLTDroid, which can avoid the interference of the layout file obfuscation.

Further, using the compositional product rule and the iteration rule, we demonstrate that Bitcoin scripting is Turing complete with the limitations imposed on any real-world computer. The limitation is that there cannot be an infinite tape. Iterations can be simulated using an “unrolled” loop function with allocation to the “Alt” stack. As the product rule says, if A, B are machines, then A.B is also a machine. The iteration rule shows that if A is a machine, then (A) is also a machine. Further, the minimum power of A under which the observed square of the final configuration is blank.

  abstract = {Abstract Compiler correctness is, in its simplest form, defined as the inclusion of the set of traces of the compiled program into the set of traces of the original program, which is equivalent to the preservation of all trace properties. Here traces collect, for instance, the externally observable events of each execution. This definition requires, however, the set of traces of the source and target languages to be exactly the same, which is not the case when the languages are far apart or when observations are fine-grained. To overcome this issue, we study a generalized compiler correctness definition, which uses source and target traces drawn from potentially different sets and connected by an arbitrary relation. We set out to understand what guarantees this generalized compiler correctness definition gives us when instantiated with a non-trivial relation on traces. When this trace relation is not equality, it is no longer possible to preserve the trace properties of the source program unchanged. Instead, we provide a generic characterization of the target trace property ensured by correctly compiling a program that satisfies a given source property, and dually, of the source trace property one is required to show in order to obtain a certain target property for the compiled code. We show that this view on compiler correctness can naturally account for undefined behavior, resource exhaustion, different source and target values, side-channels, and various abstraction mismatches. Finally, we show that the same generalization also applies to many secure compilation definitions, which characterize the protection of a compiled program against linked adversarial code.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present the main concepts, components, and usage of G asol , a Gas AnalysiS and Optimization tooL for Ethereum smart contracts. G asol offers a wide variety of cost models that allow inferring the gas consumption associated to selected types of EVM instructions and/or inferring the number of times that such types of bytecode instructions are executed. Among others, we have cost models to measure only storage opcodes, to measure a selected family of gas-consumption opcodes following the Ethereum’s classification, to estimate the cost of a selected program line, etc. After choosing the desired cost model and the function of interest, G asol returns to the user an upper bound of the cost for this function. As the gas consumption is often dominated by the instructions that access the storage, G asol uses the gas analysis to detect under-optimized storage patterns, and includes an (optional) automatic optimization of the selected function. Our tool can be used within an Eclipse plugin for which displays the gas and instructions bounds and, when applicable, the gas-optimized function.},

  abstract = {Intent-Based Networking (IBN) is showing significant improvements in network management, especially by reducing the complexity through intent-level languages. However, IBN is not yet integrated and widely deployed in most networks. Network operators may still encounter several issues deploying new intents, such as reasoning about complex configurations to understand previously deployed rules before writing an intent to update the network state. Many networks include several devices distributed along with its topology, each device configured using vendor-specific languages. Thus, inferring the behavior of devices as high-level intents from low-level configurations can be an arduous and time-consuming task. Current solutions that derive high-level representations from bottom-up configuration analysis can not represent configurations in an intent-level. In this work, we present a bottom-up approach to extract intents from network configurations. To validate our approach, we develop a system called SCRIBE (SeCuRity Intent-Based Extractor), which decompiles security configurations from different network devices and translates them to an intent-level language called Nile. To demonstrate the feasibility of SCRIBE, we outline a case study and evaluate with dumps of real-world firewall configurations containing rules from various servers and institutions.},

However, testing is not enough; it is also important to ensure the quality and completeness of the tests. There are already several approaches that tackle this challenge with mutation testing, but their effectiveness is questionable since they only considered small contract samples. Hence, we evaluate the quality of smart contract mutation testing at scale. We choose the most promising of the existing (smart contract specific) mutation operators, analyse their effectiveness in terms of killability and highlight severe vulnerabilities that can be injected with the mutations. Moreover, we improve the existing mutation methods by introducing a novel killing condition that is able to detect a deviation in the gas consumption, i.e., in the monetary value that is required to perform transactions.},

Our approach does not require committing to a single inflexible compilation strategy and instead makes it straightforward to create domain-specific code translators. In addition to a small set of core definitions, our framework is a large, user-extensible collection of compilation rules each phrased to handle specific language constructs, code patterns, or data manipulations. By mixing and matching these pieces of logic, users can easily tailor extraction to their own domains and programs, getting maximum performance and ensuring correctness of the resulting assembly code. Using this approach, we complete the first proof-generating pipeline that goes automatically from high-level specifications to assembly code. In our main case study, the original specifications are phrased to resemble SQL-style queries, while the final assembly code does manual memory management, calls out to foreign data structures and functions, and is suitable to deploy on resource-constrained platforms. The pipeline runs entirely within the Coq proof assistant, leading to final, linked assembly code with overall full-functional-correctness proofs in separation logic.},

  abstract = {Android is one of the smartest and advanced operating systems in the mobile phone market in the current era. The number of smartphone users based on the Android platform is rising swiftly which increases its popularity all over the world. The rising fame of this technology attracts everyone toward it and invites more number of hackers in Android platform. These hackers spread malicious application in the market and lead to the high chance of data leakage, financial loss and other damages. Therefore, malware detection techniques should be implemented to detect the malware smartly. Different techniques have been proposed using permission-based or system call-based approaches. In this paper, a hybrid approach of static, dynamic and intrinsic features based malware detection using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and logistic regression machine learning algorithms. The intrinsic feature contribution has also been evaluated. Furthermore, linear discriminant analysis technique has been implemented to evaluate the impact on the detection rate. The calculation uses a publicly available dataset of Androtrack. Based on the estimation results, both the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and logistic regression classifiers produced accuracy of 97.5\%.},

  abstract = {People believe that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. The ability to analyze and act on data is increasingly gaining importance in this ever-expanding world. Data forms an integral part of the identity of an individual or an organization. However, as data is getting digitized and more information is being shared online via various social media platforms and apps that are specifically designed to cater to the needs of users, data privacy is becoming a matter of extreme concern. Protecting data is of paramount importance because data in the hands of nefarious individuals or organizations can pose a massive threat to both the digital and real worlds alike. Data protection is not just about protecting one’s personal data, it also includes the protection of fundamental rights and freedom of the people associated with it. Every organization is in charge of personal data associated with either the organization itself or to the clients they serve. Protecting the identity of their customers is a very huge task in itself. Illegal extraction of private and personal data by malpractices is taking place every other second and as digitally-enhanced citizens, recognizing the deliberate attempts at data phishing should be our key concern. Personal data can be used to influence and control our decisions and somewhat mould our behaviour and hence, we, as an individual, have a lot at stake when it comes to protecting confidential information. In this paper, we will discuss the various data security issues in Android devices, until the launch of Android Nougat 7.0, and how data extraction without prior information is a threat to the security, integrity, and confidentiality of the users.},

  abstract = {The rising appearance of system security threats against real-world Critical Infrastructure (CI) sites over the past years brought significant research attention into the security of Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Academic institutions and major industrial appliance vendors have since increased efforts on effective vulnerability discovery in these systems. However, from the investigation of the major recent ICS incidents, it is evident that a targeted post-exploitation chain plays a crucial role for an attack to succeed. After the initial access to the system is gained, typically through a previously unknown (zero-day) or unpatched vulnerability, weak credentials or insider assistance, a specific knowledge on the system architecture is applied to achieve stealthy and persistent presence in the system before the physical process is disrupted. In this work, we propose a set of post-exploitation and persistence techniques against WAGO PFC200 Series Programmable Logic Controller (PLC).

It was started with development of the Multitranslator package that allowed translating of the models’ source codes into required format. Then it was split into client-server tool called Distributed Storage of Models that has also models storage functions. However, we faced some problems of uncertainty due to lack of source data in translation process. It led into looking for another solution and as a result it was decided to use an expert system based on CLIPS. It was developed an interaction between Distributed Storage of Models, that contains Multitranslator, with CLIPS to automate the translation process in exceptional cases with uncertainty. To utilize CLIPS, we are not just using the expert system itself with knowledge base making user interaction with it, being integrated into the complex of translation, but also allow to edit the rules within the base for the advanced users via interface of intelligent editor. The results of the tests show possibility to reduce time costs of some types of uncertainty cases even at early stages of development. It proves to further increase functionality of the translation complex in terms of automation of models’ translation.},

Which clearly make the features chosen and build as features vector highly influence the credibility of the model in classifying with high accuracy the unknown applications. For this reason, the research field gave a decent attention to resolve this problematic in malware detection models by improving the quality of features used in classification process, and performing feature selection processes in order to reduce dimensionality of features vectors, selecting most relevant, correlated and informative features and to eliminate redundant information. Many solutions were invented for this purpose using machine-learning algorithm to evaluate performance of classification using a specific set of features or by using filter feature selection algorithms that give a rank to each feature depending on its occurrence frequency, weight or its correlation. In this paper, we proposed an approach using CNN deep learning model for classifying and detecting android malwares as a solution for feature selection and redundancy problematic.},

This poses a significant problem for white-box analysis tools, which often require that the source code of the program under test is compiled into an intermediate format, like the LLVM IR.

Moreover, after identifying software as malware, unethical developer repackages the detected one and again launches the software. Unfortunately, repackaged software remains undetected mostly. In this research three different tasks were done. Comparing to the existing work we have used source code based analysis using bag-of words algorithm in machine learning. By modifying Bag-of-word procedure and adding some additional preprocessing of dataset the evaluation results represent 0.55\% better than the existing work in this field. In that case re-packaging was included and this is a new edition in this field of research. Moreover in this research, a vocabulary was also created to identify the malicious code. Here with existing 69 malicious patterns more 12 malicious patterns were added. In addition to these two contributions, we have also implemented our model in a web application to test.

Timely and comprehensive detection of all smart Ponzi schemes is the key to constructed an automatic detection model of smart Ponzi scheme. A model that effectively detect smart Ponzi scheme in its full lifecycle is proposed in this paper. The model only uses features based on operation codes (i.e., opcodes) of smart contract on Ethereum. The systematic modeling strategy realizes the efficient automatic detection model of smart Ponzi scheme step by step. Precision, Recall and F1-score of the model are 0.98, 0.93 and 0.95 respectively by experiments. Smart Ponzi schemes hidden on Ethereum are detected effectively by the model. More importantly, the performance of model is guaranteed at any moment in the lifecycle, even at the birth of a smart Ponzi scheme.},

  abstract = {Android, the world’s most widely used mobile operating system, is the target of a large number of malwares. These malwares have brought great trouble to information security and users’ privacy, such as leaking personal information, secretly downloading programs to consume data, and secretly sending deduction SMS messages. With the increase of malwares, detection methods have been proposed constantly. Especially in recent years, the malware detection methods based on deep learning are popular. However, the detection methods based on static features have a low accuracy, and others based on dynamic features take a long time, all this limits its scope. In this paper, we proposed a static feature detection method based on deep learning. It extracts specific API calls of applications and uses DNN network for detection. With the dataset composed about 4000 applications and extremely short time, it can achieve an accuracy rate of more than 99\%.},

The field, however, has not yet arrived at a fully satisfactory solution, in the sense of avoiding restrictions on control flow (important for compiler optimization), controlling access to intermediate program points (important for modularity), and supporting total correctness. Proposals in the literature support some of these properties, but a solution that meets them all is yet to be found. We introduce the novel Hoare-style program logic \\(\\mathcal \{L\}\_A\\) , which interprets postconditions relative to program points when these are first encountered. The logic can support both partial and total correctness, derive contracts for arbitrary control flow, and allows one to freely choose decomposition strategy during verification while avoiding step-indexed approximations and global invariants. The logic can be instantiated for a variety of concrete instruction set architectures and intermediate languages. The rules of \\(\\mathcal \{L\}\_A\\) have been verified in the interactive theorem prover HOL4 and integrated with the toolbox HolBA for semi-automated program verification, making it applicable to the ARMv6 and ARMv8 instruction sets.},

  abstract = {Android with its large market attracts malware developers. Malware developers employ obfuscation techniques to bypass malware detection mechanisms. Existing systems cannot effectively detect obfuscated Android malware. In this paper, We propose a novel approach to identify obfuscated Android malware. Our proposed approach is based on the intuition that opcode sequences are more resilient to the obfuscation techniques. We first propose an effective approach based on TFIDF algorithm to identify distinctive opcode sequences. Then we represent the opcode sequences as images and reduce the problem of identifying an obfuscated malware to the problem of transforming two images to one another, i.e. unobfuscated malware representation to the obfuscated one. In order to achieve the above, we resort to the transfer learning. We implemented a prototype dubbed AOMDroid based on the proposed approach and extensively evaluated its performance of accuracy and detection time. AOMDroid outperforms four related works that we compared with, and has an accuracy rate of 92.26\% in detecting Android obfuscated malware. In addition, AOMDroid supports the detection of 21 Android malware family types. Its malware family detecion accuracy rate is 87.39\%. The average time spent by AOMDroid to detect a single Android application is 0.963 s.},

The vulnerabilities identified enable attackers to predict, reactivate and modify tickets, all of which can have damaging consequences to the operator’s business. We further reveal poor implementation of encryption mechanisms, which can lead to information leakage, as well as how adversaries could harness the operator’s infrastructure to launch Denial of Service attacks. We propose several improvements to mitigate the weaknesses identified, in particular an alternative digital ticketing system, which can serve as a blueprint for increasing the robustness of similar apps.},

Existing defense methods improve robustness at the cost of decrease in accuracy. In this paper, we propose a Heterogeneous Graph Embedding Malware Detection method, called HGEMD. It could improve both accuracy and robustness by making use of relations between apps. Specifically, we firstly extract API calls from the individual app as attribute and auxiliary information (i.e., permission, third-party library) from massive apps to construct relations. Then, we build an Attributed Heterogeneous Graph (AHG) to simultaneously model attribute and relations. Furthermore, we adopt graph convolution network and attention mechanism to fuse above heterogeneous information. Experimental results on large-scale dataset collected from Google Play demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the respect of accuracy and robustness.},

However, smart contracts written by developers create potential security vulnerabilities and can result in huge economic losses. Therein, detecting potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts plays an important role in maintaining the security of the blockchain. There are a series of schemes work on finding bugs in smart contracts, such as Oyente and ContractFuzzer, etc. However, existing solutions only address several types of security vulnerabilities on a single platform. In this paper, we propose a general framework to detect potential vulnerabilities of smart contracts. In order to abstract the execution logic of smart contracts, we need to convert them into control flow graphs. We use the Ullmann algorithm to discover vulnerabilities from these graphs. Also, we give a running example to illustrate how our framework can be used to detect the reentrancy problems written by solidity.},

  abstract = {Malware authors do their best to conceal their malicious software to increase its probability of spreading and to slow down analysis. One method used to conceal malware is packing, in which the original malware is completely hidden through compression or encryption, only to be reconstructed at run-time. In addition, packers can be metamorphic, meaning that the output of the packer will never be exactly the same, even if the same file is packed again. As the use of known off-the-shelf malware packers is declining, it is becoming increasingly more important to implement methods of detecting packed executables without having any known samples of a given packer. In this study, we evaluate the use of recurrent neural networks as a means to classify whether or not a file is packed by a metamorphic packer. We show that even with quite simple networks, it is possible to correctly distinguish packed executables from non-packed executables with an accuracy of up to \\(89.36\\\%\\) when trained on a single packer, even for samples packed by previously unseen packers. Training the network on more packer raises this number to up to \\(99.69\\\%\\) .},

To address these issues, different machine learning (ML) algorithms and models are proposed for classifying Android benign or malicious applications. Algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), SVM, and Naive Bayes (NB) can classify with high accuracy. Each model are trained on the specific data set with specific algorithms. And they play with different performance in different scenarios. Besides, if one training data set is polluted by attackers, it would be cause a high false alarm on benign apps or miss some malicious apps. In order to enhance the generality of classifications and improve the resistance on attacks to trained model, we propose a Weighted Voting Framework (WVF) for Android app’s vetting based on multiple machine learning models. Instead of classifying based on a single ML model, WVF makes the final decision through a weighted voting mechanism conducted on multiple ML models. The experimental results show that the performance of the model is improved compared to the single model before the combination.},

  abstract = {Blockchains support execution of smart contracts: programs encoding complex transactions between distrusting parties. Due to their distributed nature, blockchains rely on third-party miners to execute and validate transactions. Miners are compensated by charging users with gas based on the execution cost of the transaction. To compute the exact gas cost, blockchains track gas cost dynamically creating its own overhead. This paper presents a static exact gas-cost analysis technique that can be employed to eliminate dynamic gas tracking. This approach presents further benefits such as providing miners with a trusted gas bound that can be verified in linear time, and eliminating out-of-gas exceptions. To handle recursion and unbounded computation, we propose a novel amortization technique that stores gas inside data structures. We have implemented our analysis technique in a tool called GasBoX that takes a contract as input and infers the gas cost of its functions automatically. We have evaluated GasBoX on \\(13\\) standard smart contracts borrowed from real-world blockchain projects. Our soundness theorem proves that the gas bound inferred by GasBoX exactly matches the gas cost at runtime and no dynamic gas tracking is necessary.},

A corpus of 2000 malware and equal number of benign samples are prepared to verify the model. Finally, an experiment is designed to test the model accuracy and training time. The results show high model accuracy (about 96.4\%) and a heavy reduction in training time as compared to existing models.},

  abstract = {Recently Android based smart phones become an attractive gadget for malevolent attacks. Executing malicious payload in the background without a user’s consent exercises huge amount of battery power and also causes immense heat. As a result, the life time of the battery culverts greatly. In this paper, we presented a behavior-based monitoring mechanism to monitor the Intent and API calls being used by an android application. The battery consumption of the application has been monitored before and after its installation. If deviation occurs, it’s used permissions and API calls exercised are checked and alert message will be raised to warn the user. The experimental results confirm that the tasks being executed is directly affect its battery power usage our mechanism can accurately detect and terminate malicious applications.},

  abstract = {Blockchain is deeply integrated into the vertical industry, and gradually forms an application ecosphere of blockchain in various industries. However, the security incidents of blockchain occur frequently, and especially smart contracts have become the badly-disastered area. So avoiding security incidents caused by smart contracts has become an essential topic for blockchain developing. Up to now, there is not generic method for the security auditing of smart contracts and most researchers have to use existing vulnerability detection technology. To reduce the high false rate of smart contract vulnerability detection, we use ReJection, a detection method based on abstract syntax tree (AST), to focus on the reentrancy vulnerability with obvious harm and features in smart contracts. ReJection consists of four steps. Firstly, ReJection obtains the AST corresponding to the contract by the smart contract compiler solc . Then, AST is preprocessed to eliminate redundant information. Thirdly, ReJection traverses the nodes of the AST and records the notations related to reentrancy vulnerabilities during the traversal, such as Danger-Transfer function, Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and mutex mechanism. Finally, ReJection uses record information and predefined rules to determine whether the reentrancy vulnerability is occurred. ReJection is implemented based on Slither, which is an open-source smart contract vulnerability detection tool. Furthermore, we also use the open-source smart contract code as the test program to compare experimental results to verify the effects with the ReJection and Slither. The result highlights that the ReJection has higher detection accuracy for reentrancy vulnerability.},

  abstract = {Due to the widespread use of Android devices and apps, it is important to develop tools and techniques to improve app quality and performance. Our work focuses on a problem related to hardware sensors on Android devices: the failure to disable unneeded sensors, which leads to sensor leaks and thus battery drain. We propose the Sentinel testing tool to uncover such leaks. The tool performs static analysis of app code and produces a model which maps GUI events to callback methods that affect sensor behavior. Edges in the model are labeled with symbols representing the acquiring/releasing of sensors and the opening/closing of UI windows. The model is traversed to identify paths that are likely to exhibit sensor leaks during run-time execution based on two context-free languages over the symbol alphabet. The reported paths are then used to generate test cases. The execution of each test case tracks the run-time behavior of sensors and reports observed leaks. This approach has been applied to both open-sourced and closed-sourced regular Android applications as well as watch faces for Android Wear smartwatches. Our experimental results indicate that Sentinel effectively detects sensor leaks, while focusing the testing efforts on a very small subset of possible GUI event sequences.},

  abstract = {Watermarks have long been applied to ensure the authenticity of media contents. Computer software is an intellectual outcome in the digital domain. Therefore, it has to face all the common threats like illegal redistribution, copying, misuse through malicious modification. However, the majority of the existing software watermarking techniques are suffering from the limitations of existing robustness notions and lack of resilience from a variety of attacks. In this paper, we proposed a novel robust software watermarking scheme based on “shellcode”. It is a small piece of code generally used as the payload in the exploitation of a software vulnerability. It consists of a list of carefully arranged machine instructions, executed through injecting into a running application. Shellcode serves as the backbone of our proposed watermarking scheme. It is used to achieve both covert communication (steganography), and deterrence (watermarking) process in the proposed watermarking technique. Such a combination gives more robustness and security to the whole process. In this paper, we introduce ShellMark as a proof of concept to illustrate the shellcode based software watermarking technique. We compared and tested ShellMark with already existing software watermarking techniques, and it showed that ShellMark is resilient to most of the well known watermarking attacks.},

  abstract = {The Internet of things (IoT) is the extension of Internet connectivity into physical devices and everyday objects. These IoT devices can communicate with others over the Internet and fully integrate into people’s daily life. In recent years, IoT devices still suffer from basic security vulnerabilities making them vulnerable to a variety of threats and malware, especially IoT botnets. Unlike common malware on desktop personal computer and Android, heterogeneous processor architecture issue on IoT devices brings various challenges for researchers. Many studies take advantages of well-known dynamic or static analysis for detecting and classifying botnet on IoT devices. However, almost studies yet cannot address the multi-architecture issue and consume vast computing resources for analyzing. In this paper, we propose a lightweight method for detecting IoT botnet, which based on extracting high-level features from function–call graphs, called PSI-Graph, for each executable file. This feature shows the effectiveness when dealing with the multi-architecture problem while avoiding the complexity of control flow graph analysis that is used by most of the existing methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.7\%, with the dataset of 11,200 ELF files consisting of 7199 IoT botnet samples and 4001 benign samples. Additionally, a comparative study with other existing methods demonstrates that our approach delivers better outcome. Lastly, we make the source code of this work available to Github.},

  abstract = {The Android operating system dominates the smartphone market. Thus, to service the market, the number of Android applications has risen dramatically. These applications are processing a great amount of sensitive data, which could result in various concerns including data leakage and privacy violations. For example, applications may misuse the sensitive data stored on Android devices and violate the privacy of the user. Therefore, it is essential to maintain user privacy and protect sensitive data from leakage. Static data flow analysis approaches are used for analyzing Android applications to uncover security and privacy issues. However, these approaches frequently generate false alarms, given the different challenges created by Android applications, such as inter-component communication (ICC), reflection, and implicit flow. This work presents the DroidRista approach for conducting static data flow analysis on Android applications to detect sensitive data leakage. DroidRista analyzes ICC, reflection, and implicit flow in Android applications. To evaluate the performance of DroidRista, it was tested on three data sets. The results demonstrate improved performance in terms of detecting data leakage compared to existing static data flow analysis approaches.},

It can be reduced to a graph isomorphism problem between the Control Flow Graphs , Call Graphs or other forms of graphs of the compared programs. Here we present REveal, a prototype tool which implements a binary diffing algorithm and an associated set of features, extracted from a binary’s CG and CFGs. Additionally, we explore the potential of applying Markov lumping techniques on function CFGs. The proposed algorithm and features are evaluated in a series of experiments on executables compiled for i386 , amd64 , arm and aarch64 . Furthermore, the effectiveness of our prototype tool, code-named REveal, is assessed in a second series of experiments involving clustering of a corpus of 18 malware samples into 5 malware families. REveal’s results are compared against those produced by Diaphora, the most widely used binary diffing software of the public domain. We conclude that REveal improves the state-of-the-art in binary diffing by achieving higher matching scores, obtained at the cost of a slight running time increase, in most of the experiments conducted. Furthermore, REveal successfully partitions the malware corpus into clusters consisting of samples of the same malware family.},

The vibration response on the surface quality is quite different based on different modes of vibration. Purpose Current study proposed a new approach of modes decoupling based on Operational Deflection Shape (ODS) and structural sensitivity analysis, which used to identify the structural vibrations on surface topography in manufacturing process. Method According to the modes decoupling based on the ODS method, the dominant vibration frequencies of machine tool are identified in a wide range of frequency band. Furthermore, the modal mass distribution matrix analysis is used to determine the sensitive structures that cause greater machining errors. A milling process is used to conduct experiments. Results The experimental and theoretical results indicate that (i) the contribution of dominant vibration frequency to the vibration of machine tool is larger than weak modes vibration and (ii) the sensitive structure has higher vibration energy than the insensitive structures. Conclusion The multimode vibration at dominant frequencies of the sensitive structures (MVDFSS) directly can determine the surface topography of the products.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of Android-based smartphones made it an important target for malicious applications’ developers. So, a large number of frameworks have been proposed to tackle the huge number of daily published malwares. Despite there are many review papers that have been conducted in order to shed light on the works that achieved in Android malware analysing domain, the number of conducted review papers do not fit with the importance of this research field and with the volume of achieved works. Also, there is no comprehensive taxonomy for all research trends in the field of analysing malicious applications targeting the Android system. Furthermore, none of the existing review papers contains a schematic model that makes it easy for the reader to know the methods and methodologies used in a particular field of research without much effort. This paper aims at proposing a comprehensive taxonomy and suggesting a new schematic review approach. To this end, a review of a large number of works that achieved between 2009 and 2019 has been conducted. The achieved study includes more than 200 papers that have different goals such as apps’ behaviour analysis, automatic user interface triggers or packer/unpacker frameworks development. Also, a comprehensive taxonomy has been proposed so that most of the previous works can be classified under it. To the best of our knowledge, the suggested taxonomy is the widest and the most comprehensive in terms of the covered research trends. Moreover, we have proposed a detailed schematic model (called Schematic Review Model) illustrates the process of detecting the malignant applications of an Android in the light of the studied works and the proposed taxonomy. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the Android malware detection methods have been explained in this way with this amount of detail. Furthermore, the studied researches have been analysed according to multiple criteria such as used analysing method, used features, used detection method, and used dataset. Also, the features used in the studied works were discussed in detail by dividing it into multiple classes. Moreover, the challenges facing Android’s malware analysing methods were discussed in detail. Finally, it has been concluded that there are gaps between the size and the goal of the conducted works and the number of malicious apps published every day, so some future works areas have been proposed and discussed.},

  abstract = {When developing new software, third-party libraries are commonly used to reduce implementation efforts. However, even these libraries undergo evolution activities to offer new functionalities and fix bugs or security issues. The research community has mainly investigated third-party libraries in the context of desktop applications, while only little is known regarding the mobile context. In this paper, we bridge this gap by investigating when, how, and why mobile developers update third-party libraries. By mining 2752 mobile apps, we study (i) whether mobile developers update third-party libraries, (ii) how much such apps lag behind the latest version of their dependencies, (iii) which are the categories of libraries that are more prone to be updated, and (iv) what are the common patterns followed by developers when updating a library. Then, we perform a survey with 73 mobile developers that aims at shedding lights on the reasons why they update (or not) third-party libraries. We find that mobile developers rarely update libraries, and when they do, they mainly tend to update libraries related to the Graphical User Interface. Avoiding bug propagation and making the app compatible with new Android releases are the top reasons why developers update their libraries.},

  abstract = {The growing popularity of Android applications has generated increased concerns over the danger of piracy and the spread of malware, and particularly of adware: malware that seeks to present unwanted advertisements to the user. A popular way to distribute malware in the mobile world is through repackaging of legitimate apps. This process consists of downloading, unpacking, manipulating, recompiling an application, and publishing it again in an app store. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of over 15,000 apps to gain insights into the factors that drive the spread of repackaged apps. We also examine the motivations of developers who publish repackaged apps and those of users who download them, as well as the factors that determine which apps are chosen for repackaging, and the ways in which the apps are modified during the repackaging process. Having observed that adware is particularly prevalent in repackaged apps, we focus on this type of malware and examine how the app is modified when it is injected in an app’s code. Our findings shed much needed light on this class of malware that can be useful to security experts, and allow us to make recommendations that could lead to the creation of more effective malware detection tools, Furthermore, on the basis of our results, we propose a novel app indexing scheme that minimizes the number of comparisons needed to detect repackaged apps.},

Majority of ransomware families are requesting for a ransom payment to restore a custodian access or decrypt data which were encrypted by the ransomware earlier.

Therefore, a ransomware feature taxonomy would advance cyber defenders’ understanding of associated risks of ransomware.

CKC is a well-established model in industry that describes stages of cyber intrusion attempts. To ease the challenge of applying our taxonomy in real world, we also provide the corresponding ransomware defence taxonomy aligned with Courses of Action matrix (an intelligence-driven defence model).

These efforts have resulted in tools and techniques capable of detecting vulnerabilities and malicious behaviors in apps. However, there has been no evaluation of the effectiveness of these tools and techniques in detecting known vulnerabilities. The absence of such evaluations puts app developers at a disadvantage when choosing security analysis tools to secure their apps. In this regard, we evaluated the effectiveness of vulnerability detection tools for Android apps. We reviewed 64 tools and empirically evaluated 14 vulnerability detection tools against 42 known unique vulnerabilities captured by Ghera benchmarks, which are composed of both vulnerable and secure apps. Of the 20 observations from the evaluation, the main observation is existing vulnerability detection tools for Android apps are very limited in their ability to detect known vulnerabilities — all of the evaluated tools together could only detect 30 of the 42 known unique vulnerabilities . More effort is required if security analysis tools are to help developers build secure apps. We hope the observations from this evaluation will help app developers choose appropriate security analysis tools and persuade tool developers and researchers to identify and address limitations in their tools and techniques. We also hope this evaluation will catalyze or spark a conversation in the software engineering and security communities to require a more rigorous and explicit evaluation of security analysis tools and techniques.},

Code splitting is a hardening technique that moves selected chunks of code from client to server. Although widely adopted, the effective benefits of code splitting are not fully understood and thoroughly assessed. Objective The objective of this work is to compare non protected code vs. code splitting protected code, considering two levels of the chunk size parameter, in order to assess the effectiveness of the protection - in terms of both attack time and success rate - and to understand the attack strategy and process used to overcome the protection. Method We conducted an experiment with master students performing attack tasks on a small application hardened with different levels of protection. Students carried out their task working at the source code level. Results We observed a statistically significant effect of code splitting on the attack success rate that, on the average, was reduced from 89\% with unprotected clear code to 52\% with the most effective protection. The protection variant that moved some small-sized code chunks turned out to be more effective than the alternative moving fewer but larger chunks. Different strategies were identified yielding different success rates. Moreover we discovered that successful attacks exhibited different process w.r.t. failed ones. Conclusions We found empirical evidence of the effect of code splitting, assessed the relative magnitude, and evaluated the influence of the chunk size parameter. Moreover we extracted the process used to overcome such obfuscation technique.},

  abstract = {Mobile ads are plagued with fraudulent clicks which is a major challenge for the advertising community. Although popular ad networks use many techniques to detect click fraud, they do not protect the client from possible collusion between publishers and ad networks. In addition, ad networks are not able to monitor the user’s activity for click fraud detection once they are redirected to the advertising site after clicking the ad. We propose a new crowdsource-based system called Click Fraud Crowdsourcing (CFC) that collaborates with both advertisers and ad networks in order to protect both parties from any possible click fraudulent acts. The system benefits from both a global view, where it gathers multiple ad requests corresponding to different ad network-publisher-advertiser combinations, and a local view, where it is able to track the users’ engagement in each advertising website. The results demonstrated that our approach offers a lower false positive rate (0.1) when detecting click fraud as opposed to proposed solutions in the literature, while maintaining a high true positive rate (0.9). Furthermore, we propose a new mobile ad charging model that benefits from our system to charge advertisers based on the duration spent in the advertiser’s website.},

Performance benchmarks show that our system is comparable with professional tools and able to withstand VM detection. By using Mac-A-Mal, we discovered 71 unknown adware samples (8 of them using valid distribution certificates), 2 keyloggers, and 1 previously unseen trojan involved in the APT32 OceanLotus.},

  abstract = {Android devices are shipped in several flavors by more than 100 manufacturer partners, which extend the Android “vanilla” OS with new system services, and modify the existing ones. These proprietary extensions expose Android devices to reliability and security issues. In this paper, we propose a coverage-guided fuzzing platform ( Chizpurfle ) based on evolutionary algorithms to test proprietary Android system services. A key feature of this platform is the ability to profile coverage on the actual, unmodified Android device, by taking advantage of dynamic binary re-writing techniques. We applied this solution on three high-end commercial Android smartphones. The results confirmed that evolutionary fuzzing is able to test Android OS system services more efficiently than blind fuzzing. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of different choices for the fitness function and selection algorithm.},

  abstract = {Android-based smartphones are gaining popularity, due to its cost efficiency and various applications. These smartphones provide the full experience of a computing device to its user, and usually ends up being used as a personal computer. Since the Android operating system is open-source software, many contributors are adding to its development to make the interface more attractive and tweaking the performance. In order to gain more popularity, many refined versions are being offered to customers, whose feedback will enable it to be made even more powerful and user-friendly. However, this has attracted many malicious code-writers to gain anonymous access to the user’s private data. Moreover, the malware causes an increase of resource consumption. To prevent this, various techniques are currently being used that include static analysis-based detection and dynamic analysis-based detection. But, due to the enhancement in Android malware code-writing techniques, some of these techniques are getting overwhelmed. Therefore, there is a need for an effective Android malware detection approach for which experimental studies were conducted in the present work using the static features of the Android applications such as Standard Permissions with Application Programming Interface (API) calls, Non-standard Permissions with API-calls, API-calls with Standard and Nonstandard Permissions. To select the prominent features, Feature Selection Techniques (FSTs) such as the BI-Normal Separation (BNS), Mutual Information (MI), Relevancy Score (RS), and the Kullback-Leibler (KL) were employed and their effectiveness was measured using the Linear-Support Vector Machine (L-SVM) classifier. It was observed that this classifier achieved Android malware detection accuracy of 99.6\% for the combined features as recommended by the BI-Normal Separation FST.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an examination of several side-channel attack scenarios on PC-based cryptosystems. Our goal was the development of a unified physical model for sensitive information leakage. The main focus of our work was electromagnetic side channels since signals with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be more conveniently captured. Moreover, the attacker can make correlations of the EM signal with other types of side-channel signals (such as voltage fluctuations and acoustic emanations). It shows that there may be a common source for a vulnerable signal that passes through several sides channels. We have simulated several attacks on targeted cryptosystems with distinct instruction sets. Trace analysis reveals empirical evidence. which corresponds to the theoretical principles of the mechanisms x86 and x64 processors. Hardware reasons for leakage come from the instructions and data in the processor cache, to be specific, from the fluctuations of power consumption, leading to changes in the voltage regulator of the processor. Thus, the fluctuations in LC circuits result in leakage on multiple side channels. In general, the obtained data together with the principles of signal formation can be used in vulnerability testing, which can examine side-channel robustness of cryptographic software on the first steps of development.},

IoT improves user experiences by allowing a large number of smart devices to connect and share information. Many existing malware attacks, targeted at traditional computers connected to the Internet, may also be directed at IoT devices. Therefore, efficient protection at IoT devices could save millions of internet users from malicious activities. However, existing malware detection approaches suffer from high computational complexity. In this study, we propose a more accurate and fast model for detecting malware in the IoT environment. We introduce a Malware Threat Hunting System (MTHS) in the proposed model. MTHS first converts malware binary into a color image and then conducts the machine or deep learning analysis for efficient malware detection. We finally prepare a baseline to compare the performance of MTHS with traditional state-of-the-art malware detection approaches. We conduct experiments on two public datasets of Windows and Android software. The experimental results indicate that the response time and the detection accuracy of MTHS are better than those of previous machine learning and deep learning approaches.},

  abstract = {Software localization is the process of adapting a software product to the linguistic, cultural and technical requirements of a target market. It allows software companies to access foreign markets that would be otherwise difficult to penetrate. Many studies have been carried out to locate need-to-translate strings in software and adapt UI layout after text translation in the new language. However, no work has been done on the most important and time-consuming step of software localization process, i.e., the translation of software text. Due to some unique characteristics of software text, for example, application-specific meanings, context-sensitive translation, domain-specific rare words, general machine translation tools such as Google Translate cannot properly address linguistic and technical nuance in translating software text for software localization. In this paper, we propose a neural-network based translation model specifically designed and trained for mobile application text translation. We collect large-scale human-translated bilingual sentence pairs inside different Android applications, which are crawled from Google Play store. We customize the original RNN encoder-decoder neural machine translation model by adding categorical information addressing the domain-specific rare word problem which is common phenomenon in software text. We evaluate our approach in translating the text of testing Android applications by both BLEU score and exact match rate. The results show that our method outperforms the general machine translation tool, Google Translate, and generates more acceptable translation for software localization with less needs for human revision. Our approach is language independent, and we show the generality of our approach between English and the other five official languages used in United Nation (UN).},

Although GitHub currently hosts more than six thousand active Blockchain software (BCS) projects, few software engineering researchers have investigated these projects and their contributors. Although the number of BCS projects is growing rapidly, the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers remain a puzzle. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to understand the motivations, challenges, and needs of BCS developers and analyze the differences between BCS and non-BCS development . On this goal, we sent an online survey to 1,604 active BCS developers identified by mining the GitHub repositories of 145 popular BCS projects. The survey received 156 responses that met our criteria for analysis. The results suggest that the majority of the BCS developers are experienced in non-BCS development and are primarily motivated by the ideology of creating a decentralized financial system. Although most of the BCS projects are Open Source Software (OSS) projects by nature, more than 93\% of our respondents found BCS development somewhat different from a non-BCS development as BCS projects have higher emphasis on security and reliability than most of the non-BCS projects. Other differences include: higher costs of defects, decentralized and hostile environment, technological complexity, and difficulty in upgrading the software after release. These differences were also the primary sources of challenges to them. Software development tools that are tuned for non-BCS development are inadequate for BCS and the ecosystem needs an array of new or improved tools, such as: customized IDE for BCS development tasks, debuggers for smart-contracts, testing support, easily deployable simulators, and BCS domain specific design notations.},

  abstract = {The automatic verification of time properties of models extracted from programs is challenging, mainly because modern programming languages, such as Java, represent time without a proper semantics. Current approaches to extract time models from source code either represent time only as a tree-like sequence of events or require developers to manually provide a formal model of the time behavior. This makes it difficult for software developers to verify various aspects of their systems, such as timeouts, delays and periodicity of the execution. In this paper, we introduce a formal definition of the time semantics for the Java programming language. Based on the semantics, we present an approach to automatically extract timed automata and their time constraints from Java programs at method level. First, our approach detects the Java statements that involve time, from which it then extracts the timed automata. Our extracted automata are directly amenable to the verification of time properties of the corresponding Java methods. We evaluated the accuracy of our approach on twenty open source Java projects that implement time behavior in their source code. The results show that our approach achieves 100\% precision and recall in identifying time related information. They also show that 95\% of the timed automata extracted from source code correctly model the time behavior of the method. Finally, we show the applicability of our timed automata to identify eight real errors in four open source Apache systems.},

  abstract = {Malicious behavior detection is a key topic that has been a focus in the field of intrusion detection. Current intrusion detection systems are primarily based on single-point monitoring and detection and cannot detect attack modes with a hidden attack frequency. The idea presented in this paper is the incorporation of API call sequence software into the analysis and the construction of behavior chains to express the behavior patterns in software. This paper introduces related definitions of behavioral points and behaviors and proposes a depth-detection method for malware based on behavior chains (MALDC). The method monitors behavior points based on API calls and then uses the calling sequence of those behavior points at runtime to construct a behavior chain. Finally, we use depth detection method based on long short-term memory(LSTM) to detect malicious behavior from the behavior chains. To verify the performance of the proposed model, we conducted a large experiment on 54,324 malware and 53,361 benign samples collected from Windows systems and used those samples to train and test the model. Comparative verification by using various classifiers showed that the behavior points extracted based on the above method and the constructed behavior chains can be used to recognize malicious behavior at a high recognition rate. The method achieved an accuracy of 98.64\% with a false positive rate of less than 2\% in the best case, which is a satisfactory recognition rate for detecting malicious software behavior.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel code clone search technique that is accurate, incremental, and scalable to hundreds of million lines of code. Our technique incorporates multiple code representations (i.e., a technique to transform code into various representations to capture different types of clones), query reduction (i.e., a technique to select clone search keywords based on their uniqueness), and a customised ranking function (i.e., a technique to allow a specific clone type to be ranked on top of the search results) to improve clone search performance. We implemented the technique in a clone search tool, called Siamese, and evaluated its search accuracy and scalability on three established clone data sets. Siamese offers the highest mean average precision of 95\% and 99\% on two clone benchmarks compared to seven state-of-the-art clone detection tools, and reported the largest number of Type-3 clones compared to three other code search engines. Siamese is scalable and can return cloned code snippets within 8 seconds for a code corpus of 365 million lines of code. Using an index of 130,719 GitHub projects, we demonstrate that Siamese’s incremental indexing capability dramatically decreases the index preparation time for large-scale data sets with multiple releases of software projects. The paper discusses the applications of Siamese to facilitate software development and research with two use cases including online code clone detection and clone search with automated license analysis.},

In practice, the level of implementation knowledge required is only attainable through significant reverse-engineering efforts. In this paper, we describe new approaches to assess the security of white-box implementations which require neither knowledge about the look-up tables used nor expensive reverse-engineering efforts. We introduce the differential computation analysis (DCA) attack which is the software counterpart of the differential power analysis attack as applied by the cryptographic hardware community. Similarly, the differential fault analysis (DFA) attack is the software counterpart of fault injection attacks on cryptographic hardware. For DCA, we developed plugins to widely available dynamic binary instrumentation (DBI) frameworks to produce software execution traces which contain information about the memory addresses being accessed. For the DFA attack, we developed modified emulators and plugins for DBI frameworks that allow injecting faults at selected moments within the execution of the encryption or decryption process as well as a framework to automate static fault injection. To illustrate the effectiveness, we show how DCA and DFA can extract the secret key from numerous publicly available non-commercial white-box implementations of standardized cryptographic algorithms. These approaches allow one to extract the secret key material from white-box implementations significantly faster and without specific knowledge of the white-box design in an automated or semi-automated manner.},

  abstract = {Logging is a common practice in software engineering. Prior research has investigated the characteristics of logging practices in system software (e.g., web servers or databases) as well as desktop applications. However, despite the popularity of mobile apps, little is known about their logging practices. In this paper, we sought to study logging practices in mobile apps. In particular, we conduct a case study on 1,444 open source Android apps in the F-Droid repository. Through a quantitative study, we find that although mobile app logging is less pervasive than server and desktop applications, logging is leveraged in almost all studied apps. However, we find that there exist considerable differences between the logging practices of mobile apps and the logging practices in server and desktop applications observed by prior studies. In order to further understand such differences, we conduct a firehouse email interview and a qualitative annotation on the rationale of using logs in mobile app development. By comparing the logging level of each logging statement with developers’ rationale of using the logs, we find that all too often (35.4\%), the chosen logging level and the rationale are inconsistent. Such inconsistency may prevent the useful runtime information to be recorded or may generate unnecessary logs that may cause performance overhead. Finally, to understand the magnitude of such performance overhead, we conduct a performance evaluation between generating all the logs and not generating any logs in eight mobile apps. In general, we observe a statistically significant performance overhead based on various performance metrics (response time, CPU and battery consumption). In addition, we find that if the performance overhead of logging is significantly observed in an app, disabling the unnecessary logs indeed provides a statistically significant performance improvement. Our results show the need for a systematic guidance and automated tool support to assist in mobile logging practices.},

  abstract = {The competitive market of mobile applications (apps) has driven app developers to pay more attention to addressing the issues of mobile apps. Prior studies have shown that addressing the issues that are reported in user-reviews shares a statistically significant relationship with star-ratings. However, despite the prevalence and importance of user-reviews and issue reports prioritization, no prior research has analyzed the relationship between issue reports prioritization and star-ratings. In this paper, we integrate user-reviews into the process of issue reports prioritization. We propose an approach to map issue reports that are recorded in issue tracking systems to user-reviews. Through an empirical study of 326 open-source Android apps, our approach achieves a precision of 79\% in matching user-reviews with issue reports. Moreover, we observe that prioritizing the issue reports that are related to user-reviews shares a significant positive relationship with star-ratings. Furthermore, we use the top apps, in terms of star-ratings, to train a model for prioritizing issue reports. It is a good practice to learn from the top apps as there is no well-established approach for prioritizing issue reports. The results show that mobile apps with a similar prioritization approach to our trained model achieve higher star-ratings.},

  abstract = {As the number of Android applications (apps) is increasing dramatically, users face a serious problem to find relevant apps to their needs. Therefore, there is an important demand for app search engines or recommendation services where developing an accurate similarity method is a challenging issue. Contrary to malware detection, very fewer efforts have been devoted to similarity computation of apps. Furthermore, all the existing methods use the features obtained only from the app stores such as description and rating, which could be inaccurate , varied in different stores, and affected by language barrier ; they totally neglect useful information clearly capturing the app’s functionalities and behaviors that can be mined from the apps themselves such as the API calls and manifest information. In this paper, we propose an effective method called SimAndro to compute the similarity of apps, which extracts the features based on the information obtained only from apps themselves and the Android platform without using information obtained from third-party sources such as app stores. SimAndro performs both feature extraction and similarity computation where the API calls , manifest information , package name , and strings are used as features. To compute the similarity score of an app-pair, a separate similarity score is computed based on each feature, and a weighted linear combination of these four scores is regarded as the final similarity score by utilizing an automatic weighting scheme based on TreeRankSVM . The results of extensive experiments with three real-world datasets and a dataset constructed by human experts demonstrate the effectiveness of SimAndro.},

  abstract = {Since Android is the most widely used operating system for mobile devices, it has been a target for widespread malware attacks. During the past years, many new malware detection mechanisms have been introduced for the Android platform. These methods are generally classified as static analysis and dynamic analysis methods. However, none of the existing mechanisms are able to detect the malware applications with reasonable false positive and negative rates. This is a major concern in the field of Android malware detection. In this paper, we propose a novel malware detection mechanism by combining the estimated malicious probability values of three distinct naive Bayes classifiers based on API calls, permissions, and system calls using Bayesian model averaging approach. The majority of the existing Android malwares have signatures in at least one of API calls, permissions, or system call sequences. Hence, the proposed mechanism can overcome the limitations of the existing static and dynamic malware detection mechanism to a good extent. Our experiments have shown that the proposed mechanism is more accurate than the existing static and dynamic malware detection mechanisms.},

Considering three types of Android behavior characteristics, a three-layer hybrid algorithm was proposed. And it combined the malicious code detection based on digital signature to improve the detection efficiency. The digital signature of the known malicious code was extracted to form a malicious sample library. The authority that can reflect Android malicious behavior, API call and the running system call features were also extracted. An expandable hybrid discriminant algorithm was designed for the above three types of features. The algorithm was tested with machine learning method by constructing the optimal classifier suitable for the above features. Finally, the Android malicious code detection system was designed and implemented based on the multi-layer hybrid algorithm. The experimental results show that the system performs Android malicious code detection based on the combination of signature and dynamic and static features. Compared with other related work, the system has better performance in execution efficiency and detection rate.},

Aiming at the problem that static analysis cannot verify whether the sensitive path is triggered by reality, this paper proposes a system ADS-SA based on static analysis to automatically detect sensitive path. The system first constructs an Android component conversion diagram through data flow analysis, and then obtains an Android function call graph through control flow analysis. Secondly, the sensitive path backtracking algorithm is designed and used to obtain the sensitive path set. Finally, the automated testing framework, Appium, is used to trigger and verify the authenticity of the sensitive path set. The test results show that the ADS-SA can automatically detect more than 87\% of sensitive paths at a low time cost with high reliability and effectiveness.},

However, the exact nature of such an interpreter and of the required technique for specialization were never specified. In this work, we propose a Prolog meta-interpreter which applies the desired non-standard selection rule and which is amenable to specialization using offline partial deduction. After the initial analysis phase of compiling control, we collect annotations to specialize the interpreter using the Logen system for offline partial deduction. We also show that the result of the specialization is equivalent to the program obtained using the traditional approach to compiling control. In this way, we simplify the synthesis step.},

As the most mainstream method currently, signature-based detecting is confronted with many obfuscation methods which can hide the true signature of malware. In our research, we propose a logic signature-based malware detecting method to overcome the shortcoming of being susceptible to disturbance in data signature-based method. Firstly, we achieve the logic of basic block based on Symbolic execution and Static Single Assignment, and then use a set of expression trees to represent the basic block logic, the trees set will be filtered to pick out the remarkable items. Depending on basic block logic trees set, we use n-gram method to select features for the discrimination of malicious and benign software. Every feature of program is a sequence of basic block logic and the feature matching is based on edit distance calculating. We design and implement a detector and evaluate its effectiveness by comparing with data signature-based detector. The experimental results indicate that the proposed malware detector using logic signature of basic block sequence has a higher performance than data signature-based detectors.},

  abstract = {The increasing complexity of modern programs motivates software engineers to often rely on the support of third-party libraries. Although this practice allows application developers to achieve a compelling time-to-market, it often makes the final product bloated with conspicuous chunks of unused code. Other than making a program unnecessarily large, this dormant code could be leveraged by willful attackers to harm users. As a consequence, several techniques have been recently proposed to perform program debloating and remove (or secure) dead code from applications. However, state-of-the-art approaches are either based on unsound strategies, thus producing unreliable results, or pose too strict assumptions on the program itself. In this work, we propose a novel abstract domain, called Signedness-Agnostic Strided Interval , which we use as the cornerstone to design a novel and sound static technique, based on abstract interpretation, to reliably perform program debloating. Throughout the paper, we detail the specifics of our approach and show its effectiveness and usefulness by implementing it in a tool, called BinTrimmer , to perform static program debloating on binaries. Our evaluation shows that BinTrimmer can remove up to 65.6\% of a library’s code and that our domain is, on average, 98\% more precise than the related work.},

  abstract = {Abstract Besides various other privacy concerns with mobile devices, many people suspect their smartphones to be secretly eavesdropping on them. In particular, a large number of reports has emerged in recent years claiming that private conversations conducted in the presence of smartphones seemingly resulted in targeted online advertisements. These rumors have not only attracted media attention, but also the attention of regulatory authorities. With regard to explaining the phenomenon, opinions are divided both in public debate and in research. While one side dismisses the eavesdropping suspicions as unrealistic or even paranoid, many others are fully convinced of the allegations or at least consider them plausible. To help structure the ongoing controversy and dispel misconceptions that may have arisen, this paper provides a holistic overview of the issue, reviewing and analyzing existing arguments and explanatory approaches from both sides. Based on previous research and our own analysis, we challenge the widespread assumption that the spying fears have already been disproved. While confirming a lack of empirical evidence, we cannot rule out the possibility of sophisticated large-scale eavesdropping attacks being successful and remaining undetected. Taking into account existing access control mechanisms, detection methods, and other technical aspects, we point out remaining vulnerabilities and research gaps.},

We propose to monitor the victim process using an independent monitoring (detector) process, that continuously measures selected Performance Monitoring Counters (PMC) to detect the presence of an attack. Ad-hoc countermeasures can be applied only when such a risky situation arises. In our case, the victim process is the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption algorithm and the attack is performed by means of random encryption requests. We demonstrate that PMCs are a feasible tool to detect the attack and that sampling PMCs at high frequencies is worse than sampling at lower frequencies in terms of detection capabilities, particularly when the attack is fragmented in time to try to be hidden from detection.},

Further, individuals must also be given detailed information about what, how and what for data is collected. Consent is typically obtained at the collection point and, at a single point in time (ignoring updates), associated with Privacy Policies or End-User Agreements. At any moment, both the user and the organization should be able to produce evidence of this consent. This proof should not be disputable which leads us to strong cryptographic properties. The problem we discuss is how to robustly demonstrate such consent was given. We adapt fair-exchange protocols to this particular problem and, upon an exchange of personal data, we are able to produce a cryptographic receipt of acceptance that any party can use to prove consent and elicit non-repudiation. We discuss two broad strategies: a pure peer-to-peer scheme and the use of a Trusted Third Party.},

We propose a machine learning system for detecting PE vulnerability. Our method is component-based detection, which means a more granular method. In this way, we can not only identify App with problems, but also locate component with loopholes. We first analyze the principle of PE vulnerability’s formation process, and then propose an EMPC model according to key elements in the process. The model is used to select features in the following steps. Second, we apply machine learning techniques to build a classification model to classify samples. Seven classification algorithms are applied. The experiment results show that our method is feasible in detecting PE vulnerability in component-degree.},

  abstract = {Because of the great loss and damage caused by malwares, malware detection has become a central issue of computer security. It has to be fast and very accurate. To develop suitable methods on needs very good quality benchmarks. One such benchmark is the Microsoft Kaggle malware challenge system run in 2015. Since then over 50 papers were published on this system. The best result were achieved with complex feature engineering. In this work we analyze the black-box neural method and what is novel analyze its results against the Microsoft Kaggle malware challenge benchmark. It is tempting to use convolution neural networks for malware analysis following the great success with analysis of images. Even the use of balanced classes and drop-out convergence does not beat XGBoost with feature engineering, although some room for improvement exists. The situation is similar to that for language analysis. The language is much more hierarchical than image, and apparently malware is too. The malware analysis still awaits optimal neural network architecture.},

  abstract = {Vulnerability analysts protecting software lack adequate tools for understanding data flow in binaries. We present a case study in which we used human factors methods to develop a taxonomy for understanding data flow and the visual representations needed to support decision making for binary vulnerability analysis. Using an iterative process, we refined and evaluated the taxonomy by generating three different data flow visualizations for small binaries, trained an analyst to use these visualizations, and tested the utility of the visualizations for answering data flow questions. Throughout the process and with minimal training, analysts were able to use the visualizations to understand data flow related to security assessment. Our results indicate that the data flow taxonomy is promising as a mechanism for improving analyst understanding of data flow in binaries and for supporting efficient decision making during analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with improvement of malware protection efficiency. The analysis of applied scientific research on malware protection development has shown that improvement of the methods for deobfuscation of program code being analyzed is one of the main means of increasing efficiency of malware recognition. This paper demonstrates that the main drawback of the modern-day deobfuscation methods is that they are insufficiently adapted to the formalized presentation of the functional semantics of programs being tested. Based on the research results, we suggest that theoretical solutions which have been tried out in program code optimization procedures may be used for code deobfuscation. In the course of the study, we have developed a program code deobfuscation procedure utilizing a value state dependence graph. Utilization of the developed procedure was found to enable presentation of the functional semantics of the programs being tested in a graph form. As the result, identification of malware based on its execution semantics became possible. The paper shows that further research should focus on the development of a method for comparison of the value state dependence graph of the program being tested with corresponding graphs of security software and malware.},

In order to improve efficiency, various techniques such as symbolical execution and taint tracking have been applied to software Fuzzing. Due to the lack of uniform and standardized test samples, researchers can only use existing software for testing. Therefore, there are sample differences when compared with existing technologies, and it is impossible to accurately measure the advantages and disadvantages of different technologies. In this paper, we propose a source-based software vulnerability auto-generation technology, through the analysis of the source code structure characteristics, to find the potential vulnerability insertion point, combined with known types of vulnerabilities, and automatically insert the vulnerability into the source code. We selected some open source projects such as coreutils as the test target, and inserted multiple vulnerabilities in the source code.

These traditional detection methods have a common limitation: they are not adaptive. The detection methods based on artificial immune system, such as dendritic cell algorithm, have some self-adaptability, but they depend too much on artificial experience, and the self-adaptability is obviously insufficient. Therefore, in order to overcome the lack of self-adaptability of existing detection methods, this paper introduces a change perception method based on danger theory to detect malicious software by looking for change in Android mobile phone system, that is, danger signal. When studying the generation of dangerous signal, this paper uses the method of describing the law of function change in mathematics to describe the change in smartphone system with the concept of differential, and then defines and expresses dangerous signal. Considering the discrete type of data in Android mobile phone system, this paper realizes the expression of dangerous signal based on the theory of numerical differentiation, and puts forward the method of calculating dangerous signal in Android system.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present BinEye , an innovative tool which trains a system of three convolutional neural networks to characterize the authors of program binaries based on novel sets of features. The first set of features is obtained by converting an executable binary code into a gray image; the second by transforming each executable into a series of bytecode; and the third by representing each function in terms of its opcodes. By leveraging advances in deep learning, we are then able to characterize a large set of authors. This is accomplished even without the missing features and despite the complications arising from compilation. In fact, BinEye does not require any prior knowledge of the target binary. More important, an analysis of the model provides a satisfying explanation of the results obtained: BinEye is able to auto-learn each author’s coding style and thus characterize the authors of program binaries. We evaluated BinEye on large datasets extracted from selected open-source C++ projects in GitHub, Google Code Jam events, and several programming projects, comparing it wiexperimental results demonstrate that BinEye characterizes a larger number of authors with a significantly higher accuracy (above 90\%). We also employed it in the context of several case studies. When applied to Zeus and Citadel, BinEye found that this pair might be associated with common authors. For other packages, BinEye demonstrated its ability to identify the presence of multiple authors in binary code.},

The password authentication protocol transmits passwords in plaintext, which makes the authentication vulnerable to eavesdropping and replay attacks, and several protocols have been proposed to protect against this. However, we find that secure password authentication protocols are often implemented incorrectly in Android applications (apps). To detect the implementation flaws in password authentication code, we propose GLACIATE , a fully automated tool combining machine learning and program analysis. Instead of creating detection templates/rules manually, GLACIATE automatically and accurately learns the common authentication flaws from a relatively small training dataset, and then identifies whether the authentication flaws exist in other apps. We collected 16,387 apps from Google Play for evaluation. GLACIATE successfully identified 4,105 of these with incorrect password authentication implementations. Examining these results, we observed that a significant proportion of them had multiple flaws in their authentication code. We further compared GLACIATE with the state-of-the-art techniques to assess its detection accuracy.},

However, it also brings severe challenges to information flow security. When data is transferred and processed, the diversity of different security mechanisms in various apps make data more vulnerable to leakage. Although there are several analysis approaches on security verification on inter-component information flow, repetitive verification on the same component during complex interactions increases the overhead, which would affect task execution efficiency and consume more energy. Therefore, we propose a compositional information flow security verification approach, which improves efficiency by separating the intra-app and inter-app analysis and verification process. The experiment and analysis show that our method is more effective than traditional global approaches.},

However, while Android smart devices bring convenience to customers, they also bring problems. Due to the open-sourced nature of the Android system, malicious programs and software attacks pose a significant security risk to user data. Therefore, the detection of malware has always been a critical issue. For a long time, various malware detection schemes have been proposed, which have gradually improved the detection of malware. Traditional detection methods are based on static or dynamic detection techniques. In recent years, with the advancement of technology, malware detection based on machine learning ideas has been widely used, such as K-NN, deep learning, decision trees, and so on. Blockchain has been widely used in many fields since its birth. This paper combines traditional detection methods and ensemble learning algorithms to propose a malware detection technology based on QuorumChain framework (blockchain technology). The experimental results verify that the proposed new model is better than other models in precision, recall and f1-measure.},

The categorical structure introduced in this paper has a simple definition, combining two well-known structures, namely, closed Freyd category and compact closed category. The former is a model of effectful computation in a general setting, and the latter describes connections via channels, which cause the effect we focus on in this paper. To demonstrate the relevance of the categorical model, we show by a semantic consideration that the \\( \\pi \\) -calculus is equivalent to a core calculus of Concurrent ML.},

There are lots of users rooting their Android devices for some useful functions, which are not originally provided to developers and users, such as taking screenshot and screen recording. However, after observing the danger of rooting devices, the developers begin to look for non-root alternatives to implement those functions. Android Debug Bridge (ADB) workaround is one of the best known non-root alternatives to help app gain a higher privilege on Android. It used to be considered as a secure practice until some cases of ADB privilege leakage have been found. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify the potential privilege leakage in Android apps that using ADB workaround. We apply our approach to analyze three real-world apps that are downloaded from Google Play Store. We then present a general methodology to conduct exploitation on those apps using ADB workaround.

It first utilizes inter-procedural dataflow analysis and taint analysis to accurately identify potential IO2BO vulnerabilities. Then it uses a light-weight method to further filter out false positives. Specifically, it generates constraints representing the conditions under which a potential IO2BO vulnerability can be triggered, and feeds the constraints to SMT solver to decide their satisfiability. We have implemented a prototype system LAID based on LLVM, and evaluated it on 228 programs of the NIST’s SAMATE Juliet test suite and 6 known IO2BO vulnerabilities in real world. The experiment results show that our system can effectively and efficiently detect all known IO2BO vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {Remote control-logic injection attacks on programmable logic controllers (PLCs) impose critical threats to industrial control system (ICS) environments. For instance, Stuxnet infects the control logic of a Siemens S7-300 PLC to sabotage nuclear plants. Several control logic injection attacks have been studied in the past. However, they focus on the development and infection of PLC control logic and do not consider the stealthy methods of transferring the logic to a PLC over the network. This paper is the first effort to explore the packet manipulation of control logic to achieve stealthiness without modifying PLC firmware to support new (obfuscation) functionality. It presents two new control logic injection attacks: (1) Data Execution and (2) Fragmentation and Noise Padding. Data Execution attack subverts signatures (based-on packet-header fields) by transferring control logic to the data blocks of a PLC and then, changes the PLC’s system control flow to execute the attacker’s logic. Fragmentation and Noise Padding attack subverts deep packet inspection (DPI) by appending a sequence of padding bytes in control logic packets while keeping the size of the attacker’s logic in packet payloads significantly small. We implement the attacks on two industry-scale PLCs of different vendors and demonstrate that these attacks can subvert intrusion detection methods successfully, such as signature-based intrusion detection and Anagram-based DPI. We also release the training and attack datasets to facilitate research in this direction.},

In absence of source code, it is particularly difficult to locate vulnerabilities and malicious functionality, as crucial information is removed by the compilation process.

Moreover, data types are often essential for gaining a deeper understanding of the program logic. In this paper we present TypeMiner , a static method for recovering types in binary programs. We build on the assumption that types leave characteristic traits in compiled code that can be automatically identified using machine learning starting at usage locations determined by an analyst. We evaluate the performance of our method with 14 real world software projects written in C and show that it is able to correctly recover the data types in 76\%–93\% of the cases.},

  abstract = {In order to effectively evaluate the information security level for an intelligent and connected vehicle, a novel Intelligent Connected Vehicle (ICV) Information Security Attack and Defense (ICV-ISAD) test evaluation method is proposed in this paper. ICV-ISAD test method is based on long-term large number of real vehicle test experiments. It mainly consists of security threat and risk analysis, test strategy design, test tool call, test point mapping, test procedure execution, and remediation measures mapping. Using ICV-ISAD test method, we conducted test experiments to In-vehicle Network, Telematics Box, Engine Control Unit, In-Vehicle Infotainment, Mobile Application, Radio and Telematics Service Provider for different types of vehicle. The results show that some vulnerabilities exist in ICV’s system, such as gateway filtering vulnerability, high-risk port opening, Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Structured Query Language (SQL) injection, weak password, and cleartext network traffic (HTTP). Besides, ICV-ISAD test method could map some remediation measures or recommendations for these vulnerabilities. It denotes that ICV-ISAD test method can effectively test and evaluate the information security of ICV.},

  abstract = {By using camouflage technologies such as code confusion, packing and signature, malware could escape the killing of anti-virus software with a high probability. To detect malware efficiently, traditional machine learning methods usually require complex feature extraction work in advance, CNN and other deep learning methods usually need a large number of labeled samples, all of these will affect the detection performance. For these problems, an improved deep learning method (ColCaps) based on malware color image visualization technology and capsule network is proposed in this paper to detect malware. Firstly, the malware is transformed into a color image. Then, the dynamic routing-based capsule network is used to detect and classify the color image. Without advanced feature extraction and with only a small number of labeled samples, ColCaps has better performances in cross-platform detection and classification. The experimental results show that, the detection accuracy of the proposed method on Android and Windows platforms is 99.3\% and 96.5\% respectively, which is 20\% higher than that of the existing method. Meanwhile, the classification task in Drebin dataset has an accuracy of 98.2\%, which is a significant improvement over the prior DREBIN.},

  abstract = {Over the last few years, there has been an almost exponential growth of TLS popularity and usage, especially among applications that deal with sensitive data. However, even with this widespread use, TLS remains for many system administrators a complex subject. The main reason is that they do not have the time to understand all the cryptographic algorithms and features used in a TLS suite and their relative weaknesses. For these reasons, many different tools have been developed to verify TLS implementations. However, they usually analyze the TLS configuration and provide a list of possible attacks, without specifying their mitigations. In this paper, we present TLSAssistant , a fully-featured tool that combines state-of-the-art TLS analyzers with a report system that suggests appropriate mitigations and shows the full set of viable attacks.},

Although artificial neural networks perform very well on these tasks, they are also vulnerable to adversarial examples. An adversarial example is a sample that has minor modifications made to it so that the neural network misclassifies it. Many techniques have been proposed, both for crafting adversarial examples and for hardening neural networks against them. Most previous work was done in the image domain. Some of the attacks have been adopted to work in the malware domain which typically deals with binary feature vectors. In order to better understand the space of adversarial examples in malware classification, we study different approaches of crafting adversarial examples and defense techniques in the malware domain and compare their effectiveness on multiple data sets.},

Data obfuscation is also used to protect digital content under the Digital Rights Management (DRM) Protection. Code obfuscation can be used to protect the code. This paper proposes a variable encoding data obfuscation approach using secret sharing technique.

Utilization of Android gadgets is consistently expanding at colossal rate. As per Gartner’s report, in the cell phone working framework (OS) market, Google’s Android broadened its lead by catching 82\% of the aggregate market in the final quarter of 2016. As per a report, the quantity of mobile applications in the Google Play Store had now outperformed a check of 2.5 million applications and all are accessible for download. Advanced features have been giving the clients simplicity of person-to-person communication, managing an account, i.e., making user to transfer money around the globe. As versatile applications are increasing, thereby expanding prominence among clients, and at the same time protection and security of smartphone clients turn into a worry, its open-source nature has turned into a fascination point for spammers and malware creators to perform unintended errands. Scholastic analysts and anti-malware organizations have understood that the static investigation strategies are helpless. Specifically, the common stealth strategies, for example, encryption and code obfuscation, are equipped for creating variations of known malware. This has prompted the utilization of dynamic examination-based strategies. Since a solitary approach might be incapable against the propelled procedures, numerous corresponding methodologies can be utilized as a part of pair for powerful malware discovery. This article gives an understanding into the qualities and inadequacies of the known anti-malware techniques from year 2009 to 2017. Our contribution to this paper is we have framed comparative study of various techniques and have provide major research gaps in summarized way which gives a stage, to the scientists and specialists, toward proposing the cutting-edge Android security, examination, and malware discovery methods.},

To ensure that the untrusted module cannot escape its sandbox, existing approaches such as Google’s Native Client rely on a binary verifier to check that all memory accesses are within the sandbox. Instead of relying on a posteriori verification, we design, implement and prove correct a program instrumentation phase as part of the formally verified compiler CompCert that enforces a sandboxing security property a priori . This eliminates the need for a binary verifier and, instead, leverages the soundness proof of the compiler to prove the security of the sandboxing transformation. The technical contributions are a novel sandboxing transformation that has a well-defined C semantics and which supports arbitrary function pointers, and a formally verified C compiler that implements SFI. Experiments show that our formally verified technique is a competitive way of implementing SFI.},

Three of the applications stored sensitive information, like wallet private keys, insecurely and one was able to be decrypted with some effort.

A common procedure (especially for data scientists) is to extract features such as permissions, APIs or strings which can then be analyzed. Current state of the art tools have three major issues: (1) a single tool cannot extract all the significant features used by scientists and practitioners (2) Current tools are not designed to be extensible and (3) Existing parsers can be timely as they are not runtime efficient or scalable. Therefore, this work presents AndroParse which is an open-source Android parser written in Golang that currently extracts the four most common features: Permissions, APIs, Strings and Intents. AndroParse outputs JSON files as they can easily be used by most major programming languages. Constructing the parser allowed us to create an extensive feature dataset which can be accessed by our independent REST API.

A disclosure mechanism should be simple to deploy, resulting in few false positives and few false negatives. In this paper we present Tainer, an automatic dynamic taint analysis framework to detect and generate exploits for sanitization based vulnerabilities for Java web applications. Particularly, our method is based on tracking the flow of taint information from untrusted input the application sensitive methods (such as console, file, network, database or another program).

  abstract = {More than two decades after the first stack smashing attacks, memory corruption vulnerabilities utilizing stack anomalies are still prevalent and play an important role in practice. Among such vulnerabilities, uninitialized variables play an exceptional role due to their unpleasant property of unpredictability: as compilers are tailored to operate fast, costly interprocedural analysis procedures are not used in practice to detect such vulnerabilities. As a result, complex relationships that expose uninitialized memory reads remain undiscovered in binary code. Recent vulnerability reports show the versatility on how uninitialized memory reads are utilized in practice, especially for memory disclosure and code execution. Research in recent years proposed detection and prevention techniques tailored to source code. To date, however, there has not been much attention for these types of software bugs within binary executables. In this paper, we present a static analysis framework to find uninitialized variables in binary executables. We developed methods to lift the binaries into a knowledge representation which builds the base for specifically crafted algorithms to detect uninitialized reads. Our prototype implementation is capable of detecting uninitialized memory errors in complex binaries such as web browsers and OS kernels, and we detected 7 novel bugs.},

  abstract = {Android, the most popular mobile operating system, with billions of active users and more than 2 million apps, has motivated advertisers, hackers, fraudsters and cyber-criminals to develop malware of all types for it. In recent years, extensive research has been conducted on malware analysis and detection for Android devices, even though Android has already implemented various security mechanisms to deal with the problem. In this paper, we developed a consortium blockchain network to evaluate various machine learning models for a given malware dataset. A reward is offered using smart contracts as an incentive to the competitors for their work by allowing them to submit solutions through training with selected machine learning models in a secure and trustworthy manner. The analysis of datasets by competitors helps various organizations in the network to enhance or boost their current malware detection or defense tools. The decentralized network provides transparency, enhances security and reduces the cost in managing all relevant data by eliminating third parties. We used DREBIN dataset in the developed framework for initial experiments and the encouraging results are presented.},

  abstract = {In the recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the number of files submitted to anti-virus companies for analysis. It has become very difficult to analyse the functionality of each file manually. Malware developers have been highly successful in evading signature-based detection techniques. Most of the prevailing static analysis techniques involve a tool to parse the executable, and extract features or signatures. Most of the dynamic analysis techniques involve the binary file to be run in a sand-boxed environment to examine its behaviour. This can be easily thwarted by hiding the malicious activities of the file if it is being run inside a virtual environment. Hence, there has been a need to explore new approaches to overcome the limitations of static or dynamic analysis such as time intensity, resource consumption, scalability. In this paper, we have explored a new technique to represent malware as images. We have used 37, 374 samples belonging to 22 families and then applied deep neural network architectures such as ResNet-50 architecture including a dense Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images. By converting the executable into an image representation, we have made our analysis process free from the problems faced by standard static and dynamic analyses. With our models, we have been able to get an accuracy of 98.98\%, and 99.40\% in classifying malware samples by using deep CNN, and ResNet-50 respectively on our dataset. In this paper, we have also compared the results of our proposed model on our collected dataset with the results obtained on publically available datasets like Malimg having 9,339 samples belonging to 25 families. We also present our findings on the limitation of this method through experimentation on packed and previously unseen classes of malware.},

It is, however, inherently hard due to the low level of abstraction involved; instead of verifying typed and structured source code, one has to verify machine code or reconstructed assembly. This paper presents a semi-automated methodology for formally verifying memory preservation, as well as register preservation, over disassembled binaries. The methodology is based on formal symbolic execution and Floyd-style verification. We show that the methodology is compositional on the function level, which is crucial for scalability. The methodology works for loops, recursion, and both optimized and non-optimized code. It can be used to expose preconditions required for non-exceptional behavior. We demonstrate applicability by verifying a set of functions from the HermitCore unikernel library.},

Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the protection of APK code. But with the continuous evolution of the Android system compilation mode, the protection of APK code has encountered more and more difficulties. Main code protection schemes are just for applications based on Interpretation or AOT (Ahead of Time) compilation mode, but the new hybrid compilation mode used in Android 8.0 makes it difficult for the code protection schemes to protect APK code. So we refer to the Android system source code to study the hybrid compilation process of Android 8.0. By analyzing the loading, compiling and executing flow of programs in Android 8.0, we find a way to control the compilation mode. Combined with inline hook technology, our code protection scheme effectively avoids the impact of the complicated hybrid compilation mode, restores the instructions successfully and achieves the purpose of protecting APK code.},

  abstract = {With the widespread use of smartphones, many malware attacks such as user’s private information is stolen or leaking have been proposed. Furthermore, the hacker can manipulate these smartphones to become a member of malicious attackers. Therefore, how to detect the malware application has become one of the most important issues. Until now, two detection methods (static analysis and dynamic analysis) were discussed. For the static analysis view, it observes the source code to determine whether it is a malware application. However, the source code will be processed (such as packing or confusion) before it is shared. Therefore, the static analysis method is not able to detect it because we cannot get the recover code correctly and completely. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a new detection method based on CNN (convolutional neural network) will be proposed in this paper. The major contribution of our proposed scheme is that we can decompress the APK (Android application package) file directly, to obtain the classes.dex file and then uses the training detection model to determine whether the input classes.dex is malicious code or not. Finally, according to the experiment results, our proposed scheme is available for all APKs with an accuracy rate is 94\%.},

Most researchers have only considered a single permission or API feature, and did not consider associations and patterns inside the permission or API features.

However, existing studies on software defect prediction are mostly limited to the source code. Defect prediction for Android binary executables (called apks) has never been explored in previous studies. In this paper, we propose an explorative study of defect prediction in Android apks. We first propose smali2vec, a new approach to generate features that capture the characteristics of smali (decompiled files of apks) files in apks. Smali2vec extracts both token and semantic features of the defective files in apks and such comprehensive features are needed for building accurate prediction models. Then we leverage deep neural network (DNN), which is one of the most common architecture of deep learning networks, to train and build the defect prediction model in order to achieve accuracy. We apply our defect prediction model to more than 90,000 smali files from 50 Android apks and the results show that our model could achieve an AUC (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 85.98\% and it is capable of predicting defects in apks. Furthermore, the DNN is proved to have a better performance than the traditional shallow machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine and naive bayes) used in previous studies. The model has been used in our practical work and helped locate many defective files in apks.},

Often, the code is not copied as it is and it may be modified for various purposes; e.g. refactoring, bug fixing, or even software plagiarism. These code modifications could affect the performance of code similarity analysers including code clone and plagiarism detectors to some certain degree. We are interested in two types of code modification in this study: pervasive modifications, i.e. transformations that may have a global effect, and local modifications, i.e. code changes that are contained in a single method or code block. We evaluate 30 code similarity detection techniques and tools using five experimental scenarios for Java source code. These are (1) pervasively modified code, created with tools for source code and bytecode obfuscation, and boiler-plate code, (2) source code normalisation through compilation and decompilation using different decompilers, (3) reuse of optimal configurations over different data sets, (4) tool evaluation using ranked-based measures, and (5) local + global code modifications. Our experimental results show that in the presence of pervasive modifications, some of the general textual similarity measures can offer similar performance to specialised code similarity tools, whilst in the presence of boiler-plate code, highly specialised source code similarity detection techniques and tools outperform textual similarity measures. Our study strongly validates the use of compilation/decompilation as a normalisation technique. Its use reduced false classifications to zero for three of the tools. Moreover, we demonstrate that optimal configurations are very sensitive to a specific data set. After directly applying optimal configurations derived from one data set to another, the tools perform poorly on the new data set. The code similarity analysers are thoroughly evaluated not only based on several well-known pair-based and query-based error measures but also on each specific type of pervasive code modification. This broad, thorough study is the largest in existence and potentially an invaluable guide for future users of similarity detection in source code.},

It typically needs intensive manual efforts. More importantly, users may specify sensitive information only through an implicit manner. Existing research efforts on identifying sensitive data from its descriptive texts focus on keyword/phrase searching. These approaches can have high false positives/negatives as they do not consider the semantics of the descriptions. In this paper, we propose S3 , an automated approach to identify sensitive data based on users’ implicit specifications. Our approach considers semantic, syntactic and lexical information comprehensively, aiming to identify sensitive data by the semantics of its descriptive texts. We introduce the notion concept space to represent the user’s notion of privacy, by which our approach can support flexible user requirements in defining sensitive data. Our approach is able to learn users’ preferences from readable concepts initially provided by users, and automatically identify related sensitive data. We evaluate our approach on over 18,000 top popular applications from Google Play Store. S3 achieves an average precision of 89.2\%, and average recall 95.8\% in identifying sensitive data.},

Effective prevention and control of malicious applications concern the healthy development of the mobile Internet industry and the vital interests of the vast number of mobile terminal users. However, due to many new characteristics of mobile intelligent terminals, such as storing personal privacy data, the traditional software security technology cannot be applied to mobile applications directly. Therefore, the security detection for mobile applications is of great significance. In this paper, we proposed a simple-Dalvik intermediate language-based method to detect the malicious mobile applications. In this method, we first reduce the 218 instructions in the Dalvik instruction set to a simpler set, SDIL, through simplification and optimization. By using SDIL, we can effectively refine the instruction features and maintain the control relationships of the source program. After that, we use an improved MOSS algorithm to detect malicious mobile applications. Our experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper greatly improves the detection efficiency of malicious mobile applications and maintains good accuracy.},

  abstract = {Android as a widest used operating system for smartphones and mobile devices uses permissions to restrict malicious applications (apps). However, malware developers use various social engineering methods to entice users for installing malwares after granting critical permissions by users. Therefore, it is essential to estimate security risks of untrusted Android apps to help users for making better decisions regarding app selection and installation. In this paper, the concept of criticality for Android permissions is precisely defined according to the abuse of permissions by known malwares and their legal usage by useful apps. Based on this definition and analyzing requested permissions of large numbers of malwares and benign apps, a new criterion is proposed to measure the security risks of the apps. This measure benefits from the concepts of entropy and information gain of permissions regarding separating malwares from benign apps. In this criterion, more informative permissions have higher impacts on the computed risk values. In order to evaluate the proposed criterion, two new datasets of recent malicious and non-malicious Android apps have been constructed and analyzed against existing ones. This analysis shows that permission usage patterns of Android apps are changed over the time. Empirical evaluations on recent and previous malwares and benign apps reveal the superiority of the proposed criterion with respect to previously proposed ones in terms of assigning larger risk values to malwares.},

  abstract = {Abstract Code protection technologies require anti reverse engineering transformations to obfuscate programs in such a way that tools and methods for program analysis become ineffective. We introduce the concept of model deformation inducing an effective code obfuscation against attacks performed by abstract model checking. This means complicating the model in such a way a high number of spurious traces are generated in any formal verification of the property to disclose about the system under attack.We transform the program model in order to make the removal of spurious counterexamples by abstraction refinement maximally inefficient. Because our approach is intended to defeat the fundamental abstraction refinement strategy, we are independent from the specific attack carried out by abstract model checking. A measure of the quality of the obfuscation obtained by model deformation is given together with a corresponding best obfuscation strategy for abstract model checking based on partition refinement.},

  abstract = {Researchers often analyze several revisions of a software project to obtain historical data about its evolution. For example, they statically analyze the source code and monitor the evolution of certain metrics over multiple revisions. The time and resource requirements for running these analyses often make it necessary to limit the number of analyzed revisions, e.g., by only selecting major revisions or by using a coarse-grained sampling strategy, which could remove significant details of the evolution. Most existing analysis techniques are not designed for the analysis of multi-revision artifacts and they treat each revision individually. However, the actual difference between two subsequent revisions is typically very small. Thus, tools tailored for the analysis of multiple revisions should only analyze these differences, thereby preventing re-computation and storage of redundant data, improving scalability and enabling the study of a larger number of revisions. In this work, we propose the Lean Language-Independent Software Analyzer (LISA), a generic framework for representing and analyzing multi-revisioned software artifacts. It employs a redundancy-free, multi-revision representation for artifacts and avoids re-computation by only analyzing changed artifact fragments across thousands of revisions. The evaluation of our approach consists of measuring the effect of each individual technique incorporated, an in-depth study of LISA resource requirements and a large-scale analysis over 7 million program revisions of 4,000 software projects written in four languages. We show that the time and space requirements for multi-revision analyses can be reduced by multiple orders of magnitude, when compared to traditional, sequential approaches.},

  abstract = {The domination of the Android operating system in the market share of smart terminals has engendered increasing threats of malicious applications (apps). Research on Android malware detection has received considerable attention in academia and the industry. In particular, studies on malware families have been beneficial to malware detection and behavior analysis. However, identifying the characteristics of malware families and the features that can describe a particular family have been less frequently discussed in existing work. In this paper, we are motivated to explore the key features that can classify and describe the behaviors of Android malware families to enable fingerprinting the malware families with these features. We present a framework for signature-based key feature construction. In addition, we propose a frequency-based feature elimination algorithm to select the key features. Finally, we construct the fingerprints of ten malware families, including twenty key features in three categories. Results of extensive experiments using Support Vector Machine demonstrate that the malware family classification achieves an accuracy of 92\% to 99\%. The typical behaviors of malware families are analyzed based on the selected key features. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented algorithm and fingerprinting method.},

  abstract = {Third-party IME (Input Method Editor) apps are often the preference means of interaction for Android users’ input. In this paper, we first discuss the insecurity of IME apps, including the Potentially Harmful Apps (PHAs) and malicious IME apps, which may leak users’ sensitive keystrokes. The current defense system, such as I-BOX, is vulnerable to the prefix substitution attack and the colluding attack due to the post-IME nature. We provide a deeper understanding that all the designs with the post-IME nature are subject to the prefix-substitution and colluding attacks. To remedy the above post-IME system’s flaws, we propose a new idea, pre-IME, which guarantees that “Is this touch event a sensitive keystroke?” analysis will always access user touch events prior to the execution of any IME app code. We design an innovative TrustZone-based framework named IM-Visor which has the pre-IME nature. Specifically, IM-Visor creates the isolation environment named STIE as soon as a user intends to type on a soft keyboard, then the STIE intercepts,Android event sub translates and analyzes the user’s touch input. If the input is sensitive, the translation of keystrokes will be delivered to user apps through a trusted path. Otherwise, IM-Visor replays non-sensitive keystroke touch events for IME apps or replays non-keystroke touch events for other apps. A prototype of IM-Visor has been implemented and tested with several most popular IMEs. The experimental results show that IM-Visor has small runtime overheads.},

  abstract = {Machine learning is a popular method of learning functions from data to represent and to classify sensor inputs, multimedia, emails, and calendar events. Smartphone applications have been integrating more and more intelligence in the form of machine learning. Machine learning functionality now appears on most smartphones as voice recognition, spell checking, word disambiguation, face recognition, translation, spatial reasoning, and even natural language summarization. Excited app developers who want to use machine learning on mobile devices face one serious constraint that they did not face on desktop computers or cloud virtual machines: the end-user’s mobile device has limited battery life, thus computationally intensive tasks can harm end users’ phone availability by draining batteries of their stored energy. Currently, there are few guidelines for developers who want to employ machine learning on mobile devices yet are concerned about software energy consumption of their applications. In this paper, we combine empirical measurements of different machine learning algorithm implementations with complexity theory to provide concrete and theoretically grounded recommendations to developers who want to employ machine learning on smartphones. We conclude that some implementations of algorithms, such as J48, MLP, and SMO, do generally perform better than others in terms of energy consumption and accuracy, and that energy consumption is well-correlated to algorithmic complexity. However, to achieve optimal results a developer must consider their specific application as many factors — dataset size, number of data attributes, whether the model will require updating, etc. — affect which machine learning algorithm and implementation will provide the best results.},

  abstract = {When critical assets or functionalities are included in a piece of software accessible to the end users, code protections are used to hinder or delay the extraction or manipulation of such critical assets. The process and strategy followed by hackers to understand and tamper with protected software might differ from program understanding for benign purposes. Knowledge of the actual hacker behaviours while performing real attack tasks can inform better ways to protect the software and can provide more realistic assumptions to the developers, evaluators, and users of software protections. Within Aspire, a software protection research project funded by the EU under framework programme FP7, we have conducted three industrial case studies with the involvement of professional penetration testers and a public challenge consisting of eight attack tasks with open participation. We have applied a systematic qualitative analysis methodology to the hackers’ reports relative to the industrial case studies and the public challenge. The qualitative analysis resulted in 459 and 265 annotations added respectively to the industrial and to the public challenge reports. Based on these annotations we built a taxonomy consisting of 169 concepts. They address the hacker activities related to (i) understanding code; (ii) defining the attack strategy; (iii) selecting and customizing the tools; and (iv) defeating the protections. While there are many commonalities between professional hackers and practitioners, we could spot many fundamental differences. For instance, while industrial professional hackers aim at elaborating automated and reproducible deterministic attacks, practitioners prefer to minimize the effort and try many different manual tasks. This analysis allowed us to distill a number of new research directions and potential improvements for protection techniques. In particular, considering the critical role of analysis tools, protection techniques should explicitly attack them, by exploiting analysis problems and complexity aspects that available automated techniques are bad at addressing.},

  abstract = {Behavior-based malware analysis is an important technique for automatically analyzing and detecting malware, and it has received considerable attention from both academic and industrial communities. By considering how malware behaves, we can tackle the malware obfuscation problem, which cannot be processed by traditional static analysis approaches, and we can also derive the as-built behavior specifications and cover the entire behavior space of the malware samples. Although there have been several works focusing on malware behavior analysis, such research is far from mature, and no overviews have been put forward to date to investigate current developments and challenges. In this paper, we conduct a survey on malware behavior description and analysis considering three aspects: malware behavior description, behavior analysis methods, and visualization techniques. First, existing behavior data types and emerging techniques for malware behavior description are explored, especially the goals, principles, characteristics, and classifications of behavior analysis techniques proposed in the existing approaches. Second, the inadequacies and challenges in malware behavior analysis are summarized from different perspectives. Finally, several possible directions are discussed for future research.},

The research community is using it for evaluation and comparison of their algorithms. We discovered that 49.35\% of samples in this dataset has at least one other sample that is a repackaged version containing exactly the same sequence of opcode. The only differences between the original malware and the duplicated ones, in all cases, are the resources embedded and some strings in the code. For assessing the performance of malware detectors or classifiers, a part of the dataset is used for this purpose. So a major part of the testing set end up beeing the same samples that have been used in the training set. This situation can lead us, the research community, to overrate the performance of algorithms we are designing. In the worst case, it leads us to wrong conclusions and wrong directions for future research. Then we conduct an experiment where we test several classification algorithms on the Drebin dataset with and without the duplicates. Our results show that depending on the classifier the full dataset can lead from moderately (124\%) to strongly (172\%) underrated inaccuracy , and the order of performance of the algorithms is modified. Finally we provide the list of unique malware samples from the Drebin dataset , available on Github .},

It can resist simple identifier renaming. Furthermore, this paper proposes an abnormal library detection method that it utilizes frequent pattern to measure the normal degree of library instances. Comparing with existing methods, the abnormal library detection method can not rely on original library files. A ground truth dataset that it consists of 177 malicious applications with abnormal library instance and 81,317 benign apps is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches.

The biggest threat to a smart phone user is the loss of his/her personal information by an attacker. To protect a user’s information from these threats, an attack detection application for the Android OS is proposed and developed, in which the detection system is comprised of two phases: the mobile detection system pre-phase and post-phase. The pre-phase includes the steps performed before an attack occurs for the comparison and analysis step of the post-phase, and the post-phase includes the steps performed to detect malware using an attack tree with level assignments from the post-phase. Three classes, interception, modification, and system damage, are defined to classify attacks to determine the attacker’s purpose. When an attack occurs, the application can recognize what kind of route the mobile attack goes through by comparing and analyzing the attack tree from the pre-phase and current attack data in the post-phase. Attack trees are used to easily extract attack scenarios and determine when an attack is occurring. We expect that using the proposed application will protect a user’s personal information on a mobile system.},

Then, through the analysis of the category and appearance frequency of each feature, we extract some key features for malware detection so as to reduce the dimensionality of feature vector. Finally, we propose two methods based on the combination of clustering and classification to distinguish malicious and benign applications. One is mixed clustering, which clusters the malicious and benign samples together; the other is separate clustering, which clusters the malicious and benign samples separately. We choose to use the K-mean clustering algorithm and the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification algorithm. Evaluation results show that our methods outperform the common SVM-based method in detection accuracy, and outperform the KNN-based method in prediction time. In addition, the detection ability for unknown malware families of our methods is also better than that of the SVM-based method.},

To evaluate the applicability of our solution, we conducted a manual and automated inspection of security-related Android applications that process user-entered secrets.

Thirdly, we investigated \\(\\sim \\) 30,000 apps and found that roughly 19\% of these apps is using one of the these libraries.

  abstract = {New graphics APIs require users to implement a lot of needed functionality, such as memory management, by themselves. In this paper we present an abstraction layer build on top of such API, in our case the Vulkan API, for purpose of off-screen rendering of large data. We also present a use case for such abstraction layer implementation – a remote rendering system for simple Path Tracing accessible through web-based client-side application. The preliminary evaluation results show that implementation of simple Path Tracer is significantly faster then comparable implementation in OpenCL. In conclusion we also present possible extension and improvements of the developed abstraction layer.},

In recent years, researchers have proposed a myriad of techniques and tools to detect such issues automatically. However, it is unclear how these approaches perform compared to each other. The tools are often no longer available, thus comparing different approaches is almost infeasible. In this work, we propose an approach to execute static analysis tools and collect their output to obtain unified reports in a common format. We review the current state-of-the-art in Android data leak detection tools, and from a list of 87 approaches, of which we were able to obtain and execute five. We compare these using a set of known vulnerabilities and discuss the overall performance of the tools. We further present an approach to compare security analysis tools by normalising their interfaces, which simplifies result reproduction and extension.},

Lifters thus enable a host of static and dynamic analyses for such low-level code. However, writing a lifter is a tedious manual process which must be repeated for every architecture an analysis aims to support. We introduce cross-architecture lifter synthesis, a novel approach that automatically synthesizes lifters for previously unsupported architectures. Our insight is that lifter synthesis can be bootstrapped with existing IR sketches that exploit the shared semantic properties of heterogeneous architecture instruction sets. We show that our approach automates a significant amount of translation effort for a previously unsupported instruction set, and that it enables discovery of new bugs on new architecture targets through reuse of an existing IR-based analysis.},

Recently, various machine learning approaches have been proposed for detecting malware. However, either they focused on behaviour information, leaving the data information out of consideration, or they did not consider too much about the new malware with different behaviours or new malware versions obtained by obfuscation techniques. In this paper, we propose an effective approach for malware detection using machine learning. Different from most existing work, we take into account not only the behaviour information but also the data information, namely, the opcodes, data types and system libraries used in executables. We employ various machine learning methods in our implementation. Several experiments are conducted to evaluate our approach. The results show that (1) the classifier trained by Random Forest performs best with the accuracy 0.9788 and the AUC 0.9959; (2) all the features (including data types) are effective for malware detection; (3) our classifier is capable of detecting some fresh malware; (4) our classifier has a resistance to some obfuscation techniques.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, handheld devices have become popular but volume of malwares on mobile platform has also grown rapidly. To detect mobile malware, static approaches and dynamic approaches are two common ways used to analyze suspicious applications. Dynamic approaches detect malware base on the actual behaviors of applications, but how to trigger malicious behavior and the efficient of dynamic approaches are the difficulties of this kind of approaches. Due to the limited resource of mobile devices, static analysis approach is the practicable way to detect malwares on mobile device. Anti-virus software is the typical paradigm of static analysis approach. However, the effectiveness of Anti-virus software rely on its signatures. How to find an efficient and automatic way to build thread pattern of mobile malware is a critical issue to detect new or zero-day malware. In this paper, a detect mechanism based on data flow is proposed. The proposed system analyzes the function calls and the data flow to identify malicious behaviors in Android mobile devices. Machine learning approach is used to build threat patterns automatically within a great volume of applications. The experimental result shows that the proposed system could detect malware with high accuracy and low false positive rate.},

Currently, many solutions for application copyright protection apply overload methods, assuming the availability of source code, which could be impractical for a large scale application protection.

  abstract = {The use of native code (ARM binary code) libraries in Android apps greatly promotes the execution performance of frequently used algorithms. Nonetheless, it increases the complexity of app assessment since the binary code analysis is often sophisticated and time-consuming. As a result, many defects still exist in native code libraries and potentially threat the security of users. To assess the native code libraries, current researches mainly focus on the API invoking correctness and less dive into the details of code. Hence, flaws may hide in internal implementation when the analysis of API does not discover them effectively. The assessment of native code requires a more detailed code comprehension process to pinpoint flaws. In response, we design and implement NativeSpeaker , an Android native code analysis system to assess native code libraries. NativeSpeaker provides not only the capability of recognizing certain pattern related to security flaws, but also the functionality of discovering and comparing native code libraries among a large-scale collection of apps from non-official Android markets. With the help of NativeSpeaker , we analyzed 20,353 dynamic libraries (.so) collected from 20,000 apps in non-official Android markets. Particularly, our assessment focuses on searching crypto misuse related insecure code pattern in those libraries. The analyzing results show even for those most frequently used (top 1\%) native code libraries, one third of them contain at least one misuse. Furthermore, our observation indicates the misuse of crypto is often related to insecure data communication: about 25\% most frequently used native code libraries suffer from this flaw. Our conducted analysis revealed the necessity of in-depth security assessment against popular native code libraries, and proved the effectiveness of the designed NativeSpeaker system.},

Our evaluation demonstrated that BinAuthor outperforms existing methods in several respects. First, when tested on large datasets extracted from selected open-source C/C++ projects in GitHub, Google Code Jam events, and Planet Source Code contests, it successfully attributed a larger number of authors with a significantly higher accuracy: around \\(90\\\%\\) when the number of authors is 1000.

  abstract = {Android API is evolving continuously, including API updates, deletion, addition and changes. Unfortunately, we find that the distributed Android applications (apps) often fail to keep pace with the API evolution. Specifically, the apps usually involve the APIs that are out of date, which potentially cause the apps or Android system to behave abnormally, leak sensitive information or crash down. We call this issue that making the Android phones unreliable as API misuse. To investigate the universality of this issue and detect the defective apps in the wild, we propose an automated framework MAD-API that consists of a detection method that identifies API misuses in apps and a recommendation method to trace the latest API status and correct the misuses. We implement MAD-API based on 13 Android versions, and evaluate it with the top 10,000 Android apps. According to the evaluation, 93.13\% of the evaluated apps suffer from API misuse problems, and the total number of API misuses is 1,241,831. In addition, apps with larger size have more API misuses. Worst of all, some APIs are misused all the time. The results indicate that (1) the API misuse issue widely exists in distributed apps, (2) MAD-API is able to detect API misuses in Android apps effectively, and (3) MAD-API also help developers trace the defective APIs in their distributed apps conveniently and correct them immediately.},

  abstract = {Obfuscation is an important technique to protect software from adversary analysis. Control flow obfuscation effectively prevents attackers from understanding the program structure, hence impeding a broad set of reverse engineering efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel control flow obfuscation method which employs Turing machines to simulate the computation of branch conditions. By weaving the original program with Turing machine components, program control flow graph and call graph can become much more complicated. In addition, due to the runtime computation complexity of a Turing machine, program execution flow would be highly obfuscated and become resilient to advanced reverse engineering approaches via symbolic execution and concolic testing. We have implemented a prototype tool for Turing obfuscation. Comparing with previous work, our control flow obfuscation technique delivers three distinct advantages. (1) Complexity: the complicated structure of a Turing machine makes it difficult for attackers to understand the program control flow. (2) Universality: Turing machines can encode any computation and hence applicable to obfuscate any program component. (3) Resiliency: Turing machine brings in complex execution model, which is shown to withstand automated reverse engineering efforts. Our evaluation obfuscates control flow predicates of two widely-used applications, and the experimental results show that the proposed technique can obfuscate programs in stealth with good performance and robustness.},

  abstract = {Program code is a valuable asset to its owner. Due to the easy-to-reverse nature of Java, code protection for Android apps is of particular importance. To this end, code obfuscation is widely utilized by both legitimate app developers and malware authors, which complicates the representation of source code or machine code in order to hinder the manual investigation and code analysis. Despite many previous studies focusing on the obfuscation techniques, however, our knowledge of how obfuscation is applied by real-world developers is still limited. In this paper, we seek to better understand Android obfuscation and depict a holistic view of the usage of obfuscation through a large-scale investigation in the wild. In particular, we focus on three popular obfuscation approaches: identifier renaming, string encryption and Java reflection. To obtain the meaningful statistical results, we designed efficient and lightweight detection models for each obfuscation technique and applied them to our massive APK datasets (collected from Google Play, multiple third-party markets, and malware databases). We have learned several interesting facts from the result. For example, more apps on third-party markets than malware use identifier renaming, and malware authors use string encryption more frequently. We are also interested in the explanation of each finding. Therefore we carry out in-depth code analysis on some Android apps after sampling. We believe our study will help developers select the most suitable obfuscation approach, and in the meantime help researchers improve code analysis systems in the right direction.},

  abstract = {Validation of Bitcoin transactions rely upon the successful execution of scripts written in a simple and effective, non-Turing-complete by design language, simply called script . This makes the validation of closed scripts, i.e. those associated to actual transactions and bearing full information, straightforward. Here we address the problem of validating open scripts, i.e. we address the validation of redeeming scripts against the whole set of possible inputs, i.e. under which general conditions can Bitcoins be redeemed? Even if likely not one of the most complex languages and demanding verification problems, we advocate the merit of formal verification for the Bitcoin validation framework. We propose a symbolic verification theory for open script , a verifier tool-kit, and illustrate examples of use on Bitcoin transactions. Contributions include (1) a formalisation of (a fragment of script ) the language; (2) a novel symbolic approach to script verification, suitable, e.g. for the verification of newly defined and non-standard payment schemes; and (3) building blocks for a larger verification theory for the developing area of Bitcoin smart contracts. The verification of smart contracts, i.e. agreements built as transaction-based protocols, is currently a problem that is difficult to formalise and computationally demanding.},

  abstract = {Android malware can pose serious security threat to the mobile users. With the rapid growth in malware programs, categorical isolation of malware is no longer satisfactory for security risk management. It is more pragmatic to focus the limited resources on identifying the small fraction of malware programs of high security impact. In this paper, we define a new research issue of measuring and predicting the impact of the detected Android malware. To address this issue, we first propose two metrics to isolate the high impact Android malware programs from the low impact ones. With the proposed metrics, we created a new research dataset including high impact and low impact Android malware samples. The dataset allows us to empirically discover the driving factors for the high malware impact. To characterize the differences between high impact and low impact Android malware, we leverage features from two sources available in every Android application. (1) the readily available AndroidManifest.xml file and (2) the disassembled code from the compiled binary. From these characteristics, we trained a highly accurate classifier to identify high impact Android malware. The experimental results show that our proposed method is feasible and has great potential in predicting the impact of Android malware in general.},

  abstract = {At present, smart watches are loved by users because of their convenience, high efficiency, aesthetics and practicality. Smart watches interconnect with matching smart phones instead of working individually to achieve their maximum functionality. The wireless network interface serves as an interconnection bridge between smart watches and smart phones to realize application data exchange, which introduces a risk to personal security and privacy. Therefore, improving Wi-Fi firmware security is very important. To boost the security of the wearable device, we propose a security upgrade and replacement scheme of the Wi-Fi firmware by expanding the security function of the Wi-Fi watch firmware and a reliable replacement method, which can effectively improve the security of the smart watch. We implement firmware switching and recovery at the kernel level. Data encryption module is added to the firmware to enhance data interaction security. Experiments show that our approach improves robustness of Wi-Fi firmware upgrade and data interaction security while guarantees the ordinary functionality of the Wi-Fi module.},

  abstract = {With the drastic increase of smartphone adoption, malware attacks on smartphones have emerged as serious privacy and security threat. Kaspersky Labs detected and intercepted a total of 5,730,916 malicious installation packages in 2017. To curb this problem, researchers and various security laboratories have developed numerous malware analysis models. In Android based smartphones, permissions have been an inherent part of such models. Permission request patterns can be used to detect behavior of different applications. As applications with similar functionalities should use permission requests in similar ways, they can be used to distinguish different types of apps. However, when analysis models are trained on permission vectors extracted from a mixture of applications without maintaining any differences that naturally exist among different application categories, aggregated results can miss details and this can result in errors. In this paper, we propose a permission analysis model for android applications which includes a classification module and a malware detection module based on application permission vectors to deal with Android malware detection problem. We mine the benign application permission vector set into 32 categories by mining the similarity of permission vectors, and input malicious application permission vector sets into the model to obtain class labels, then extract sensitive features from different classes. Finally, sensitive features of each class are respectively input into the machine learning algorithm to obtain a classification model of malicious and benign applications. Our experimental results show that our model can achieve 93.66\% accuracy of detecting malware instances.},

  abstract = {Free VPN apps have gained popularity among millions of users due to their convenience, and have been massively used for accessing blocked sites and preventing network eavesdropping. As a popular open-source VPN solution, OpenVPN is widely used by developers to implement their own VPN services. Despite the prevalence of OpenVPN, it can be insecurely customized and deployed by developers in lack of security guide. In this paper, we perform a systematic security analysis of 84 popular OpenVPN-based apps on the Google Play store. We analyze the deployment security of OpenVPN on Android from the aspects of client profile, code implementation, and permission management. Our experiment reveals three types of misconfigurations that exist in several apps: insecure customized protocols, weak authentication at the client side, and incorrect file permissions on Android. The misconfigurations found by us can lead to some serious attacks, such as VPN traffic decryption and Man-in-the-Middle attacks, endangering millions of users’ privacy. Our work shows that, although OpenVPN protocol itself has withstood security analysis, insecure custom modification and configuration can still compromise the security of VPN apps. We then discuss potential causes of these misconfigurations and make practical recommendations for developers to securely deploy OpenVPN services.},

  abstract = {In spite of numerous protection schemes, embedded systems are still faced with the danger of being attacked, especially at run time. Some ‘trusted’ programs may be attacked and then result in unintended behaviors, such as jumping to malicious code and leakage of sensitive data. Control flow authentication is one of efficient methods to protect the security of embedded system by ensuring system run along the designed control flow path. In this paper, we propose a new control flow authentication method to further improve the efficiency. A hardware monitor on chip is designed to help authenticate most control flow edges. And the control flow edges in loops are isolated and protected by self-validation software. This software method inserts assembly code upon every basic blocks in a loop to authenticate control flow edges by computing three validation variables. This loop isolation method helps hardware monitor to protect control flow edges which are repeatedly validated in loops to reduce validation times. With this combination, both performance and fault coverage rate have improved compared to traditional methods. To evaluate the performance, we built the system based on ARM v7-A architecture and simulated it using the cycle-accurate simulator GEM5 with SPEC2006 benchmarks.},

These hardware events, such as cache miss rate, branch misprediction rate, can be collected from the performance counter in the Intel CPUs. We train CNN with kinds of data sizes and kernel sizes, and evaluate the result by the area under a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC). The results show the proposed classification model can achieve AUC = 0.9973 in best case and the influence by the data size or kernel size is very little. Moreover, by comparison with other CNNs trained with software-based features, it is indicated that the proposed model has higher accuracy than the other ones.},

  abstract = {There is an ongoing need to computationally model human tactical decision-making, for example in military simulation, where the tactics of human combatants are modelled for the purposes of training and wargaming. These efforts have been dominated by AI-based approaches, such as production systems and the BDI (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) paradigm. Typically, the tactics are elicited from human domain experts, but due to the pre-conscious nature of much of human expertise, this is a non-trivial exercise. Knowledge elicitation methods developed for expert systems and ontologies have drawbacks when it comes to tactics modelling. Our objective has been to develop a new methodology that addresses the shortcomings, resulting in an approach that supports the efficient elicitation of tactical decision-making expertise and its mapping to a modelling representation that is intuitive to domain experts. Rather than treating knowledge elicitation, as a process of extracting knowledge from an expert, our approach views it as a collaborative modelling exercise with the expert involved in critiquing the models as they are constructed. To foster this collaborative process, we have employed an intuitive, diagrammatic representation for tactics. This paper describes TEM (Tactics Elicitation Methodology), a novel synthesis of knowledge elicitation with a BDI-based tactics modelling methodology, and outlines three case studies that provide initial support for our contention that it is an effective means of eliciting tactical decision-making knowledge in a form that can be readily understood by domain experts.},

This is a popular technique to build so-called hybrid applications, but it circumvents the usual security model of the browser: any malicious JavaScript code injected into the Webview gains access to the custom interface and can use it to manipulate the device or exfiltrate sensitive data. In this paper, we present an approach to systematically evaluate the possible impact of code injection attacks against Webviews using static information flow analysis. Our key idea is that we can make reasoning about JavaScript semantics unnecessary by instrumenting the application with a model of possible attacker behavior—the BabelView. We evaluate our approach on 25,000 apps from various Android marketplaces, finding 10,808 potential vulnerabilities in 4,997 apps. Taken together, the apps reported as problematic have over 3 billion installations worldwide.

A key technical insight behind the design of S ecurify is that whenever a smart contract violates a security property, it often also violates a simpler property that can be expressed on the contract’s data-flow graph. To leverage this insight, S ecurify symbolically encodes relevant control- and data-flow dependencies in stratified Datalog and uses scalable Datalog solvers to derive key semantic facts about the contract. Then, it inspects the inferred semantic facts to checks a set of compliance and violation patterns, which capture sufficient conditions for proving if a given security property holds or not.},

Several recent attacks have shown that the same malware infects different apps in the app market. Automated triaging by computing similarity of apps to known software components can help learn the evolution and propagation of malware. While the emphasis of existing research is on detecting repackaged apps, a similarity analysis system that can identify similar portions of code in dissimilar apps, is important. Only few public tools exist that furnish these details accurately. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept of an analysis system that compares Android apps using a technique that combines class and method features of an app. We use a two-step process that first compute similar classes and then compute similar methods of those classes. To identify similar classes, we propose a novel set of software birthmarks. We use Normalized Compression Distance to compute similar methods. The birthmarks are evaluated on a set of over 65,000 classes from 60 APKs. To evaluate the performance of our tool, we establish ground truth by manually reverse engineering each app. The proposed system is compared with Google’s androsim , the only open-source tool for similarity analysis that also uses NCD. Our approach shows an improvement in accuracy in the worst-case when comapred to androsim . Finally, we furnish a case-study of our system to detect fake and repackaged apps by analyzing 1470 Android apps from various sources.},

  abstract = {As Android operating system and applications on the device play important roles, the security requirements of Android applications increased as well. With the upgrade of Android system, Android runtime mode ( ART mode) has gradually become the mainstream architecture of the Android operating system. ART introduces several improvements in Android, but it also introduces new ways to enhance malicious activities. This paper proposed a confidential finer granularity protection scheme for application programs under ART mode of ROOT Android devices. Taking Java method as the protection granularity, the protection scheme increased the accuracy of protecting targets. In addition, the protection scheme provided a more thorough protection for applications by combining dynamic loading technology and encryption technology in ART mode, and improved the security of Android applications. Experiments showed that the proposed protection scheme is effective.},

  abstract = {In Android malware detection, fine-grained features can provide a more accurate description of the application’s behavior. Nonetheless fine-grained feature extraction has not been done perfectly, hence, invalid features will not only bring additional overhead but also reduce the detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose FGFDect, a malware classification model by mining Android applications for fine-grained features. Our work aims to handle two types of features that frequently appear in Android malware. One of them refers to the permissions that have been registered, but actually not been used. The other is the API called via the reflection mechanism. This information improves the precision of static analysis, which no longer need to make conservative assumptions about coarse-grained features. These two feature sets are fed into the machine learning algorithms to classify the app into benign or malware. FGFDect is evaluated on a large real-world data set consisting of 6400 malware apps and 4600 popular benign apps. Compared with those traditional approaches with coarse-grained features, extensive evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits an impressive detection accuracy of 96.7\% with the false positive rate of 0.7\%. In addition, the proposed approach complements existing permission-based approaches and API-based approaches.},

In addition, deciding sensitive data subjects to users’ requirements and the application context. Existing research efforts on identifying sensitive data from its descriptive texts focus on keyword/phrase searching.

In this paper, we propose S3, an automated approach to identify sensitive data based on user requirements. It considers semantic, syntactic and lexical information comprehensively, aiming to identify sensitive data by the semantics of its descriptive texts. We introduce the notion concept space to represent the user’s notion of privacy, by which our approach can support flexible user requirements in defining sensitive data. Our approach is able to learn users’ preferences from readable concepts initially provided by users, and automatically identify related sensitive data. We evaluate our approach on over 18,000 top popular applications from Google Play Store. S3 achieves an average precision of 89.2\%, and average recall 95.8\% in identifying sensitive data.},

In order to extract the exact used permissions in Android applications and third-party libraries, we propose a Dalvik register-based data flow analysis technique (DARFA) to get the parameter values of function parameters and fields. By leveraging DARFA, we design and implement PermHunter, a static analysis tool, to detect redundant permissions and probing permissions in Android apps and third-party libraries. We have evaluated PermHunter by analyzing 45 third-party libraries and 653 applications. These results indicate that nearly half of these third-party libraries have redundant permissions and probing permissions, and the proportions in Android applications are even higher.},

  abstract = {Android enables inter-app collaboration and function reusability by providing flexible Inter-Component Communication (ICC) across apps. Meanwhile, ICC introduces serious privacy leakage problems due to component hijacking, component injection, and application collusion attacks. Taint analysis technique has been adopted to successfully detect potential leakage between two mobile apps. However, it is still a challenge to efficiently perform large-scale leakage detection among a large set of apps, which may communicate through various ICC channels. In this paper, we develop a privacy leakage detection mechanism called LinkFlow to detect privacy leakage through ICC on a large set of apps. LinkFlow first leverages taint analysis technique to enumerate ICC links that may lead to privacy leakage in each individual app. Since most ICC links are normal, this step can dramatically reduce the number of risky ICC links for the next step analysis, where those ICC links are matched among leaky apps. We develop an algorithm to identify privacy leakage by analyzing ICC links and the associated permissions. We implement a LinkFlow prototype and evaluate its effectiveness with more than 4500 apps including 3014 benign apps from five apps marketplaces and 1500 malicious apps from two malware repositories. LinkFlow can successfully capture 6065 privacy leak paths among 530 apps. We also observe that more than 400 benign apps have vulnerabilities of privacy leakage in inter-app communications.},

  abstract = {Static binary analysis techniques are widely used to reconstruct the behavior and discover vulnerabilities in software when source code is not available. To avoid errors due to mis-interpreting data as machine instructions (or vice-versa), disassemblers and static analysis tools must precisely infer the boundaries between code and data. However, this information is often not readily available. Worse, compilers may embed small chunks of data inside the code section. Most state of the art approaches to separate code and data are rooted on recursive traversal disassembly, with severe limitations when dealing with indirect control instructions. We propose ELISA , a technique to separate code from data and ease the static analysis of executable files. ELISA leverages supervised sequential learning techniques to locate the code section(s) boundaries of header-less binary files, and to predict the instruction boundaries inside the identified code section. As a preliminary step, if the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of the binary is unknown, ELISA leverages a logistic regression model to identify the correct ISA from the file content. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on a dataset of executables compiled for different ISAs, and we show that our method is capable to identify code sections with a byte-level accuracy (F1 score) ranging from \\(98.13\\\%\\) to over \\(99.9\\\%\\) depending on the ISA. Fine-grained separation of code from embedded data on x86, x86-64 and ARM executables is accomplished with an accuracy of over \\(99.9\\\%\\) .},

  abstract = {Each new release of a mobile device operating system represents a renewed challenge for the forensics analyst. Even a small modification or fault correction of such basic software requires the revision of forensic tools and methods, frequently yielding to the development of new investigation tools and the consequent adaptation of methods. Forensic analysts then need to preserve each tool set and related methods and associate these sets to the specific mobile operating system release. This paper describes a case of transition consequent to the Android Runtime (ART) operating system release. The introduction of this system in the market required the development of a new forensic technique for analyzing ART memory objects using a volatile memory data extraction. Considering the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) source code, a method and associated software tools were developed allowing the location, extraction and interpretation of arbitrary ART memory instances with the respective object classes and their data properties. The proposed technique and tools were validated both for emulated and real devices, illustrating the difficulties related to the forensics analysis for the target system due to its particular implementations by multiple manufacturers of mobile devices.},

  abstract = {We propose HOBiT, a higher-order bidirectional programming language, in which users can write bidirectional programs in the familiar style of conventional functional programming, while enjoying the full expressiveness of lenses. A bidirectional transformation, or a lens, is a pair of mappings between source and view data objects, one in each direction. When the view is modified, the source is updated accordingly with respect to some laws—a pattern that is found in databases, model-driven development, compiler construction, and so on. The most common way of programming lenses is with lens combinators, which are lens-to-lens functions that compose simpler lenses to form more complex ones. Lens combinators preserve the bidirectionality of lenses and are expressive; but they compel programmers to a specialised point-free style—i.e., no naming of intermediate computation results—limiting the scalability of bidirectional programming. To address this issue, we propose a new bidirectional programming language HOBiT, in which lenses are represented as standard functions, and combinators are mapped to language constructs with binders. This design transforms bidirectional programming, enabling programmers to write bidirectional programs in a flexible functional style and at the same time access the full expressiveness of lenses. We formally define the syntax, type system, and the semantics of the language, and then show that programs in HOBiT satisfy bidirectionality. Additionally, we demonstrate HOBiT ’s programmability with examples.},

Lately, a plethora of related works rely on machine learning algorithms to classify whether an application is malware or not, using data that can be extracted from the application itself with high accuracy. However, different parameters can influence machine learning effectiveness. Thus, in this paper we focus on validating the efficiency of such approaches in detecting malware for Android platform, and identifying the optimal characteristics that should be consolidated in any similar approach. To do so, we built a machine learning solution based on features that can be extracted by static analysis of any Android application, such as activities, services, broadcasts, receivers, intent categories, APIs, and permissions. The extracted features are analyzed using statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms. The performance of different sets of features are investigated and compared. The analysis shows that under an optimal configuration an accuracy up to 97\% can be obtained.},

A PendingIntent holds a base intent to be executed by another application with the creator’s permissions and identity without the creator necessarily residing in memory. While PendingIntents are useful for many scenarios, e.g., for setting an alarm or getting notified at some point in the future, insecure usage of PendingIntents causes severe security threats in the form of denial-of-service, identity theft, and privilege escalation attacks. An attacker may gain up to SYSTEM privileges to perform the most sensitive operations, e.g., deleting user’s data on the device. However, so far no tool can detect these PendingIntent vulnerabilities. In this work we propose PIAnalyzer, a novel approach to analyze PendingIntent related vulnerabilities. We empirically evaluate PIAnalyzer on a set of 1000 randomly selected applications from the Google Play Store and find 1358 insecure usages of PendingIntents, including 70 severe vulnerabilities.

While dynamic and behavior based analysis aims to provide methods for effectively and efficiently extracting unique patterns of each malware family based on its behavior. To address some of those shortcomings, the study uses permission-based Android malware feature as a basis for malware detection using weighted based technique.},

However, compilers do not process the source programs directly; they instead work on control flow graphs (CFGs) of the programs. Unfortunately, there is little formalization of structured CFGs. This paper shows how the lack of formalization has led to varying interpretations of structured CFGs. The paper next presents new formalization of structured CFGs which eliminates the ambiguity. Structured CFGs gain importance as they ease compiler optimizations, decompilation, and help reduce the performance degradation caused by thread divergence on SIMD units. The paper elaborates on these benefits. It also shows that compilers, both front-ends and back-ends, may generate unstructured CFGs from structured program sources, which necessitates mechanisms to obtain structured CFGs from unstructured ones.},

Since Android has become the dominator of smartphone operating system market, the number of Android malicious applications are increasing rapidly as well, which attracts attention of malware attackers and researchers alike. Due to the endless evolution of the malware, it is critical to apply the analysis methods based on machine learning to detect malwares and stop them from leakaging our privacy information. In this paper, we propose a novel Android malware detection method based on binary texture feature recognition by Local Binary Pattern and Principal Component Analysis, which can visualize malware and detect malware accurately. Also, our method analyzes malware binary directly without any decompiler, sandbox or virtual machines, which avoid time and resource consumption caused by decompiler or monitor in this process. Experimentation on 5127 benigns and 5560 malwares shows that we obtain a detection accuracy of 90\%.},

  abstract = {Unauthorized code modification through reverse engineering is a major concern for Android application developers. Code reverse engineering is often used by adversaries to remove the copyright protection or advertisements from the app, or to inject malicious code into the program. By making the program difficult to analyze, code obfuscation is a potential solution to the problem. However, there is currently little work on applying code obfuscation to compiled Android bytecode. This paper presents DexPro , a novel bytecode level code obfuscation system for Android applications. Unlike prior approaches, our method performs on the Android Dex bytecode and does not require access to high-level program source or modification of the compiler or the VM. Our approach leverages the fact all except floating operands in Dex are stored in a 32-bit register to pack two 32-bit operands into a 64-bit operand. In this way, any attempt to decompile the bytecode will result in incorrect information. Meanwhile, our approach obfuscates the program control flow by inserting opaque predicates before the return instruction of a function call, which makes it harder for the attacker to trace calls to protected functions. Experimental results show that our approach can deter sophisticate reverse engineering and code analysis tools, and the overhead of runtime and memory footprint is comparable to existing code obfuscation methods.},

  abstract = {Energy bugs in Android apps are defects that can make Android systems waste much energy as a whole. Energy bugs detection in Android apps has become an important issue since smartphones usually operate on a limited amount of battery capacity and the existence of energy bugs may lead to serious drain in the battery power. This paper focuses on detecting two types of energy bugs, namely resource leak and layout defect, in Android apps. A resource leak is a particular type of energy wasting phenomena where an app does not release its acquired resources such as a sensor and GPS. A layout defect refers to a poor layout structure causing more energy consumption for measuring and drawing the layout. In this paper, we present a static analysis technique called SAAD, that can automatically detect energy bugs in a context-sensitive way. SAAD detects the energy bugs by taking an inter-procedural anaysis of an app. For resource leak analysis, SAAD decompiles APK file into Dalvik bytecodes files and then performs resource leak analysis by taking components call relationship analysis, inter-procedure and intra-procedure analysis. For detecting layout defect, SAAD firstly employs Lint to perform some traditional app analysis, then filters energy defects from reported issues. Our experimental result on 64 publicly-available Android apps shows that SAAD can detect energy bugs effectively. The accuracies of detecting resource leak and layout energy defect are \\(87.5\\\%\\) and \\(78.1\\\%\\) respectively.},

During memory forensics, kernel data structures are essential information. Existing solutions obtain this information by analyzing debugging information or by decompiling kernel functions to handle a certain range of versions. In this paper, by collecting and analyzing a number of Linux versions, we characterize the properties of different Linux kernel versions and how struct offsets change between versions. Furthermore, the Linux kernel provides over 10,000 configurable features, which leads to different kernel structure layouts for the same kernel version. To deal with this problem, we propose a method of identifying kernel struct layout based on brute-force matching. By examining the relationships between kernel structures, common features are extracted and exploited for brute-force matching. The experimental results show that the proposed technology can deduce structure member offsets accurately and efficiently.},

  abstract = {Android platform induces an open application development framework to attract more developers and promote larger market occupations. However, the open architecture also makes it easier to reverse engineering, which results in the property loss for both developers and companies, and increases the risks of mobile malicious code. Therefore, copyright protection for android application is of significant importance. A class of copyright protection methods are based on Android watermark. Different from static watermark, the process of embedding and extracting of dynamic graph watermark (DGW) is based on the function path and operation process of the app, which has better concealment. In this paper, we proposed a late-model dynamic watermark based on matrix, called “LMDGW” . This method is proposed to overcome the shortcoming of unintuitive and vulnerable property of traditional numberal DGW. We encode a matrix with low rank into a watermark graph, and embed the graph construction statements into smali code. With the containing of sensitive block characteristics, LMDGW is able to perceive and locate the changes in the specific block. Besides, LWDGW has great performance in tamper-proof attacks. Experiment results and analysis justified that LMDGW has great data rate and robust, and is available in sensitive code locating. LMDGW is proved to be an intelligent watermarking scheme, and is enlightening for intelligent security.},

  abstract = {One approach of Android security is the analysis for detecting potential information leaks. The current technical analyses (as static analysis, dynamic analysis, hybrid of static and dynamic analysis) only focus on action within a single application, while the coordinated action of several applications for the malicious purpose is becoming popular. This study proposes a hybrid approach that combines static and dynamic analysis to detect information leak as a result of the coordinated action of multiple applications. In this text, we call it inter-application malware. The analysis takes place in two stages. The first stage uses static analysis to indicate the chains of sensitive actions on multiple applications. The second stage validates whether the chain of sensitive actions indeed leaks user’s data by using the dynamic analysis. In fact, the applications in question are forced to execute after the chains of sensitive actions detected in the first stage. The sensitive actions are monitored and analyzed to determine which actions are the causes of information leakage. And we have implemented an analysis tool, named eDSDroid. We have evaluated our tool on the famous Toyapps test case. The test result shows the correctness and effectiveness of our tool.},

Therefore, an effective Android malware detection system is necessary. However, detecting the attack is challenging due to the similarity of the permissions in malware with those seen in benign applications. This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the machine learning approach for detecting Android malware. In this paper, we applied the bio-inspired algorithm as a feature optimization approach for selecting reliable permission features that able to identify malware attacks. A static analysis technique with machine learning classifier is developed from the permission features noted in the Android mobile device for detecting the malware applications. This technique shows that the use of Android permissions is a potential feature for malware detection. The study compares the bio-inspired algorithm [particle swarm optimization (PSO)] and the evolutionary computation with information gain to find the best features optimization in selecting features. The features were optimized from 378 to 11 by using bio-inspired algorithm: particle swarm optimization (PSO). The evaluation utilizes 5000 Drebin malware samples and 3500 benign samples. In recognizing the Android malware, it appears that AdaBoost is able to achieve good detection accuracy with a true positive rate value of 95.6\%, using Android permissions. The results show that particle swarm optimization (PSO) is the best feature optimization approach for selecting features.},

Many analysis methods for single app have been used in detecting the vulnerability and malicious code. Since mobile apps always related to each other by invoking components, some researchers began to focus on the analysis for multi-applications. But facing with millions of mobile applications, with limited resources, how to improve the ability of security analysis and protection is a difficult problem. For this purpose, we introduce a novel method to mine the correlation among a large number of applications, and finding the nodes that are in the critical position in the process of invoking components. In the proposed method, we first extract the important information from apps and build a database of components. Then, we try to analysis the potential relationship of apps based on the process of invoking components. Moreover, we proposed a novel metric of importance, which can help to find the apps which play important roles in the app-network. We did some experiments to evaluate the proposed method, the experiments show that, we can assess the influence of apps, and figure out the priority of targets during massive application analysis, whether for purpose of detection or protection.},

  abstract = {Vulnerability in industrial control systems (ICS) has increased radically in the past few decades. This can be accounted to reasons including accessibility of ICS through Internet, development of sophisticated attack methods, and advancement in Internet of Things (IoT). The damage that can be caused by attackers on insecure ICS could cost hundreds of human lives and a huge state economy. Therefore, having such systems every where around us makes the concern for security nothing but a priority. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are the central devices of ICS and also a target to attacks which aim at gaining access and privilege to the control logic of the controller. A successful alteration or intrusion of the control logic by attackers can have a catastrophic effect on the plant. In this paper, control logic intrusion detection methodology for PLC-based control systems is proposed. The methodology implements the detection process by comparing a potentially intruded PLC program with a trusted version of the program. In order to achieve this goal, a scheme is proposed that operates in sequence of stages by first translating the PLC program to formal models (based on previous research work), then translating the formal models to graphs followed by performing a comparison between a trusted system model graph and a potentially intruded system graph. In the last stage of the methodology, graph discrepancy analysis is made in order to identify any intrusions. For demonstration purposes, a water level control system is presented as a case study, which is modeled using UPPAAL toolbox. We have verified our methodology by developing an in-house software. Our test results prove the concept that intrusions can be shown as discrepancies in the graphs generated from the UPPAAL-based formal modeling, which can be detected utilizing the proposed graph comparison approach. The premise of our study is that logic intrusions in PLC based ICS can be identified by the changes in the PLC code, and the methodology we proposed can successfully detect those changes by observing the code’s graph model.},

Such concerns do not arise only from single apps, which might—accidentally or intentionally—leak private information to untrusted parties, but also from multiple apps communicating with each other. Certain combinations of apps can create critical data flows not detectable by analyzing single apps individually. While sophisticated tools exist to analyze data flows inside and across apps, none of these scale to large numbers of apps, given the combinatorial explosion of possible (inter-app) data flows. We present a scalable approach to analyze data flows across Android apps. At the heart of our approach is a graph-based data structure that represents inter-app flows efficiently. Following ideas from product-line analysis, the data structure exploits redundancies among flows and thereby tames the combinatorial explosion. Instead of focusing on specific installations of app sets on mobile devices, we lift traditional data-flow analysis approaches to analyze and represent data flows of all possible combinations of apps. We developed the tool Sifta and applied it to several existing app benchmarks and real-world app sets, demonstrating its scalability and accuracy.},

As the presence of kinematic singularities can extremely affect the robot’s performance, singularity regions in the task space for robot are clearly identified using determinant of the robot’s Jacobian matrix. Based on the free-form surface polishing requirements, programing an industrial robot with Teach Pendant manually is skill dependent and time consuming. Therefore, a scheme of an automatic polishing system is proposed, which includes a 6DOF arm robot.

The robot program which contains the polishing path is generated in certain order using RoboGuide software in virtual environment. A Human Machine Interface has been used to control the entire polishing system online. Finally, the generated path is successfully applied in robotic polishing system.

We propose an alternative approach, using an existing translation-validation framework, to enable high-assurance, automatic determination of loop bounds and infeasible paths. We show that this approach automatically determines all loop bounds and many (possibly all) infeasible paths in the seL4 microkernel, as well as in standard WCET benchmarks which are in the language subset of our C parser. We also design and validate an improvement to the seL4 implementation, which permits a key part of the kernel’s API to be available to users in a mixed-criticality setting.},

  abstract = {In this study we represent malware as opcode sequences and detect it using a deep belief network (DBN). Compared with traditional shallow neural networks, DBNs can use unlabeled data to pretrain a multi-layer generative model, which can better represent the characteristics of data samples. We compare the performance of DBNs with that of three baseline malware detection models, which use support vector machines, decision trees, and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm as classifiers. The experiments demonstrate that the DBN model provides more accurate detection than the baseline models. When additional unlabeled data are used for DBN pretraining, the DBNs perform better than the other detection models. We also use the DBNs as an autoencoder to extract the feature vectors of executables. The experiments indicate that the autoencoder can effectively model the underlying structure of input data and significantly reduce the dimensions of feature vectors.},

  abstract = {Recommending similar-interest users’ groups in multimedia services is the problem of detecting for each registered user his/her membership to one interest-group of relevant consumers. The consumers in each interest-group share some relevant preferences which guarantee that the interest-group as a whole satisfies some desired properties of similarity. As a result, forming these interest-groups requires the availability of personal data of different consumers. This is a crucial requirement for different recommender systems. With the increasing trend of service providers to collect a large volume of personal data regarding their end-users, presumably to better serve them. However, a significant part of the data that is typically collected is not essential to the service being offered, or to the completion of the services it was presumably released for. Gathering such unnecessary data can be seen as a privacy threat, and storing it exposes the end-users to further unavoidable risks. In this paper, a privacy aware group based recommender system is proposed for the automated discovery of appropriate interest groups in multimedia services. A fog based middleware (FMCP) was introduced that runs at end-users’ sides and allows exchanging of their information to facilities recommending and creating interest-groups without disclosing their real preferences to other consumers. The membership of consumers in various interest groups allows receiving highly appropriate and reliable multimedia content-related advices. The system utilizes two protocols to attain this goal.

  abstract = {In order to detect Android malware more effectively, an Android malware detection model was proposed based on improved naive Bayes classification. Firstly, considering the unknown permission that may be malicious in detection samples, and in order to improve the Android detection rate, the algorithm of malware detection is proposed based on improved naive Bayes. Considering the limited training samples, limited permissions, and the new malicious permissions in the test samples, we used the impact of the new malware permissions and training permissions as the weight. The weighted naive Bayesian algorithm improves the Android malware detection efficiency. Secondly, taking into account the detection model, we proposed a detection model of permissions and information theory based on the improved naive Bayes algorithm. We analyzed the correlation of the permission. By calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient, we determined the value of Pearson correlation coefficient r , and delete the permissions whose value r is less than the threshold \\(\\rho \\) and get the new permission set. So, we got the improved detection model by clustering based on information theory. Finally, we detected the 1725 Android malware and 945 non malicious application of multiple data sets in the same simulation environment. The detection rate of the improved the naive Bayes algorithm is 86.54\%, and the detection rate of the non-malicious application is increased to 97.59\%. Based on the improved naive Bayes algorithm, the false detection rate of the improved detection model is reduced by 8.25\%.},

As a result, data leakage accidents have been increasing, which can weaken companies’ competitiveness and can even threaten their survival. Therefore, many companies have recently adopted data leakage/loss prevention (DLP) solutions to avoid such leakages. However, these solutions and their study are limited to dedicated data channels such as SMS/MMS, HSPA and WIFI, but other types of channels, such as, voice call channels can be used to bypass and inactivate the DLP. In this paper, our attack model focuses on the malicious use of digital communication over these voice call channels by showing the possibility to deliver the text files, pictures and malicious codes. Furthermore, we also use post processing such as spell checking and image restoration for the maximum effectiveness of our attack scenario. Overall, we show the feasibility of voice call channels as new malicious attack channels.},

  abstract = {A large set of diverse hybrid mobile apps, which use both native Android app UIs and Web UIs, are widely available in today’s smartphones. These hybrid apps usually use SSL or TLS to secure HTTP based communication. However, researchers show that incorrect implementation of SSL or TLS may lead to serious security problems, such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks and phishing attacks. This paper investigates a particular SSL vulnerability that results from error-handling code in the hybrid mobile Web apps. Usually such error-handling code is used to terminate an ongoing communication, but the vulnerability of interest is able to make the communication proceed regardless of SSL certificate verification failures, eventually lead to MITM attacks. To identify those vulnerable apps, we develop a hybrid approach, which combines both static analysis and dynamic analysis to (1) automatically distinguish the native Android UIs and Web UIs, and execute the Web UIs to trigger the error-handling code; (2) accurately select the correct paths from the app entry-point to the targeted code, meanwhile avoiding the crash of apps, and populate messaging objects for the communication between components. Specifically, we construct inter-component call graphs to model the connections, and design algorithms to select the paths from the established graph and determine the parameters by backtracing. To evaluate our approach, we have implemented and tested it with 13,820 real world mobile Web apps from Google Play. The experimental results demonstrate that 1,360 apps are detected as potentially vulnerable ones solely using the static analysis. The dynamic analysis process further confirms that 711 apps are truly vulnerable among the potentially vulnerable set.},

However, how to measure security degree of Sensitive Information is an open issue. To our best knowledge, no effective method can detect secret trace of SI thieves in Advanced Persistent Threat (APT), especially for backdoors and vulnerabilities in software or firmware. To deal with these problems, we propose a new design, called, IIoT-SIDefender (IIoT-SID), we measure security degree of Sensitive Information via Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), based on selected taint tracking and real-time memory modification, attack-defense and fix-distribution approaches are proposed. Until now, it is the first defined SI guard method to detect SI-leakage scenarios and reject SI-leverage attack. To verify our proposal, experimental tests are verified in a large number of IIoT applications and devices, including IP cameras, smart meters, PLCs and smart routers. Test results have demonstrated that we can capture security level for Sensitive Information as expected, detect potential leakage points in data lifetime (including unknown backdoors and vulnerabilities), describe fine-grained semantics of accidental leakage and secret leverage points, and generate relative hot fix to prevent further attack.},

  abstract = {Today’s Android-powered smartphones have various embedded sensors that measure the acceleration, orientation, light and other environmental conditions. Many functions in the third-party applications (apps) need to use these sensors. However, embedded sensors may lead to security issues, as the third-party apps can read data from these sensors without claiming any permissions. It has been proven that embedded sensors can be exploited by well designed malicious apps, resulting in leaking users’ privacy. In this work, we are motivated to provide an overview of sensor usage patterns in current apps by investigating what, why and how embedded sensors are used in the apps collected from both a Chinese app. market called “AppChina” and the official market called “Google Play”. To fulfill this goal, We develop a tool called “SDFDroid” to identify the used sensors’ types and to generate the sensor data propagation graphs in each app. We then cluster the apps to find out their sensor usage patterns based on their sensor data propagation graphs. We apply our method on 22,010 apps collected from AppChina and 7,601 apps from Google Play. Extensive experiments are conducted and the experimental results show that most apps implement their sensor related functions by using the third-party libraries. We further study the sensor usage behaviors in the third-party libraries. Our results show that the accelerometer is the most frequently used sensor. Though many third-party libraries use no more than four types of sensors, there are still some third-party libraries registering all the types of sensors recklessly. These results call for more attentions on better regulating the sensor usage in Android apps.},

  abstract = {The number of mobile applications (apps) and mobile devices has increased considerably over the past few years. Online app markets, such as the Google Play Store, use a star-rating mechanism to quantify the user-perceived quality of mobile apps. Users may rate apps on a five point (star) scale where a five star-rating is the highest rating. Having considered the importance of a high star-rating to the success of an app, recent studies continue to explore the relationship between the app attributes, such as User Interface (UI) complexity, and the user-perceived quality. However, the user-perceived quality reflects the users’ experience using an app on a particular mobile device. Hence, the user-perceived quality of an app is not solely determined by app attributes. In this paper, we study the relation of both device attributes and app attributes with the user-perceived quality of Android apps from the Google Play Store. We study 20 device attributes, such as the CPU and the display size, and 13 app attributes, such as code size and UI complexity. Our study is based on data from 30 types of Android mobile devices and 280 Android apps. We use linear mixed effect models to identify the device attributes and app attributes with the strongest relationship with the user-perceived quality. We find that the code size has the strongest relationship with the user-perceived quality. However, some device attributes, such as the CPU, have stronger relationships with the user-perceived quality than some app attributes, such as the number of UI inputs and outputs of an app. Our work helps both device manufacturers and app developers. Manufacturers can focus on the attributes that have significant relationships with the user-perceived quality. Moreover, app developers should be careful about the devices for which they make their apps available because the device attributes have a strong relationship with the ratings that users give to apps.},

The amount of malware in mobile phones is increasing exponentially and poses a serious security threat.

In this paper, we proposed an ensemble machine learning system for the detection of malware on Android devices. More specifically, four groups of features including permissions, monitoring system events, sensitive API and permission rate are extracted to characterize each Android application (app). Then an ensemble random forest classifier is learned to detect whether an app is potentially malicious or not. The performance of our proposed method is evaluated on the actual data set using tenfold cross-validation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a highly accuracy of 89.91\%. For further assessing the performance of our method, we compared it with the state-of-the-art support vector machine classifier. Comparison results demonstrate that the proposed method is extremely promising and could provide a cost-effective alternative for Android malware detection.},

Afterwards, some improvements were proposed. However, all the published schemes have been shown to be insecure. AES was originally designed without consideration of execution in a white-box attack context. Because of the fixed confusion and diffusion operations, it is easy to break AES’s white-box version. In this paper, we propose an AES-like cipher by replacing AES’s S-boxes and MixColumn matrices with key-dependent components while keeping their good cryptographic properties.

However, they also link with external networks to provide additional services (bidirectional services or commerce-related services). Therefore, broadcast business operators of with various types of broadcast media are susceptible to security threats from which their broadcasting services may come to a halt or may be abused by hackers, such as with well-developed APT attacks, as well as other common external attacks. The common vulnerability scoring system for IT security is used to conduct a quantitative evaluation of the risk to security threats for broadcasting services.

Such a discovery of authorship might be possible due to stylistic features inherent to software codes written by human programmers. Existing studies of authorship attribution of general purpose software mainly focus on source code, which is typically based on the style of programs and environment. However, those features critically depend on the availability of the program source code, which is usually not the case when dealing with malware binaries. Such program binaries often do not retain many semantic or stylistic features due to the compilation process. Therefore, authorship attribution in the domain of malware binaries based on features and styles that will survive the compilation process is challenging. This paper provides the state of the art in this literature. Further, we analyze the features involved in those techniques. By using a case study, we identify features that can survive the compilation process.

The proposed approach exploits an algorithm named Categorical Clustering Tree (CCTree), which can be used both as a divisive clustering algorithm, or as a trainable classifier for supervised learning classification. Hence, the CCTree has been exploited to perform both homogeneous clustering, grouping similar malicious apps for simplified analysis, and to classify them in predefined behavioral classes. The approach has been tested on a set of 3500 real malicious apps belonging to more than 200 families, showing both an high clustering capability, measured through internal and external evaluation, together with an accuracy of 97\% in classifying malicious apps according to their behavior.},

Specification of applicable level of abstraction for investigation and detection of malware may present a serious challenge. Many approaches claim using high-level abstraction of malware behaviour but they are still based on sequences of instructions which form the malicious program. Techniques which rely on syntactic representation potentially fail whenever malware writers employ mutation or obfuscation of malicious code. Our work presents a different strategy. We utilised freely available information about malicious programs which were already inspected and tried to find patterns in malware behaviour, which are not bound to syntactic representation of malicious samples and so should withstand malware mutation on the syntactic level.},

  abstract = {Android platforms are known as the less security smartphone devices. The increasing number of malicious apps published on Android markets suppose an important threat to users sensitive data, compromising more devices everyday. The commercial solutions that aims to fight against this malware are based on signature methodologies whose detection ratio is low. Furthermore, these engines can be easily defeated by obfuscation techniques, which are extremely common in app plagiarism. This work aims to improve malware detection using only the binary information and the permissions that are normally used by the anti-virus engines, in order to provide a scalable solution based on machine learning. In order to evaluate the performance of this approach, we carry out our experiments using 5000 malware and 5000 benign-ware, and compare the results with 56 Anti-Virus Engines from VirusTotal.},

  abstract = {To build effective malware analysis techniques and to evaluate new detection tools, up-to-date datasets reflecting the current Android malware landscape are essential. For such datasets to be maximally useful, they need to contain reliable and complete information on malware’s behaviors and techniques used in the malicious activities. Such a dataset shall also provide a comprehensive coverage of a large number of types of malware. The Android Malware Genome created circa 2011 has been the only well-labeled and widely studied dataset the research community had easy access to (As of 12/21/2015 the Genome authors have stopped supporting the dataset sharing due to resource limitation). But not only is it outdated and no longer represents the current Android malware landscape, it also does not provide as detailed information on malware’s behaviors as needed for research. Thus it is urgent to create a high-quality dataset for Android malware. While existing information sources such as VirusTotal are useful, to obtain the accurate and detailed information for malware behaviors, deep manual analysis is indispensable. In this work we present our approach to preparing a large Android malware dataset for the research community. We leverage existing anti-virus scan results and automation techniques in categorizing our large dataset (containing 24,650 malware app samples) into 135 varieties (based on malware behavioral semantics) which belong to 71 malware families. For each variety, we select three samples as representatives, for a total of 405 malware samples, to conduct in-depth manual analysis. Based on the manual analysis result we generate detailed descriptions of each malware variety’s behaviors and include them in our dataset. We also report our observations on the current landscape of Android malware as depicted in the dataset. Furthermore, we present detailed documentation of the process used in creating the dataset, including the guidelines for the manual analysis. We make our Android malware dataset available to the research community.},

  abstract = {Most security solutions that rely on binary rewriting assume a clean separation between code and data. Unfortunately, jump tables violate this assumption. In particular, switch statements in binary code often appear as indirect jumps with jump tables that interleave with executable code—especially on ARM architectures. Most existing rewriters and disassemblers handle jump tables in a crude manner, by means of pattern matching. However, any deviation from the pattern (e.g. slightly different instructions) leads to a mismatch. Instead, we propose a complementary approach to “solve” jump tables and automatically find the right target addresses of the indirect jump by means of a tailored Value Set Analysis (VSA). Our approach is generic and applies to binary code without any need for source, debug symbols, or compiler generated patterns. We benchmark our technique on a large corpus of ARM binaries, including malware and firmware. For gcc binaries, our results approach those of IDA Pro when IDA has symbols (which is generally not the case), while for clang binaries we outperform IDA Pro with debug symbols by orders of magnitude: IDA finds 11 of 828 switch statements implemented as jump tables in SPEC, while we find 763.},

  abstract = {Attackers use reverse engineering techniques to gain detailed understanding of executable for malicious purposes, such as re-packaging an Android app to inject malicious code or advertising components. To make reverse engineering more difficult, researchers have proposed various code obfuscation techniques to conceal purposes or logic of code segments. One interesting idea of code obfuscation is to apply code-reuse techniques (e.g., Return-Oriented Programming) to (re-)distribute essential code segments before they are reconstructed at runtime. Such techniques are well understood on x86 platform, but relatively less explored on Android. In this paper, we present an evaluation on the extent to which code-reuse-based techniques can be applied to obfuscate Android apps. Moreover, we extend code-reuse-based obfuscation to the Android platform by proposing an obfuscation mechanism for both Java and native code. Results show that 835 gadgets are found in the C standard library ( libc.so ) which cover the entire Turing complete set. Furthermore, we implement a semi-automatic tool named AndroidCubo and show that it protects both Java and native code with comparable security to those obfuscated with Java reflection at a small runtime overhead.},

We exploit difficulty for machines in rotating 3D objects to find a correct view point and in further recognizing characters in 3D, both tasks that humans can easily perform. Using an offline automated computer vision attack, we found that 82\% of the new text reCAPTCHA characters were successfully detected, while approximately 60\% of our 3D CAPTCHAs were detected only if characters were focused and zoomed from the direct view point. When CAPTCHAs are presented in slightly different views, the attack success rates against our approaches are reduced to almost 0\%.},

Both technical and social vulnerabilities were observed, that would allow an adversary to steal individual’s credential information or leak it. Moreover, a usable and secure payment guidelines and steps will be provided to make a better payment application which will gain users’ trust and e-commerce business. To measure the performance of the used payment app, one needs to dive off the boat in order to understand the flaws. Venmo, Google Wallet, and Apple Pay are the key apps that are analyzed and risks are observed in relation to social engineering.

Preliminary research indicates that many types of IoT devices have serious vulnerabilities. It is not easy to investigate security and privacy issues since each type of device is different and manual experiments need to be conducted on the device. In this paper, we propose a framework for investigation of security and privacy issues of IoT devices. The framework consists of four components, a testbed, set of topics to be investigated, a set of experiments for each topic investigated and a final report. Fundamental approach used in the framework is to capture layer 2 and layer 3 packets and to analyze the packets for various features. Proposed framework is low cost and is based on off-the-shelf hardware and open source software. Using the framework, we can investigate security and privacy issues of many IoT devices including HDMI sticks, IP cameras, activity trackers, smartwatches and drones. A large set of topics can be investigated on IoT devices using the framework including vulnerability issues, protocol security, firmware updates, authentication issues and privacy violations. Sample experimental results show the promise of the proposed framework. We believe this framework will serve as the foundation for a general automated framework to investigate security and privacy issues of most IoT devices.},

To improve the effectiveness of the binary software static vulnerability detection, this paper proposes a fusion method for binary software vulnerability detection which first represents the binary software as a single property graph and then the vulnerability is modeled and detected based on this property graph. Because property graph includes integrated information such as the relations between function calls, control flow, data flow relationship and so on, researchers can model vulnerability more easily and accurately. It can detect unknown vulnerabilities accurately and effi-ciently. The experiments of prototype system show that this method can effectively detect Return-Value-Unchecked Vulnerability in binary software.},

  abstract = {Leaking personal information on mobile devices is a serious problem. Work on information leak detection for mobile devices, until now, mostly focus on action within a single application, while the coordinated action of several applications for the malicious purpose is becoming popular. This study proposes a hybrid approach that combines static and dynamic analysis to detect information leak as a result of the coordinated action of multiple applications. In this text, we call it inter-application malware. The analysis takes place in two stages. In the first stage, we use static analysis to determine the chains of sensitive actions on multiple applications. The chain of sensitive actions is the sequential user’s actions that may lead to information leakage. In the second stage, we validate whether the chain of sensitive actions indeed leaks user’s data by using the dynamic analysis. In fact, the applications in question are forced to execute after the chains of sensitive actions detected in the first stage. We monitor the sensitive actions to determine which actions make information leak. In order to do so, we modify the Android Emulator to trigger and monitor any action of any applications running on it. We have evaluated our tool, namely eDSDroid, on the famous Toyapps test case. The test result shows the correctness and effectiveness of our tool.},

Current solutions produce low accuracy and high false positives in presence of obfuscation or benign cryptographic API usage. Moreover, they are inadequate in detecting ransomware attack in early stages before infection happens. In this paper, DNA-Droid, a two layer detection framework is proposed. It benefits of a dynamic analysis layer as a complementary layer on top of a static analysis layer. The DNA-Droid utilizes novel features and deep neural network to achieve a set of features with high discriminative power between ransomware and benign samples. Moreover, Sequence Alignment techniques are employed to profile ransomware families. This helps in detecting ransomware activity in early stages before the infection happens. In order to extract dynamic features, a fully automated Android sandbox is developed which is publicly available for researchers as a web service. The DNA-Droid is tested against thousands of samples. The experimental results shows high precision and recall in detecting even unknown ransomware samples, while keeping the false negative rate below 1.5\%.},

  abstract = {With explosive growth of Android malware and due to its damage to smart phone users, the detection of Android malware is one of the cybersecurity topics that are of great interests. To protect legitimate users from the evolving Android malware attacks, systems using machine learning techniques have been successfully deployed and offer unparalleled flexibility in automatic Android malware detection. Unfortunately, as machine learning based classifiers become more widely deployed, the incentive for defeating them increases. In this paper, we explore the security of machine learning in Android malware detection on the basis of a learning-based classifier with the input of Application Programming Interface (API) calls extracted from the smali files. In particular, we consider different levels of the attackers’ capability and present a set of corresponding evasion attacks to thoroughly assess the security of the classifier. To effectively counter these evasion attacks, we then propose a robust secure-learning paradigm and show that it can improve system security against a wide class of evasion attacks. The proposed model can also be readily applied to other security tasks, such as anti-spam and fraud detection.},

  abstract = {Machine learning approaches to source code authorship attribution attempt to find statistical regularities in human-generated source code that can identify the author or authors of that code. This has applications in plagiarism detection, intellectual property infringement, and post-incident forensics in computer security. The introduction of features derived from the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of source code has recently set new benchmarks in this area, significantly improving over previous work that relied on easily obfuscatable lexical and format features of program source code. However, these AST-based approaches rely on hand-constructed features derived from such trees, and often include ancillary information such as function and variable names that may be obfuscated or manipulated. In this work, we provide novel contributions to AST-based source code authorship attribution using deep neural networks. We implement Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) models to automatically extract relevant features from the AST representation of programmers’ source code. We show that our models can automatically learn efficient representations of AST-based features without needing hand-constructed ancillary information used by previous methods. Our empirical study on multiple datasets with different programming languages shows that our proposed approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance for source code authorship attribution on AST-based features, despite not leveraging information that was previously thought to be required for high-confidence classification.},

  abstract = {In order to handle the complexity and heterogeneity of modern instruction set architectures, analysis platforms share a common design, the adoption of hardware-independent intermediate representations. The usage of these platforms to verify systems down to binary-level is appealing due to the high degree of automation they provide. However, it introduces the need for trusting the correctness of the translation from binary code to intermediate language. Achieving a high degree of trust is challenging since this transpilation must handle (i) all the side effects of the instructions, (ii) multiple instruction encoding (e.g. ARM Thumb), and (iii) variable instruction length (e.g. Intel). We overcome these problems by formally modeling one of such intermediate languages in the interactive theorem prover HOL4 and by implementing a proof-producing transpiler. This tool translates ARMv8 programs to the intermediate language and generates a HOL4 proof that demonstrates the correctness of the translation in the form of a simulation theorem. We also show how the transpiler theorems can be used to transfer properties verified on the intermediate language to the binary code.},

Most of the existing research on binary code type inference tend to resort to program analysis techniques, which can be too conservative to infer types with high accuracy or too heavy-weight to be viable in practice. In this paper, we propose a new approach to learning types for recovered variables from their related representative instructions. Our idea is motivated by “duck typing”, where the type of a variable is determined by its features and properties. Our approach first learns a classifier from existing binaries with debug information and then uses this classifier to predict types for new, unseen binaries. We have implemented our approach in a tool called BITY and used it to conduct some experiments on a well-known benchmark coreutils (v8.4). The results show that our tool is more precise than the commercial tool Hey-Rays, both in terms of correct types and compatible types.},

Keeping these e-documents secure is fundamental to enterprise security, especially in multi-site enterprises or when sharing e-documents with third party.

These leaks are mainly caused by internal attack wither intentional or due to accident and employee ignorance. After exploring the landscape of the current e-document sharing security issues, this chapter proposes a framework to address these issues. The proposed framework is adapting current technologies in new novel approach to deliver a secure environment to share e-documents and track them. The confirmed framework secures documents not only inside the enterprise, but also when they leave the enterprise boundaries via networks or portable devices. As the author’s knowledge extends, there is no other work similar to what this paper provide regarding proposing such a framework. The framework provides a persistent and secure environment through the e-document life cycle and ability to track the document. The framework components design is based on analysing the literature of the current issues and available solutions. These components were confirmed after surveying security professionals and interviewing fourteen security experts. The framework includes components utilising active document concept, digital right management concept, context awareness, and a central certification authority service.},

Prior research mainly focuses on how the features of mobile operating systems can affect the OAuth security. However, little has been done to analyze whether these significant modifications of the protocol call-flow can be well understood and implemented by app developers. Towards this end, we report a field-study on the Android OAuth2.0-based single-sign-on systems. In particular, we perform an in-depth static code analysis on three identity provider apps including Facebook, Google and Sina as well as their official SDKs to understand their OAuth-related transactions. We then dynamically test 600 top-ranked US and Chinese Android apps. Apart from various types of existing vulnerabilities, we also discover three previously unknown security flaws among these first-tier identity providers and a large number of popular 3rd-party apps. For example, 41\% apps under study are susceptible to a newly discovered profile attack, which unlike prior works, enables remote account hijacking without any need to trick or interact with the victim. The prevalence of vulnerabilities further motivates us to propose/implement an alternative, fool-proof OAuth SDK for one of the affected IdPs to automatically prevent from these vulnerabilities. To facilitate the adoption of our proposed fixes, our solution requires minimal code changes by the 3rd-party-developers of the affected mobile apps.},

We apply existing TLS testing methods to the apps which only find errors in legacy apps. We then go on to look at extensions of these methods and find five of the apps have serious vulnerabilities. In particular, we find an app that pins a TLS root CA certificate, but do not verify the hostname. In this case, the use of certificate pinning means that all existing test methods would miss detecting the hostname verification flaw. We also find one app that doesn’t check the certificate hostname, but bypasses proxy settings, resulting in failed detection by pentesting tools. We find that three apps load adverts over insecure connections, which could be exploited for in-app phishing attacks. Some of the apps used the users’ PIN as authentication, for which PCI guidelines require extra security, so these apps use an additional cryptographic protocol; we study the underlying protocol of one banking app in detail and show that it provides little additional protection, meaning that an active man-in-the-middle attacker can retrieve the user’s credentials, login to the bank and perform every operation the legitimate user could.},

Some researchers have proposed machine learning methods which can detect malware variants by searching the similarities between malware and its variants. However, the large search space causes large time cost and memory space occupation. To reduce the search space while retaining the accuracy, we firstly propose to convert malware into global opcode matrix which is based on 2-tuple opcodes, and then cluster the opcode matrixes to patterns. We can easily recognize the malware variants by searching the similarities with the patterns. The experiments demonstrate that our approach is more efficient than the state-of-art approaches in time cost, memory space occupation and accuracy.},

  abstract = {As smartphone are becoming more common, services using smartphones are becoming more pervasive too. Among them, as mobile banking transactions are increasing, payment fraud is also rapidly increasing. These services handle sensitive information, such as users’ personal information and payment information, but as they have several security vulnerabilities, they are attacked by malicious apps. This paper proposes a method of deriving malicious app detection signatures based on the behavior information, obtained by analyzing malicious apps collected through several application distribution channels, and these signatures will be used for analysis of variants of malicious apps and development of rule-based malicious app detection systems.},

  abstract = {Code protection schemes nowadays adopt language embedding, a technique in which a customized language is built within a general-purpose one, often referred to as the host language, to obfuscate original code through transforming it into a customized form with which the analyst is not familiar. The transformed code is then interpreted by a so-called Embedded VM. This type of transformation does increase the cost of code comprehending and maintaining, and introduces extra runtime overhead. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth study on embedded VM based code protection and propose a de-obfuscation approach that aims to recover the original code form. Our approach first pinpoints the interpretation procedure and partitions handlers of the embedded VM, and then employs a VM-state based handler translating, which represents the VM-state-updated behaviors of handlers. Finally, the translated operations of each handler is optimized and transformed into host code. After this process, we can obtain a clear and runtime efficient code representation. We build Nightingale , a binary translation tool, to fulfil this de-obfuscation automatically with x86 binary executables. We test our approach on the latest commercial code obfuscators, embedded domain-specific languages and a set of home brewed obfuscation schemes. The results demonstrate that this kind of obfuscated code can be simplified with host language effectively.},

Towards this end, we re-investigate in this paper the security concerns of smartbands. In particular, we first introduce our detailed methodology for security analysis, including log analysis, Hook technology, and Android reverse engineering. Then, we apply it to popular commercial smartbands of three different brands the concrete information of which is omitted, identify their common vulnerabilities, and develop accordingly a fake Android application (App) utilizing the identified loopholes, given the protection measures of shelling, obfuscation, as well as forcible pairing and resetting. By installing the fake App, we are able to conduct deception attacks against the targeted smartbands, succeeding to remotely activate/deactivate shaking function, to adjust/modify time (including value and format), and to obtain the smartband owner’s sensitive/health data. During our deception attacks, no cooperation from the smartband owner is required, neither the pairing process between the targeted smartbands and our fake App.},

  abstract = {The increasing amount and diversity of malicious applications are reducing efficiency of conventional defenses and it is necessary to create novel method for detection. Consequently, we propose PCSD, a lightweight tool for detection of Android malware by extracting statistical features from applications. As the influence of individual difference, PCSD performs cluster algorithm to reduce particularity. Meanwhile, it minimizes effect of random cluster by selecting cluster, which has minimum volatility on size per cluster, for improving detection accuracy. In our work, we collect statistical features from 5,553 malicious applications and 3,000 benign applications and build train model for detecting on the basis of different machine learning algorithms, like Bayesian ridge, Random forests, etc. Our results show that accuracy is 99.02\% and AUC (Area Under Curve) is 99.51\% in experiment. These results demonstrate the efficacy of PCSD to distinguish malicious and benign android applications.},

  abstract = {In recent years numerous advanced malware, aka advanced persistent threats (APT) are allegedly developed by nation-states. The task of attributing an APT to a specific nation-state is extremely challenging for several reasons. Each nation-state has usually more than a single cyber unit that develops such advanced malware, rendering traditional authorship attribution algorithms useless. Furthermore, those APTs use state-of-the-art evasion techniques, making feature extraction challenging. Finally, the dataset of such available APTs is extremely small. In this paper we describe how deep neural networks (DNN) could be successfully employed for nation-state APT attribution. We use sandbox reports (recording the behavior of the APT when run dynamically) as raw input for the neural network, allowing the DNN to learn high level feature abstractions of the APTs itself. Using a test set of 1,000 Chinese and Russian developed APTs, we achieved an accuracy rate of 94.6\%.},

  abstract = {While much effort has been made to detect and measure the privacy leakage caused by the advertising (ad) libraries integrated in mobile applications (i.e., apps), analytics libraries, which are also widely used in mobile apps have not been systematically studied for their privacy risks. Different from ad libraries, the main function of analytics libraries is to collect users’ in-app actions. Hence, by design, analytics libraries are more likely to leak users’ private information. In this work, we study what information is collected by the analytics libraries integrated in popular Android apps. We design and implement a tool called “Alde”. Given an app, Alde employs both static analysis and dynamic analysis to detect the data collected by analytics libraries. We also study what private information can be leaked by the apps that use the same analytics library. Moreover, we analyze apps’ privacy policies to see whether app developers have notified the users that their in-app action information is collected by analytics libraries. Finally, we select 8 widely used analytics libraries to study and apply our method on 300 apps downloaded from both Chinese app markets and Google play. Our experimental results request the emerging need for better regulating the use of analytics libraries in Android apps.},

  abstract = {Bring-your-own-device (BYOD) is getting popular. Diverse personal devices are used to access enterprise resources, and deployment of the solutions with customized operating system (OS) dependency will thus be restricted. Moreover, device utilization for both business and personal purposes creates new threats involving leakage of sensitive data. As for functionalities, a BYOD solution should isolate an arbitrary number of entities, such as those relating to business and personal uses and provide fine-grained access control on multi-entity management. Existing BYOD solutions lack in these aspects; we propose a system, called AppShield , which supports multi-entity management and role-based access control with file-level granularity, apart from local data sharing/isolation. AppShield includes (1) application rewriting framework for Android apps, which builds Mobile Application Management (MAM) features into app automatically with complete mediation, (2) cross-platform proxy-based data access mechanism, which can enforce arbitrary access control policies. The fully functional controller with data proxy is implemented for both Android and iOS. AppShield allows for enterprise policy management without modifying device OS. The evaluation shows that AppShield is successful at policy enforcement and is reliable. It induces little impact on application’s performance and size, for example, our app rewriting introduces less than 5\% code size increment in over 95\% apps in our evaluation.},

  abstract = {A lot of privacy data are generated by using mobile social networking applications (MSNAs) and the values of user’s privacy data in those applications increase with the establishment and development of big data platform, which makes MSNAs the primary target to be analyzed. Therefore, it is important to analyze privacy leakage and protect user’s privacy in the MSNAs. However, the existing approaches of data leakage detection in the Android platform are not suitable for MSNAs, e.g. VetDroid are considered as an impractical means since they require users’ frequent participation; TaintDroid and the detection methods based on it require the modification of Android system or the modification and re-package of the application, so the cost of the experiment will increase, and the operating efficiency of the application will decrease apparently. In this paper, we propose a privacy leakage detection tool named X-Decaf (X-Posed based Detection of Cache File) as well as an auto-protection method named ATFed (Automatic Transparent File Encryption/Decryption) in MSNAs on the Android platform. These two methods are designed to solve the above-mentioned issues under the conditions of keeping low coupling with the Android system and posing low impacts on the original MSNA.},

Some static checkers have been proposed to check whether an Android app is vulnerable to privacy leakage and other attacks. However, these checkers model the control flows in the app following the ICC events, ignoring the intrinsic purpose of users’ interaction with mobile devices. In fact, users carry out various tasks using mobile apps, e.g. online shopping. An Android task consists of one or more Activities, which are organized in the back stack of the task. By extracting the task lists among Activities in Android apps, we can capture all control flow transitions between them, including those bring by ICC events and back button events. We design and implement a system, which leverages the combination of static and dynamic analysis to extract the task lists. Our system can be used to detect task related attacks and help static checkers construct more complete call graphs.},
