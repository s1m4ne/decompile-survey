  abstract={Mapping a binary function taken from a compiled binary to the same function in the original source code has many security applications, such as discovering reused free open source code in malware binaries. To facilitate malware analysis, we present BINDEEP, a framework that learns the semantic relationships among binary functions based on assembly code. It also learns semantic information about the source functions in order to carry out function matching. We demonstrate how BINDEEP can be applied to fingerprint the origin of functions in malware binaries, and then benchmark its performance against that of five competing systems (i.e., RESOURCE, the Binary Analysis Tool (BAT), BinPro, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), and FOSSIL). The findings show that BINDEEP is more robust and achieves significant improvement over these existing systems when confronted with changes introduced by code transformation methods or the use of different compilers and optimization levels. Furthermore, BINDEEP is able to discover source packages in malware binaries, such as Zeus and Citadel, that match those listed in existing security reports.},

  abstract={Matching binary to source code and vice versa has various applications in different fields, such as computer security, software engineering, and reverse engineering. Even though there exist methods that try to match source code with binary code to accelerate the reverse engineering process, most of them are designed to focus on one programming language. However, in real life, programs are developed using different programming languages depending on their requirements. Thus, cross-language binary-to-source code matching has recently gained more attention. Nonetheless, the existing approaches still struggle to have precise predictions due to the inherent difficulties when the problem of matching binary code and source code needs to be addressed across programming languages. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-language binary source code matching. We propose GraphBinMatch, an approach based on a graph neural network that learns the similarity between binary and source codes. We evaluate GraphBinMatch on several tasks, such as cross-language binary-to-source code matching and cross-language source-to-source matching. We also evaluate the performance of our approach on single-language binary-to-source code matching. Experimental results show that GraphBinMatch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art, with improvements as high as 15% over the F1 score.},
