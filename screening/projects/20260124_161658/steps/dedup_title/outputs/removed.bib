  abstract = {Sensitivity properties describe how changes to the input of a program affect the output, typically by upper bounding the distance between the outputs of two runs by a monotone function of the distance between the corresponding inputs. When programs are probabilistic, the distance between outputs is a distance between distributions. The Kantorovich lifting provides a general way of defining a distance between distributions by lifting the distance of the underlying sample space; by choosing an appropriate distance on the base space, one can recover other usual probabilistic distances, such as the Total Variation distance. We develop a relational pre-expectation calculus to upper bound the Kantorovich distance between two executions of a probabilistic program. We illustrate our methods by proving algorithmic stability of a machine learning algorithm, convergence of a reinforcement learning algorithm, and fast mixing for card shuffling algorithms. We also consider some extensions: proving lower bounds on the Total Variation distance and convergence to the uniform distribution. Finally, we describe an asynchronous extension of our calculus to reason about pairs of program executions with different control flow.},

  abstract = {Reverse engineering binaries is required to understand and analyse programs for which the source code is unavailable. Decompilers can transform the largely unreadable binaries into a more readable source code-like representation. However, reverse engineering is time-consuming, much of which is taken up by labelling the functions with semantic information. While the automated summarisation of decompiled code can help Reverse Engineers understand and analyse binaries, current work mainly focuses on summarising source code, and no suitable dataset exists for this task. In this work, we extend large pre-trained language models of source code to summarise decompiled binary functions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of input and data properties on the performance of such models. Our approach consists of two main components; the data and the model. We first build CAPYBARA, a dataset of 214K decompiled function-documentation pairs across various compiler optimisations. We extend CAPYBARA further by generating synthetic datasets and deduplicating the data. Next, we fine-tune the CodeT5 base model with CAPYBARA to create BinT5. BinT5 achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU-4 score of 60.83, 58.82, and 44.21 for summarising source, decompiled, and synthetically stripped decompiled code, respectively. This indicates that these models can be extended to decompiled binaries successfully. Finally, we found that the performance of BinT5 is not heavily dependent on the dataset size and compiler optimisation level. We recommend future research to further investigate transferring knowledge when working with less expressive input formats such as stripped binaries.},

However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. However, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect. This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompiler based on a sequence-to-sequence transformer trained over real-world code. We develop a novel tokenizer and exploit no-dropout training to produce high-quality code. We utilize type-inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code. We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 functions from ExeBench on two ISAs and at two optimizations levels. SLaDe is up to 6 times more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4 times more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both.},

It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks.},

Chen et al. were able to demonstrate a substantial increase in name and type extraction accuracy on Hex-Rays decompiler outputs compared to existing static analysis and AI-based techniques. We extend the original DIRTY results by re-training the DIRTY model on a dataset produced by the open-source Ghidra decompiler. Although Chen et al. concluded that Ghidra was not a suitable decompiler candidate due to its difficulty in parsing and incorporating DWARF symbols during analysis, we demonstrate that straightforward parsing of variable data generated by Ghidra results in similar retyping performance.

While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code with prompt engineering. Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 73.33\% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance, suggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs continue to advance. In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, improving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart contracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3 projects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD. MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education. It empowers users to easily and independently review and audit non-open-source smart contracts, fostering accountability and decentralization},

While state-of-the-art class inheritance inference solutions are effective in dealing with unoptimized code, their efficacy is impeded by optimization. Particularly, constructor inlining–or worse exclusion–due to optimization render class inheritance recovery challenging. Further, while modern solutions such as MARX can successfully group classes within an inheritance sub-tree, they fail to establish directionality of inheritance, which is crucial for security-related applications (e.g. decompilation). We implemented a prototype of DeClassifier using Binary Analysis Platform (BAP) and evaluated DeClassifier against 16 binaries compiled using gcc under multiple optimization settings. We show that (1) DeClassifier can recover 94.5\% and 71.4\% true positive directed edges in the class hierarchy tree under O0 and O2 optimizations respectively, (2) a combination of ctor+dtor analysis provides much better inference than ctor only analysis.},

  abstract = {Complexities that arise from implementation of object-oriented concepts in C++ such as virtual dispatch and dynamic type casting have attracted the attention of attackers and defenders alike. Binary-level defenses are dependent on full and precise recovery of class inheritance tree of a given program. While current solutions focus on recovering single and multiple inheritances from the binary, they are oblivious to virtual inheritance. Conventional wisdom among binary-level defenses is that virtual inheritance is uncommon and/or support for single and multiple inheritances provides implicit support for virtual inheritance. In this paper, we show neither to be true. Specifically, (1) we present an efficient technique to detect virtual inheritance in C++ binaries and show through a study that virtual inheritance can be found in non-negligible number (more than 10\% on Linux and 12.5\% on Windows) of real-world C++ programs including Mysql and libstdc++. (2) we show that failure to handle virtual inheritance introduces both false positives and false negatives in the hierarchy tree. These false positves and negatives either introduce attack surface when the hierarchy recovered is used to enforce CFI policies, or make the hierarchy difficult to understand when it is needed for program understanding (e.g., during decompilation). (3) We present a solution to recover virtual inheritance from COTS binaries. We recover a maximum of 95\% and 95.5\% (GCC -O0) and a minimum of 77.5\% and 73.8\% (Clang -O2) of virtual and intermediate bases respectively in the virtual inheritance tree.},

  abstract = {Energy efficiency is a non-functional requirement that developers must consider. This requirement is particularly relevant when building software for battery-operated devices like mobile ones: a long-lasting battery is an essential requirement for an enjoyable user experience. It has been shown that many mobile applications include inefficiencies that cause battery to be drained faster than necessary. Some of these inefficiencies result from software patterns that have been catalogued in the literature. The catalogues often provide more energy-efficient alternatives. While the related literature is vast, most approaches so far assume as a fundamental requirement that one has access to the source code of an application in order to be able to analyse it. This requirement makes independent energy analysis challenging, or even impossible, e.g. for a mobile user or, most significantly, an App Store trying to provide information on how efficient an application being submitted for publication is. Our work studies the viability of looking for known energy patterns in applications by decompiling them and analysing the resulting code. For this, we decompiled and analysed 236 open-source applications. We extended an existing tool to aid in this process, making it capable of seamlessly decompiling and analysing android applications. With the collected data, we performed a comparative analysis of the presence of energy patterns between the source code and the decompiled code. While further research is required to more assertively say if this type of static analysis is viable, our results point in a promising direction with 163 applications, approximately 69\%, containing the same number of detected patterns in both source code and the release APK.},

Consequently, the decompilation process, which aims at producing source code from bytecode, must establish some strategies to reconstruct the information that has been lost. Modern Java decompilers tend to use distinct strategies to achieve proper decompilation. In this work, we hypothesize that the diverse ways in which bytecode can be decompiled has a direct impact on the quality of the source code produced by decompilers. We study the effectiveness of eight Java decompilers with respect to three quality indicators: syntactic correctness, syntactic distortion and semantic equivalence modulo inputs. This study relies on a benchmark set of 14 real-world open-source software projects to be decompiled (2041 classes in total). Our results show that no single modern decompiler is able to correctly handle the variety of bytecode structures coming from real-world programs.

Software composition analysis, proposed to identify reused TPLs for reducing such risks, has become an essential procedure within modern DevSecOps. As one of the mainstream SCA techniques, binary-to-source SCA identifies the third-party source projects contained in binary files via binary source code matching, which is a major challenge in reverse engineering since binary and source code exhibit substantial disparities after compilation. The existing binary-to-source SCA techniques leverage basic syntactic features that suffer from redundancy and lack robustness in the large-scale TPL dataset, leading to inevitable false positives and compromised recall. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce BinaryAI, a novel binary-to-source SCA technique with two-phase binary source code matching to capture both syntactic and semantic code features. First, BinaryAI trains a transformer-based model to produce function-level embeddings and obtain similar source functions for each binary function accordingly. Then by applying the link-time locality to facilitate function matching, BinaryAI detects the reused TPLs based on the ratio of matched source functions. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BinaryAI in terms of binary source code matching and the downstream SCA task. Specifically, our embedding model outperforms the state-of-the-art model CodeCMR, i.e., achieving 22.54\% recall@1 and 0.34 MRR compared with 10.75\% and 0.17 respectively. Additionally, BinaryAI outperforms all existing binary-to-source SCA tools in TPL detection, increasing the precision from 73.36\% to 85.84\% and recall from 59.81\% to 64.98\% compared with the well-recognized commercial SCA product.},

PRD lifts suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level techniques. Although decompilation and recompilation do not typically work on an entire binary, our approach succeeds because it is limited to a few functions, like those identified by our binary fault localization. We evaluate these assumptions and find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, 70-89\% of individual functions are successfully decompiled and recompiled with sufficient type recovery. In comparison, only 1.7\% of the full C-binaries succeed. When decompilation succeeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 92.9\% of the time. In addition, we evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating only on binaries, performs as well as, and sometimes better than full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a success rate consistent with these same tools operating with access to the entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those produced by top CGC teams. For generality, our evaluation includes two independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world binaries.},

@article{ringer_proof_2021-1,
  abstract = {We describe a new approach to automatically repairing broken proofs in the Coq proof assistant in response to changes in types. Our approach combines a configurable proof term transformation with a decompiler from proof terms to tactic scripts. The proof term transformation implements transport across equivalences in a way that removes references to the old version of the changed type and does not rely on axioms beyond those Coq assumes. We have implemented this approach in PUMPKIN Pi, an extension to the PUMPKIN PATCH Coq plugin suite for proof repair. We demonstrate PUMPKIN Pi's flexibility on eight case studies, including supporting a benchmark from a user study, easing development with dependent types, porting functions and proofs between unary and binary numbers, and supporting an industrial proof engineer to interoperate between Coq and other verification tools more easily.},

  abstract = {WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) has emerged as a cornerstone of web development, offering a compact binary format that allows high-performance applications to run at near-native speeds in web browsers. Despite its advantages, Wasm’s binary nature presents significant challenges for developers and researchers, particularly regarding readability when debugging or analyzing web applications. Therefore, effective decompilation becomes crucial. Unfortunately, traditional decompilers often struggle with producing readable outputs. While some large language model (LLM)-based decompilers have shown good compatibility with general binary files, they still face specific challenges when dealing with Wasm.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, WaDec, which is the first use of a fine-tuned LLM to interpret and decompile Wasm binary code into a higher-level, more comprehensible source code representation. The LLM was meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of wat-c code snippets, employing self-supervised learning techniques. This enables WaDec to effectively decompile not only complete wat functions but also finer-grained wat code snippets. Our experiments demonstrate that WaDec markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art tools, offering substantial improvements across several metrics. It achieves a code inflation rate of only 3.34\%, a dramatic 97\% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art’s 116.94\%. Unlike the output of baselines that cannot be directly compiled or executed, WaDec maintains a recompilability rate of 52.11\%, a re-execution rate of 43.55\%, and an output consistency of 27.15\%. Additionally, it significantly exceeds state-of-the-art performance in AST edit distance similarity by 185\%, cyclomatic complexity by 8\%, and cosine similarity by 41\%, achieving an average code similarity above 50\%. In summary, WaDec enhances understanding of the code’s structure and execution flow, facilitating automated code analysis, optimization, and security auditing.},

@article{slawinski_applications_2019-1,
  abstract = {We classify .NET files as either benign or malicious by examining directed graphs derived from the set of functions comprising the given file. Each graph is viewed probabilistically as a Markov chain where each node represents a code block of the corresponding function, and by computing the PageRank vector (Perron vector with transport), a probability measure can be defined over the nodes of the given graph. Each graph is vectorized by computing Lebesgue antiderivatives of hand-engineered functions defined on the vertex set of the given graph against the PageRank measure. Files are subsequently vectorized by aggregating the set of vectors corresponding to the set of graphs resulting from decompiling the given file. The result is a fast, intuitive, and easy-to-compute glass-box vectorization scheme, which can be leveraged for training a standalone classifier or to augment an existing feature space. We refer to this vectorization technique as PageRank Measure Integration Vectorization (PMIV). We demonstrate the efficacy of PMIV by training a vanilla random forest on 2.5 million samples of decompiled .NET, evenly split between benign and malicious, from our in-house corpus and compare this model to a baseline model which leverages a text-only feature space. The median time needed for decompilation and scoring was 24ms.},

@article{tehranijamsaz_graphbinmatch_2023,
  abstract = {Matching binary to source code and vice versa has various applications in different fields, such as computer security, software engineering, and reverse engineering. Even though there exist methods that try to match source code with binary code to accelerate the reverse engineering process, most of them are designed to focus on one programming language. However, in real life, programs are developed using different programming languages depending on their requirements. Thus, cross-language binary-to-source code matching has recently gained more attention. Nonetheless, the existing approaches still struggle to have precise predictions due to the inherent difficulties when the problem of matching binary code and source code needs to be addressed across programming languages. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-language binary source code matching. We propose GraphBinMatch, an approach based on a graph neural network that learns the similarity between binary and source codes. We evaluate GraphBinMatch on several tasks, such as cross-language binary-to-source code matching and cross-language source-to-source matching. We also evaluate our approach performance on single-language binary-to-source code matching. Experimental results show that GraphBinMatch outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with improvements as high as 15\% over the F1 score.},

@article{verbeek_formally_2025-2,
  abstract = {Binary-level pointer analysis can be of use in symbolic execution, testing, verification, and decompilation of software binaries. In various such contexts, it is crucial that the result is trustworthy, i.e., it can be formally established that the pointer designations are overapproximative. This paper presents an approach to formally proven correct binary-level pointer analysis. A salient property of our approach is that it first generically considers what proof obligations a generic abstract domain for pointer analysis must satisfy. This allows easy instantiation of different domains, varying in precision, while preserving the correctness of the analysis. In the trade-off between scalability and precision, such customization allows "meaningful" precision (sufficiently precise to ensure basic sanity properties, such as that relevant parts of the stack frame are not overwritten during function execution) while also allowing coarse analysis when pointer computations have become too obfuscated during compilation for sound and accurate bounds analysis. We experiment with three different abstract domains with high, medium, and low precision. Evaluation shows that our approach is able to derive designations for memory writes soundly in COTS binaries, in a context-sensitive interprocedural fashion.},

@article{zhang_novel_2024-1,
  abstract = {With the rapid advancement of Internet technology, the threat of malware to computer systems and network security has intensified. Malware affects individual privacy and security and poses risks to critical infrastructures of enterprises and nations. The increasing quantity and complexity of malware, along with its concealment and diversity, challenge traditional detection techniques. Static detection methods struggle against variants and packed malware, while dynamic methods face high costs and risks that limit their application. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel and efficient malware detection techniques to improve accuracy and robustness. This study first employs the minhash algorithm to convert binary files of malware into grayscale images, followed by the extraction of global and local texture features using GIST and LBP algorithms. Additionally, the study utilizes IDA Pro to decompile and extract opcode sequences, applying N-gram and tf-idf algorithms for feature vectorization. The fusion of these features enables the model to comprehensively capture the behavioral characteristics of malware. In terms of model construction, a CNN-BiLSTM fusion model is designed to simultaneously process image features and opcode sequences, enhancing classification performance. Experimental validation on multiple public datasets demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional detection techniques in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, particularly in detecting variants and obfuscated malware with greater stability. The research presented in this paper offers new insights into the development of malware detection technologies, validating the effectiveness of feature and model fusion, and holds promising application prospects.},
