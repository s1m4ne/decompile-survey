  abstract = {Analysis of binary software plays a critical role in software security. Reverse engineers analyze binaries to discover vulnerabilities, patch legacy software, and detect malware. Most of the reverse engineering tools have been developed from a practical point of view, and do not provide any guarantees with their results. Recently, formally verified reverse engineering and decompilation have gained traction. These formal tools are for the most part proof-of-concept systems not yet suitable for real-world reverse-engineering tasks. In this poster, we explore the idea of formalizing part of an existing decompilation tool instead. We focus on the lifting from assembly to the IR P-Code in one of the most popular decompilers, Ghidra. This step occurs immediately after disassembly. We are developing a proof system inside the Isabelle theorem prover, to automatically prove semantical equivalence between the assembly and P-Code instructions. We leverage machine-learned x86-64 semantics, to stay as close as possible to actual CPU behavior. This approach has uncovered several shortcomings in Ghidra's P-Code and the lifting it performs. By using a theorem prover, we obtain guarantees that our system of formal semantics and lifting is internally consistent. This work brings the powerful guarantees that formal methods provide in reverse engineering research to the real world.},

  abstract = {Recovering function signatures is a cornerstone of binary program analysis, yet it remains a challenging task. Existing methods either rely on disassembly-based constraints, which struggle with cross-architecture compatibility and scalability, or adopt learning-based approaches that are resource-intensive and often inaccurate. In this paper, we present CDA, a novel decompilation-based method for recovering function signatures that combines the strengths of multiple decompilers while mitigating their limitations. The core idea behind CDA is leveraging probabilistic constraints to estimate the likelihood of each function signature recovery result produced by decompilers, guided by inference rules specifically designed to address the limitations of decompilers. Based on these probabilities, CDA selects the recovery results with the highest likelihood as the final outcomes. We extensively evaluate CDA across five tasks --- variadic function/position detection, parameter identification, return value detection, and parameter type recovery --- comparing it against state-of-the-art tools, including IDA, Ghidra, Binary Ninja, and TYGR. Experimental results show that CDA outperforms baseline tools across multiple architectures (x64, x86, AArch64, Arm, and Mips) and optimization levels (O0-O3), highlighting its robustness and reliability in diverse compilation environments.},

@article{Jiang2025,
  abstract = {Binary code analysis is the foundation of crucial tasks in the security domain; thus building effective binary analysis techniques is more important than ever. Large language models (LLMs) although have brought impressive improvement to source code tasks, do not directly generalize to assembly code due to the unique challenges of assembly: (1) the low information density of assembly and (2) the diverse optimizations in assembly code. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code. Nova outperforms existing techniques on binary code decompilation by up to 14.84 -- 21.58% (absolute percentage point improvement) higher Pass@1 and Pass@10, and outperforms the latest binary code similarity detection techniques by up to 6.17% Recall@1, showing promising abilities on both assembly generation and understanding tasks. },
