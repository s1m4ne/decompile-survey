  abstract = {Decompilation is a well-studied area with numerous high-quality tools available. These are frequently used for security tasks and to port legacy code. However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. However, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect. This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompiler based on a sequence-to-sequence transformer trained over real-world code. We develop a novel tokenizer and exploit no-dropout training to produce high-quality code. We utilize type-inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code. We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 functions from ExeBench on two ISAs and at two optimizations levels. SLaDe is up to 6 times more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4 times more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both. },

  abstract = {Decompilation is the procedure of transforming binary programs into a high-level representation, such as source code, for human analysts to examine. While modern decompilers can reconstruct and recover much information that is discarded during compilation, inferring variable names is still extremely difficult. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing, we propose a novel solution to infer variable names in decompiled code based on Masked Language Modeling, Byte-Pair Encoding, and neural architectures such as Transformers and BERT. Our solution takes \textit\{raw\} decompiler output, the less semantically meaningful code, as input, and enriches it using our proposed \textit\{finetuning\} technique, Constrained Masked Language Modeling. Using Constrained Masked Language Modeling introduces the challenge of predicting the number of masked tokens for the original variable name. We address this \textit\{count of token prediction\} challenge with our post-processing algorithm. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our trained VarBERT model is simpler and of much better performance. We evaluated our model on an existing large-scale data set with 164,632 binaries and showed that it can predict variable names identical to the ones present in the original source code up to 84.15\% of the time. },

  abstract = {Decompilation aims to transform a low-level program language (LPL) (eg., binary file) into its functionally-equivalent high-level program language (HPL) (e.g., C/C++). It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks. },

  abstract = {The vision of Web3 is to improve user control over data and assets, but one challenge that complicates this vision is the prevalence of non-transparent, scam-prone applications and vulnerable smart contracts that put Web3 users at risk. While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code with prompt engineering. Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 73.33% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance, suggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs continue to advance. In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, improving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart contracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3 projects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD. MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education. It empowers users to easily and independently review and audit non-open-source smart contracts, fostering accountability and decentralization },

This opacity necessitates the automated semantic analysis of on-chain smart contract bytecode, a fundamental research challenge with direct implications for identifying vulnerabilities and understanding malicious behavior. Prevailing decompilers struggle to reverse bytecode in a readable manner, often yielding convoluted code that critically hampers vulnerability analysis and thwarts efforts to dissect contract functionalities for security auditing. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a pioneering decompilation pipeline that, for the first time, successfully leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into human-readable and semantically faithful Solidity code. Our novel methodology first employs rigorous static program analysis to convert bytecode into a structured three-address code (TAC) representation. This intermediate representation then guides a Llama-3.2-3B model, specifically fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset of 238,446 TAC-to-Solidity function pairs, to generate high-quality Solidity. This approach uniquely recovers meaningful variable names, intricate control flow, and precise function signatures. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates a significant leap beyond traditional decompilers, achieving an average semantic similarity of 0.82 with original source and markedly superior readability. The practical viability and effectiveness of our research are demonstrated through its implementation in a publicly accessible system, available at https://evmdecompiler.com. },

(2) Fine-grained Alignment Enhancement (FAE), which meticulously aligns assembly code with source code at the statement level by leveraging debugging information, is employed during the fine-tuning phase to achieve further improvements in decompilation. By integrating these two methods, we achieved a Re-Executability performance improvement of approximately 3.90% on the Decompile-Eval benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance of 52.41%.

On the one hand, malicious parties may recover interpretable source codes from the software products to gain commercial advantages. On the other hand, binary decompilation can be leveraged for code vulnerability analysis and malware detection. However, efficient binary decompilation is challenging. Conventional decompilers have the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To address the above problems, we propose Coda, the first end-to-end neural-based framework for code decompilation. Coda decomposes the decompilation task into two key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a tree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention feeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches. We assess Coda's performance with extensive experiments on various benchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82\% program recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-art decompilers yield 0\% accuracy. Furthermore, Coda outperforms the sequence-to-sequence model with attention by a margin of 70\% program accuracy. },

Recently, researchers have proposed using techniques from neural machine translation to automate the process in decompilation. Although such techniques hold the promise of targeting a wider range of source and assembly languages, to date they have primarily targeted C code. In this paper we argue that existing neural decompilers have achieved higher accuracy at the cost of requiring language-specific domain knowledge such as tokenizers and parsers to build an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the source language, which increases the overhead of supporting new languages. We explore a different tradeoff that, to the extent possible, treats the assembly and source languages as plain text, and show that this allows us to build a decompiler that is easily retargetable to new languages. We evaluate our prototype decompiler, Beyond The C (BTC), on Go, Fortran, OCaml, and C, and examine the impact of parameters such as tokenization and training data selection on the quality of decompilation, finding that it achieves comparable decompilation results to prior work in neural decompilation with significantly less domain knowledge.

The problem of decompilation is extremely important for security researchers. Finding vulnerabilities and understanding how malware operates is much easier when done over source code. The importance of decompilation has motivated the construction of hand-crafted rule-based decompilers. Such decompilers have been designed by experts to detect specific control-flow structures and idioms in low-level code and lift them to source level. The cost of supporting additional languages or new language features in these models is very high. We present a novel approach to decompilation based on neural machine translation. The main idea is to automatically learn a decompiler from a given compiler. Given a compiler from a source language S to a target language T , our approach automatically trains a decompiler that can translate (decompile) T back to S . We used our framework to decompile both LLVM IR and x86 assembly to C code with high success rates. Using our LLVM and x86 instantiations, we were able to successfully decompile over 97% and 88% of our benchmarks respectively. },

It has been widely used when analysts perform security analysis on software (systems) whose source code is unavailable, such as vulnerability search and malware analysis. However, current decompilation tools usually need lots of experts' efforts, even for years, to generate the rules for decompilation, which also requires long-term maintenance as the syntax of high-level PL or low-level PL changes. Also, an ideal decompiler should concisely generate high-level PL with similar functionality to the source low-level PL and semantic information (e.g., meaningful variable names), just like human-written code. Unfortunately, existing manually-defined rule-based decompilation techniques only functionally restore the low-level PL to a similar high-level PL and are still powerless to recover semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel neural decompilation approach to translate low-level PL into accurate and user-friendly high-level PL, effectively improving its readability and understandability. Furthermore, we implement the proposed approaches called SEAM. Evaluations on four real-world applications show that SEAM has an average accuracy of 94.41%, which is much better than prior neural machine translation (NMT) models.

In particular, the bottleneck of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate method identification, incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically, \system\{\} constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance, achieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable types, and 80.65% for contract attributes. },

We present BTD (Bin to DNN), a decompiler for deep neural network (DNN) executables. BTD takes DNN executables and outputs full model specifications, including types of DNN operators, network topology, dimensions, and parameters that are (nearly) identical to those of the input models. BTD delivers a practical framework to process DNN executables compiled by different DL compilers and with full optimizations enabled on x86 platforms. It employs learning-based techniques to infer DNN operators, dynamic analysis to reveal network architectures, and symbolic execution to facilitate inferring dimensions and parameters of DNN operators. Our evaluation reveals that BTD enables accurate recovery of full specifications of complex DNNs with millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet). The recovered DNN specifications can be re-compiled into a new DNN executable exhibiting identical behavior to the input executable. We show that BTD can boost two representative attacks, adversarial example generation and knowledge stealing, against DNN executables.

To address these issues, we develop the CodeInverter Suite, making three contributions: (1) the CodeInverter Workflow (CIW) is a novel prompt engineering workflow that incorporates control flow graphs (CFG) and explicit data mappings to improve LLM-based decompilation. (2) Using CIW on well-known source code datasets, we curate the CodeInverter Dataset (CID), a domain-specific dataset containing 8.69 million samples that contains CFGs and data mapping tables.

  abstract = {WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) has emerged as a cornerstone of web development, offering a compact binary format that allows high-performance applications to run at near-native speeds in web browsers. Despite its advantages, Wasm's binary nature presents significant challenges for developers and researchers, particularly regarding readability when debugging or analyzing web applications. Therefore, effective decompilation becomes crucial. Unfortunately, traditional decompilers often struggle with producing readable outputs. While some large language model (LLM)-based decompilers have shown good compatibility with general binary files, they still face specific challenges when dealing with Wasm. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, WaDec, which is the first use of a fine-tuned LLM to interpret and decompile Wasm binary code into a higher-level, more comprehensible source code representation. The LLM was meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of wat-c code snippets, employing self-supervised learning techniques. This enables WaDec to effectively decompile not only complete wat functions but also finer-grained wat code snippets. Our experiments demonstrate that WaDec markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art tools, offering substantial improvements across several metrics. It achieves a code inflation rate of only 3.34%, a dramatic 97% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art's 116.94%. Unlike baselines' output that cannot be directly compiled or executed, WaDec maintains a recompilability rate of 52.11%, a re-execution rate of 43.55%, and an output consistency of 27.15%. Additionally, it significantly exceeds state-of-the-art performance in AST edit distance similarity by 185%, cyclomatic complexity by 8%, and cosine similarity by 41%, achieving an average code similarity above 50%. },

  abstract = {Decompilation aims to convert binary code to high-level source code, but traditional tools like Ghidra often produce results that are difficult to read and execute. Motivated by the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose LLM4Decompile, the first and largest open-source LLM series (1.3B to 33B) trained to decompile binary code. We optimize the LLM training process and introduce the LLM4Decompile-End models to decompile binary directly. The resulting models significantly outperform GPT-4o and Ghidra on the HumanEval and ExeBench benchmarks by over 100% in terms of re-executability rate. Additionally, we improve the standard refinement approach to fine-tune the LLM4Decompile-Ref models, enabling them to effectively refine the decompiled code from Ghidra and achieve a further 16.2% improvement over the LLM4Decompile-End. LLM4Decompile demonstrates the potential of LLMs to revolutionize binary code decompilation, delivering remarkable improvements in readability and executability while complementing conventional tools for optimal results.

@article{Wong2023,
  abstract = {A C decompiler converts an executable into source code. The recovered C source code, once re-compiled, is expected to produce an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. With over twenty years of development, C decompilers have been widely used in production to support reverse engineering applications. Despite the prosperous development of C decompilers, it is widely acknowledged that decompiler outputs are mainly used for human consumption, and are not suitable for automatic recompilation. Often, a substantial amount of manual effort is required to fix the decompiler outputs before they can be recompiled and executed properly. This paper is motived by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in comprehending dense corpus of natural language. To alleviate the tedious, costly and often error-prone manual effort in fixing decompiler outputs, we investigate the feasibility of using LLMs to augment decompiler outputs, thus delivering recompilable decompilation. Note that different from previous efforts that focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with higher readability (e.g., recovering type/variable names), we focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with recompilability, meaning to generate code that can be recompiled into an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. We conduct a pilot study to characterize the obstacles in recompiling the outputs of the de facto commercial C decompiler -- IDA-Pro. We then propose a two-step, hybrid approach to augmenting decompiler outputs with LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a set of popular C test cases, and show that our approach can deliver a high recompilation success rate to over 75% with moderate effort, whereas none of the IDA-Pro's original outputs can be recompiled. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations of our approach and promising future research directions. },

  abstract = {Decompilation aims to recover the source code form of a binary executable. It has many security applications, such as malware analysis, vulnerability detection, and code hardening. A prominent challenge in decompilation is to recover variable names. We propose a novel technique that leverages the strengths of generative models while mitigating model biases. We build a prototype, GenNm, from pre-trained generative models CodeGemma-2B, CodeLlama-7B, and CodeLlama-34B. We finetune GenNm on decompiled functions and teach models to leverage contextual information. GenNm includes names from callers and callees while querying a function, providing rich contextual information within the model's input token limitation. We mitigate model biases by aligning the output distribution of models with symbol preferences of developers. Our results show that GenNm improves the state-of-the-art name recovery precision by 5.6-11.4 percentage points on two commonly used datasets and improves the state-of-the-art by 32% (from 17.3% to 22.8%) in the most challenging setup where ground-truth variable names are not seen in the training dataset. },

  abstract = {As one of the key tools in many security tasks, decompilers reconstruct human-readable source code from binaries. Yet, despite recent advances, their outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and remain difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanced decompiler-LLM pipeline with a fine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: preserving accuracy while improving readability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality assessment system to score the decompiled source code from multiple aspects, and use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best output during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the quality of 68.2% of all the functions produced by the native decompiler. },
