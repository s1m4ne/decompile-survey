  abstract = {The decompiler is one of the most common tools for examining binaries without corresponding source code. It transforms binaries into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Decompilers can reconstruct much of the information that is lost during the compilation process (e.g., structure and type information). Unfortunately, they do not reconstruct semantically meaningful variable names, which are known to increase code understandability. We propose the Decompiled Identifier Renaming Engine (DIRE), a novel probabilistic technique for variable name recovery that uses both lexical and structural information recovered by the decompiler. We also present a technique for generating corpora suitable for training and evaluating models of decompiled code renaming, which we use to create a corpus of 164,632 unique x86-64 binaries generated from C projects mined from GitHub.1 Our results show that on this corpus DIRE can predict variable names identical to the names in the original source code up to 74.3% of the time.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a widely used process for reverse engineers to significantly enhance code readability by lifting assembly code to a higher-level C-like language, pseudo-code. Nevertheless, the process of compilation and stripping irreversibly discards high-level semantic information that is crucial to code comprehension, such as comments, identifier names, and types. Existing approaches typically recover only one type of information, making them suboptimal for semantic inference. In this paper, we treat pseudo-code as a special programming language, then present a unified pre-trained model, HexT5, that is trained on vast amounts of natural language comments, source identifiers, and pseudo-code using novel pseudo-code-based pretraining objectives. We fine-tune HexT5 on various downstream tasks, including code summarization, variable name recovery, function name recovery, and similarity detection. Comprehensive experiments show that HexT5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on four downstream tasks, and it demonstrates the robust effectiveness and generalizability of HexT5 for binary-related tasks.},

  abstract = {When code is compiled, information is lost, including some of the structure of the original source code as well as local identifier names. Existing decompilers can reconstruct much of the original source code, but typically use meaningless placeholder variables for identifier names. Using variable names which are more natural in the given context can make the code much easier to interpret, despite the fact that variable names have no effect on the execution of the program. In theory, it is impossible to recover the original identifier names since that information has been lost. However, most code is natural: it is highly repetitive and predictable based on the context. In this paper we propose a technique that assigns variables meaningful names by taking advantage of this naturalness property. We consider decompiler output to be a noisy distortion of the original source code, where the original source code is transformed into the decompiler output. Using this noisy channel model, we apply standard statistical machine translation approaches to choose natural identifiers, combining a translation model trained on a parallel corpus with a language model trained on unmodified C code. We generate a large parallel corpus from 1.2 TB of C source code obtained from GitHub. Under the most conservative assumptions, our technique is still able to recover the original variable names up to 16.2% of the time, which represents a lower bound for performance.},

  abstract = {Recovering function signatures is a cornerstone of binary program analysis, yet it remains a challenging task. Existing methods either rely on disassembly-based constraints, which struggle with cross-architecture compatibility and scalability, or adopt learning-based approaches that are resource-intensive and often inaccurate. In this paper, we present CDA, a novel decompilation-based method for recovering function signatures that combines the strengths of multiple decompilers while mitigating their limitations. The core idea behind CDA is leveraging probabilistic constraints to estimate the likelihood of each function signature recovery result produced by decompilers, guided by inference rules specifically designed to address the limitations of decompilers. Based on these probabilities, CDA selects the recovery results with the highest likelihood as the final outcomes. We extensively evaluate CDA across five tasks --- variadic function/position detection, parameter identification, return value detection, and parameter type recovery --- comparing it against state-of-the-art tools, including IDA, Ghidra, Binary Ninja, and TYGR. Experimental results show that CDA outperforms baseline tools across multiple architectures (x64, x86, AArch64, Arm, and Mips) and optimization levels (O0-O3), highlighting its robustness and reliability in diverse compilation environments.},

  abstract = {Modern industry is built, among other things, on software, the presence of vulnerabilities in which is a significant problem. It is more rational to search for vulnerabilities in those representations of the program (source code, algorithms, architecture, etc.) on the basis of which they were developed. However, as a rule, there is difficult-to-analyze machine code available. Obtaining higher-level representations is possible by reverse engineering, carried out in various ways, such as expert, algorithmic, intelligent, enumeration and logging. The qualitative comparison of these representations is given. The current study is devoted to a new method of reverse engineering based on the use of genetic algorithms. The course of the research and the following main scientific results are briefly described: the methodology of reverse engineering of a software system, the model of the life cycle of a program with multi-level vulnerabilities, the concept of genetic de-evolution of program representations, scientific, methodological and algorithmic instrumentation for genetic decompilation, an architectural block for conducting genetic de-evolution of representations with functionality for searching for multi-level vulnerabilities. All results are novel, as well as theoretically and practically significant.},

  abstract = {Decompilers are widely used by security researchers and developers to reverse engineer executable code. While modern decompilers are adept at recovering instructions, control flow, and function boundaries, some useful information from the original source code, such as variable types and names, is lost during the compilation process. Our work aims to predict these variable types and names from the remaining information. We propose STRIDE, a lightweight technique that predicts variable names and types by matching sequences of decompiler tokens to those found in training data. We evaluate it on three benchmark datasets and find that STRIDE achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art machine learning models for both variable retyping and renaming while being much simpler and faster. We perform a detailed comparison with two recent SOTA transformer-based models in order to understand the specific factors that make our technique effective. We implemented STRIDE in fewer than 1000 lines of Python and have open-sourced it under a permissive license at https://github.com/hgarrereyn/STRIDE. },

  abstract = {Recent advances in LLM-based decompilers have been shown effective to convert low-level binaries into human-readable source code. However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLM decompilation technology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Decompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmark Decompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues. We further explore commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide a thorough assessment of the studied LLM decompilers and find that fine-tuning with Decompile-Bench causes a 20% improvement over previous benchmarks in terms of the re-executability rate.

  abstract = {Deep learning methods are gaining popularity in different application
domains, and especially in natural language processing. It is commonly
believed that using a large enough dataset and an adequate network
architecture, almost any processing problem can be solved. A frequent
and widely used typology is the encoder-decoder architecture, where the
input data is transformed into an intermediate code by means of an
encoder, and then a decoder takes this code to produce its output.
Different types of networks can be used in the encoder and the decoder,
depending on the problem of interest, such as convolutional neural
networks (CNN) or long-short term memories (LSTM). This paper uses for
the encoder a method recently proposed, called Causal Feature Extractor
(CFE). It is based on causal convolutions (i.e., convolutions that
depend only on one direction of the input), dilatation (i.e., increasing
the aperture size of the convolutions) and bidirectionality (i.e.,
independent networks in both directions). Some preliminary results are
presented on three different tasks and compared with state-of-the-art
methods: bilingual translation, LaTeX decompilation and audio
transcription. The proposed method achieves promising results, showing
its ubiquity to work with text, audio and images. Moreover, it has a
shorter training time, requiring less time per iteration, and a good use
of the attention mechanisms based on attention matrices.},

  abstract = {Cybersecurity attacks on embedded devices for industrial control systems
and cyber-physical systems may cause catastrophic physical damage as
well as economic loss. This could be achieved by infecting device
binaries with malware that modifies the physical characteristics of the
system operation. Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse
engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of
mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional
reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but
offer little semantic insight. This article proposes the REMaQE
automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from
binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles
equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or
pointers, and can reverse engineer equations from object-oriented
implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug
in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool ``tmon.{''} To evaluate
REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations
implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a
semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes
in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations.
Real-time execution enables integration in an interactive math-oriented
reverse engineering workflow.},
