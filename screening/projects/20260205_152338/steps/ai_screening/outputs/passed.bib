  abstract = {The decompiler is one of the most common tools for examining binaries without corresponding source code. It transforms binaries into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Decompilers can reconstruct much of the information that is lost during the compilation process (e.g., structure and type information). Unfortunately, they do not reconstruct semantically meaningful variable names, which are known to increase code understandability. We propose the Decompiled Identifier Renaming Engine (DIRE), a novel probabilistic technique for variable name recovery that uses both lexical and structural information recovered by the decompiler. We also present a technique for generating corpora suitable for training and evaluating models of decompiled code renaming, which we use to create a corpus of 164,632 unique x86-64 binaries generated from C projects mined from GitHub.1 Our results show that on this corpus DIRE can predict variable names identical to the names in the original source code up to 74.3% of the time.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a widely used process for reverse engineers to significantly enhance code readability by lifting assembly code to a higher-level C-like language, pseudo-code. Nevertheless, the process of compilation and stripping irreversibly discards high-level semantic information that is crucial to code comprehension, such as comments, identifier names, and types. Existing approaches typically recover only one type of information, making them suboptimal for semantic inference. In this paper, we treat pseudo-code as a special programming language, then present a unified pre-trained model, HexT5, that is trained on vast amounts of natural language comments, source identifiers, and pseudo-code using novel pseudo-code-based pretraining objectives. We fine-tune HexT5 on various downstream tasks, including code summarization, variable name recovery, function name recovery, and similarity detection. Comprehensive experiments show that HexT5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on four downstream tasks, and it demonstrates the robust effectiveness and generalizability of HexT5 for binary-related tasks.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a well-studied area with numerous high-quality tools available. These are frequently used for security tasks and to port legacy code. However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. Nevertheless, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect.This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompiler based on a sequence-to-sequence Transformer trained over real-world code and augmented with a type inference engine. We utilize a novel tokenizer, dropout-free regularization, and type inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code.We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 ExeBench functions on two ISAs and at two optimization levels. SLaDe is up to 6\texttimes{} more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4\texttimes{} more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both.},

  abstract = {When code is compiled, information is lost, including some of the structure of the original source code as well as local identifier names. Existing decompilers can reconstruct much of the original source code, but typically use meaningless placeholder variables for identifier names. Using variable names which are more natural in the given context can make the code much easier to interpret, despite the fact that variable names have no effect on the execution of the program. In theory, it is impossible to recover the original identifier names since that information has been lost. However, most code is natural: it is highly repetitive and predictable based on the context. In this paper we propose a technique that assigns variables meaningful names by taking advantage of this naturalness property. We consider decompiler output to be a noisy distortion of the original source code, where the original source code is transformed into the decompiler output. Using this noisy channel model, we apply standard statistical machine translation approaches to choose natural identifiers, combining a translation model trained on a parallel corpus with a language model trained on unmodified C code. We generate a large parallel corpus from 1.2 TB of C source code obtained from GitHub. Under the most conservative assumptions, our technique is still able to recover the original variable names up to 16.2% of the time, which represents a lower bound for performance.},

Second, a decompilation-into-logic methodology supporting both x86-64 assembly and machine code at large scale. This work enables black-box binary verification, i.e., formal verification of a binary where source code is unavailable. As such, it can be applied to safety-critical systems that consist of legacy components, or components whose source code is unavailable due to proprietary reasons. The methodology minimizes the trusted code base by leveraging machine-learned semantics to build a formal machine model. We apply the methodology to several case studies, including binaries that heavily rely on the SSE2 floating-point instruction set, and binaries that are obtained by compiling code that is obtained by inlining assembly into C code.},

Most of the reverse engineering tools have been developed from a practical point of view, and do not provide any guarantees with their results. Recently, formally verified reverse engineering and decompilation have gained traction. These formal tools are for the most part proof-of-concept systems not yet suitable for real-world reverse-engineering tasks. In this poster, we explore the idea of formalizing part of an existing decompilation tool instead. We focus on the lifting from assembly to the IR P-Code in one of the most popular decompilers, Ghidra. This step occurs immediately after disassembly. We are developing a proof system inside the Isabelle theorem prover, to automatically prove semantical equivalence between the assembly and P-Code instructions. We leverage machine-learned x86-64 semantics, to stay as close as possible to actual CPU behavior. This approach has uncovered several shortcomings in Ghidra's P-Code and the lifting it performs. By using a theorem prover, we obtain guarantees that our system of formal semantics and lifting is internally consistent. This work brings the powerful guarantees that formal methods provide in reverse engineering research to the real world.},

  abstract = {WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) has emerged as a cornerstone of web development, offering a compact binary format that allows high-performance applications to run at near-native speeds in web browsers. Despite its advantages, Wasm's binary nature presents significant challenges for developers and researchers, particularly regarding readability when debugging or analyzing web applications. Therefore, effective decompilation becomes crucial. Unfortunately, traditional decompilers often struggle with producing readable outputs. While some large language model (LLM)-based decompilers have shown good compatibility with general binary files, they still face specific challenges when dealing with Wasm.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, WaDec, which is the first use of a fine-tuned LLM to interpret and decompile Wasm binary code into a higher-level, more comprehensible source code representation. The LLM was meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of wat-c code snippets, employing self-supervised learning techniques. This enables WaDec to effectively decompile not only complete wat functions but also finer-grained wat code snippets. Our experiments demonstrate that WaDec markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art tools, offering substantial improvements across several metrics. It achieves a code inflation rate of only 3.34%, a dramatic 97% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art's 116.94%. Unlike the output of baselines that cannot be directly compiled or executed, WaDec maintains a recompilability rate of 52.11%, a re-execution rate of 43.55%, and an output consistency of 27.15%. Additionally, it significantly exceeds state-of-the-art performance in AST edit distance similarity by 185%, cyclomatic complexity by 8%, and cosine similarity by 41%, achieving an average code similarity above 50%. In summary, WaDec enhances understanding of the code's structure and execution flow, facilitating automated code analysis, optimization, and security auditing.},

  abstract = {The vision of Web3 is to improve user control over data and assets, but one challenge that complicates this vision is the prevalence of non-transparent, scam-prone applications and vulnerable smart contracts that put Web3 users at risk. While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code with prompt engineering. Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 73.33% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance, suggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs continue to advance. In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, improving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart contracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3 projects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD. MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education. It empowers users to easily and independently review and audit non-open-source smart contracts, fostering accountability and decentralization. Moreover, MAD's methodology could potentially extend to other smart contract languages, like Solidity, further enhancing Web3 transparency.},

  abstract = {Decompilers are widely used in reverse engineering (RE) to convert compiled executables into human-readable pseudocode and support various security analysis tasks. Existing decompilers, such as IDA Pro and Ghidra, focus on enhancing the readability of decompiled code rather than its recompilability, which limits further programmatic use, such as for CodeQL-based vulnerability analysis that requires compilable versions of the decompiled code. Recent LLM-based approaches for enhancing decompilation results, while useful for human RE analysts, unfortunately also follow the same path.    In this paper, we explore, for the first time, how off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) can be used to enable recompilable decompilation—automatically correcting decompiler outputs into compilable versions. We first show that this is non-trivial through a pilot study examining existing rule-based and LLM-based approaches. Based on the lessons learned, we design DecLLM, an iterative LLM-based repair loop that utilizes both static recompilation and dynamic runtime feedback as oracles to iteratively fix decompiler outputs. We test DecLLM on popular C benchmarks and real-world binaries using two mainstream LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and show that off-the-shelf LLMs can achieve an upper bound of around 70% recompilation success rate, i.e., 70 out of 100 originally non-recompilable decompiler outputs are now recompilable. We also demonstrate the practical applicability of the recompilable code for CodeQL-based vulnerability analysis, which is impossible to perform directly on binaries. For the remaining 30% of hard cases, we further delve into their errors to gain insights for future improvements in decompilation-oriented LLM design.},

In this paper, we propose DiSCo, the first LLMs-based EVM decompilation pipeline, which aims to enable LLMs to understand the opaque bytecode and lift it into smart contract code. DiSCo introduces three core technologies. First, a logic-invariant intermediate representation is proposed to reproject the low-level bytecode into high-level abstracted units. The second technique involves semantic enhancement based on a novel type-aware graph model to infer stripped variables during compilation, enhancing the lifting effect. The third technology is a flexible method incorporating code specifications to construct LLM-comprehensible prompts for source code generation. Extensive experiments illustrate that our generated code guarantees a high compilability rate at 75%, with differential fuzzing pass rate averaging at 50%. Manual validation results further indicate that the generated solidity contracts significantly outperforms baseline methods in tasks such as code comprehension and attack reproduction.},

  abstract = {Analysis of binary executables implementing mathematical equations can benefit from the reverse engineering of semantic information about the implementation. Traditional algorithmic reverse engineering tools either do not recover semantic information or rely on dynamic analysis and symbolic execution with high reverse engineering time. Algorithmic tools also require significant re-engineering effort to target new platforms and languages. Recently, neural methods for decompilation have been developed to recover human-like source code, but they do not extract semantic information explicitly. We develop REMEND, a neural decompilation framework to reverse engineer math equations from binaries to explicitly recover program semantics like data flow and order of operations. REMEND combines a transformer encoder-decoder model for neural decompilation with algorithmic processing for enhanced symbolic reasoning necessary for math equations. REMEND is the first work to demonstrate that transformers for neural decompilation go beyond source code and reason about program semantics in the form of math equations. We train on a synthetically generated dataset containing multiple implementations and compilations of math equations to produce a robust neural decompilation model and demonstrate retargettability. REMEND obtains an accuracy of 89.8% to 92.4% across three Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), three optimization levels, and two programming languages with a single trained model, extending the capability of state-of-the-art neural decompilers. We achieve high accuracy with a small model of upto 12 million parameters and an average execution time of 0.132 seconds per function. On a real-world dataset collected from open-source programs, REMEND generalizes better than state-of-the-art neural decompilers despite being trained with synthetic data, achieving 8% higher accuracy.

We extend the original DIRTY results by re-training the DIRTY model on a dataset produced by the open-source Ghidra decompiler. Although Chen et al. concluded that Ghidra was not a suitable decompiler candidate due to its difficulty in parsing and incorporating DWARF symbols during analysis, we demonstrate that straightforward parsing of variable data generated by Ghidra results in similar retyping performance.

One issue that arises during genetic reverse engineering is predicting the size of the source code based on its machine representation (i.e., in an object or executable file). The article is devoted to solving this problem for functions in the C programming language. To do this, a method for obtaining a relationship between the sizes of the source and machine code of individual functions is described, which consists of steps such as loading a dataset with C-functions, isolating the function code in it, preprocessing them, compiling them into machine code, calculating the required sizes, building dependencies between each source code size and the corresponding machine code sizes, generating the final table and determining the dependency formula. An experiment is carried out using a software prototype that implements the method; ExeBench with 83 thousand C-functions is taken as a dataset.

However, the state-of-the-art systems, DIRE and DIRTY, generalize poorly to functions in the testing set that are not included in the training set—31.8% for DIRE on DIRTY’s data set and 36.9% for DIRTY on DIRTY’s data set.In this paper, we present VarBERT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to predict meaningful variable names in decompilation output. An advantage of VarBERT is that we can pre-train on human source code and then fine-tune the model to the task of predicting variable names. We also create a new data set VarCorpus, which significantly expands the size and variety of the data set. Our evaluation of VarBERT on VarCorpus, demonstrates a significant improvement in predicting the developer’s original variable names for O2 optimized binaries achieving accuracies of 54.43% for IDA and 54.49% for Ghidra. VarBERT is strictly better than state-of-the-art techniques: On a subset of VarCorpus, VarBERT could predict the developer’s original variable names 50.70% of the time, while DIRE and DIRTY predicted original variable names 35.94% and 38.00% of the time, respectively.},

  abstract = {Python is one of the most popular programming languages among both industry developers and malware authors. Despite demand for Python decompilers, community efforts to maintain automatic Python decompilation tools have been hindered by Python's aggressive language improvements and unstable bytecode specification. Every year, language features are added, code generation undergoes significant changes, and opcodes are added, deleted, and modified. Our research aims to integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with classical Programming Language (PL) theory to create a Python decompiler that accomodates evolving language features and changes to the bytecode specification with minimal human maintenance effort. PyLINGUAL plugs in data-driven NLP components to a version-agnostic core to automatically absorb superficial bytecode and compiler changes, while leveraging programmatic components for abstract control flow reconstruction. To establish trust in the decompilation results, we introduce a stringent correctness measure based on “perfect decompilation”, a statically verifiable refinement of semantic equivalence. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with extensive real-world datasets of benign and malicious Python source code and their corresponding compiled PYC binaries. Our research makes three major contributions: (1) we present PyLINGUAL, a scalable, data-driven decompilation framework with state-of-the-art support for Python versions 3.6 through 3.12, improving the perfect decompilation rate by an average of 45% over the best results of existing decompiler across four datasets; (2) we provide a Python decompiler evaluation framework that verifies decompilation results with perfect decompilation; and (3) we launch PyLINGUAL as a public online service.},

However, the critical task of analyzing optimized, low-level PTX code for performance tuning or understanding poses significant challenges. While LLMs hold promise for PTX-to-CUDA de-compilation to improve code intelligibility, their effectiveness is severely limited by the scarcity of aligned training data and the inherent complexity of highly optimized, unrolled PTX code.In this work, we explore methodologies to significantly enhance LLM capabilities for accurate and readable PTX-to-CUDA decompilation and present PtxDec, a decompilation prototype implementing our approach. To overcome the critical barrier of data scarcity, we develop a compiler-based data augmentation framework coupled with rigorous post-processing, enabling the creation of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of 400K aligned CUDA-PTX kernel pairs for effective LLM training. Furthermore, to empower LLMs to handle the complexity of optimized PTX, we introduce Rolled-PTX—an intermediate representation generated through heuristic loop rerolling during preprocessing. Rolled-PTX condenses unrolled patterns, drastically simplifying the input structure presented to the LLM and aligning it better with higher-level loop constructs.Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PtxDec achieves substantial performance gains: our approach yields a 2.3×–3.1× improvement in functional accuracy over baseline methods, alongside significant enhancements in generated code readability and scheduling consistency with the original optimized kernels. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed component to the overall performance.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work tackling PTX-to-CUDA decompilation, specifically focusing on and demonstrating effective strategies for augmenting LLMs to overcome the key challenges in this domain.},

Existing research primarily focuses on recovering symbolic information in pseudocode, such as function names, variable names, and data types, but neglecting structural information. We observe that even when symbolic information is fully preserved, severe and complex structure distortions remain in the pseudocode, greatly impairing code readability and comprehension. In this work, we first systematically investigate structure distortions in decompiled pseudocode, revealing their variation patterns through quantitative analysis. Using open coding, we derive a taxonomy comprising six top-level categories of structure distortions. Building upon this taxonomy, we propose PseudoFix, a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-based in-context learning. PseudoFix employs semantic retrieval to select the most relevant few-shot examples that provide structure distortion knowledge, and combines this with the well-structured coding patterns learned by LLMs from vast source code repositories, to efficiently refactor distorted pseudocode. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PseudoFix significantly improves pseudocode readability, achieving up to a 34% reduction in Halstead Complexity Effort and a 105% increase in BLEU-4 score. Notably, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both temporary variable elimination and goto statement removal tasks. Additionally, human evaluations yield consistently positive feedback from users across readability, consistency, and reasonability.},

  abstract = {Decompilation plays a critical role in firmware analysis and reverse engineering by enabling the recovery of high-level source code from binary executables. However, existing neural decompilation models often face challenges due to the semantic gap between assembly code and high-level languages, and they typically require large-scale models that impose significant computational demands. In this paper, we propose DECodeT5, a lightweight and efficient neural decompilation method for the C language. DECodeT5 builds upon the CodeT5 code generation model by integrating a pre-trained assembly encoder in place of its original embedding layer. This modification allows for more effective semantic learning from assembly code, improving the model’s ability to capture the intricacies of assembly-to-source code mapping. The architecture of DECodeT5 not only accelerates convergence during end-to-end decompilation tasks but also supports rapid adaptation across different compilers and instruction set architectures (ISAs) by swapping out the encoder module as needed. Our experimental evaluation on the HumanEval and Exebench benchmarks reveals that DECodeT5 significantly improves semantic recovery accuracy, outperforming Ghidra by over 83% and LLM4Decompile by more than 43% in terms of execution recovery. Furthermore, DECodeT5 maintains a compact model size of only 360M parameters, providing inference speeds that are twice as fast as LLM4Decompile. These results underscore DECodeT5’s suitability for deployment in resource-constrained environments and its flexibility in adapting to real-world reverse engineering scenarios, offering a practical solution for modern firmware analysis and security tasks.},

  abstract = {Decompilation, recovering source code from binary, is useful in many situations where it is necessary to analyze or understand software for which source code is not available. Source code is much easier for humans to read than binary code, and there are many tools available to analyze source code. Existing decompilation techniques often generate source code that is difficult for humans to understand because the generated code often does not use the coding idioms that programmers use. Differences from human-written code also reduce the effectiveness of analysis tools on the decompiled source code. To address the problem of differences between decompiled code and human-written code, we present a novel technique for decompiling binary code snippets using a model based on Recurrent Neural Networks. The model learns properties and patterns that occur in source code and uses them to produce decompilation output. We train and evaluate our technique on snippets of binary machine code compiled from C source code. The general approach we outline in this paper is not language-specific and requires little or no domain knowledge of a language and its properties or how a compiler operates, making the approach easily extensible to new languages and constructs. Furthermore, the technique can be extended and applied in situations to which traditional decompilers are not targeted, such as for decompilation of isolated binary snippets; fast, on-demand decompilation; domain-specific learned decompilation; optimizing for readability of decompilation; and recovering control flow constructs, comments, and variable or function names. We show that the translations produced by this technique are often accurate or close and can provide a useful picture of the snippet's behavior.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to binary decompilation, yet they still treat code as plain text and ignore the graphs that govern program control flow. This limitation often yields syntactically fragile and logically inconsistent output, especially for optimized binaries. This paper presents \textsc\{HELIOS\}, a framework that reframes LLM-based decompilation as a structured reasoning task. \textsc\{HELIOS\} summarizes a binary's control flow and function calls into a hierarchical text representation that spells out basic blocks, their successors, and high-level patterns such as loops and conditionals. This representation is supplied to a general-purpose LLM, along with raw decompiler output, optionally combined with a compiler-in-the-loop that returns error messages when the generated code fails to build. On HumanEval-Decompile for \texttt\{x86\_64\}, \textsc\{HELIOS\} raises average object file compilability from 45.0\% to 85.2\% for Gemini~2.0 and from 71.4\% to 89.6\% for GPT-4.1~Mini. With compiler feedback, compilability exceeds 94\% and functional correctness improves by up to 5.6 percentage points over text-only prompting. Across six architectures drawn from x86, ARM, and MIPS, \textsc\{HELIOS\} reduces the spread in functional correctness while keeping syntactic correctness consistently high, all without fine-tuning. These properties make \textsc\{HELIOS\} a practical building block for reverse engineering workflows in security settings where analysts need recompilable, semantically faithful code across diverse hardware targets. },

  abstract = {Decompilation is widely used in reverse engineering to recover high-level language code from binary executables. While recent approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files. This limitation significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics from assembly code. To address this limitation, we propose \\saltm, a novel binary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared between binary and source code. The core idea of \\saltm is to abstract selected binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery. Given a binary function, \\saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree (\\salt) from assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language. It then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed \\salt to generate decompiled code. Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol recovery to improve readability and correctness. We compare \\saltm to three categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercial decompilers, and decompilation methods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP, Exebench). Our experimental results demonstrate that \\saltm is highly effective in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\\\% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with a 10.6\\\% improvement). The results further validate its robustness against four commonly used obfuscation techniques. Additionally, analyses of real-world software and a user study confirm that our decompiled output offers superior assistance to human analysts in comprehending binary functions.},

While modern decompilers can reconstruct and recover much information that is discarded during compilation, inferring variable names is still extremely difficult. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing, we propose a novel solution to infer variable names in decompiled code based on Masked Language Modeling, Byte-Pair Encoding, and neural architectures such as Transformers and BERT. Our solution takes \textit\{raw\} decompiler output, the less semantically meaningful code, as input, and enriches it using our proposed \textit\{finetuning\} technique, Constrained Masked Language Modeling. Using Constrained Masked Language Modeling introduces the challenge of predicting the number of masked tokens for the original variable name. We address this \textit\{count of token prediction\} challenge with our post-processing algorithm. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our trained VarBERT model is simpler and of much better performance. We evaluated our model on an existing large-scale data set with 164,632 binaries and showed that it can predict variable names identical to the ones present in the original source code up to 84.15\% of the time. },

It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks. },

This opacity necessitates the automated semantic analysis of on-chain smart contract bytecode, a fundamental research challenge with direct implications for identifying vulnerabilities and understanding malicious behavior. Prevailing decompilers struggle to reverse bytecode in a readable manner, often yielding convoluted code that critically hampers vulnerability analysis and thwarts efforts to dissect contract functionalities for security auditing. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a pioneering decompilation pipeline that, for the first time, successfully leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into human-readable and semantically faithful Solidity code. Our novel methodology first employs rigorous static program analysis to convert bytecode into a structured three-address code (TAC) representation. This intermediate representation then guides a Llama-3.2-3B model, specifically fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset of 238,446 TAC-to-Solidity function pairs, to generate high-quality Solidity. This approach uniquely recovers meaningful variable names, intricate control flow, and precise function signatures.

(2) Fine-grained Alignment Enhancement (FAE), which meticulously aligns assembly code with source code at the statement level by leveraging debugging information, is employed during the fine-tuning phase to achieve further improvements in decompilation.

  abstract = {Reverse engineering of binary executables is a critical problem in the computer security domain. On the one hand, malicious parties may recover interpretable source codes from the software products to gain commercial advantages. On the other hand, binary decompilation can be leveraged for code vulnerability analysis and malware detection. However, efficient binary decompilation is challenging. Conventional decompilers have the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To address the above problems, we propose Coda, the first end-to-end neural-based framework for code decompilation. Coda decomposes the decompilation task into two key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a tree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention feeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches. We assess Coda's performance with extensive experiments on various benchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82\% program recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-art decompilers yield 0\% accuracy.

  abstract = {The problem of reversing the compilation process, decompilation, is an important tool in reverse engineering of computer software. Recently, researchers have proposed using techniques from neural machine translation to automate the process in decompilation. Although such techniques hold the promise of targeting a wider range of source and assembly languages, to date they have primarily targeted C code. In this paper we argue that existing neural decompilers have achieved higher accuracy at the cost of requiring language-specific domain knowledge such as tokenizers and parsers to build an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the source language, which increases the overhead of supporting new languages. We explore a different tradeoff that, to the extent possible, treats the assembly and source languages as plain text, and show that this allows us to build a decompiler that is easily retargetable to new languages. We evaluate our prototype decompiler, Beyond The C (BTC), on Go, Fortran, OCaml, and C, and examine the impact of parameters such as tokenization and training data selection on the quality of decompilation, finding that it achieves comparable decompilation results to prior work in neural decompilation with significantly less domain knowledge. We will release our training data, trained decompilation models, and code to help encourage future research into language-agnostic decompilation. },

  abstract = {Binary code analysis is the foundation of crucial tasks in the security domain; thus building effective binary analysis techniques is more important than ever. Large language models (LLMs) although have brought impressive improvement to source code tasks, do not directly generalize to assembly code due to the unique challenges of assembly: (1) the low information density of assembly and (2) the diverse optimizations in assembly code. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code. Nova outperforms existing techniques on binary code decompilation by up to 14.84 -- 21.58% (absolute percentage point improvement) higher Pass@1 and Pass@10, and outperforms the latest binary code similarity detection techniques by up to 6.17% Recall@1, showing promising abilities on both assembly generation and understanding tasks. },

The problem of decompilation is extremely important for security researchers. Finding vulnerabilities and understanding how malware operates is much easier when done over source code. The importance of decompilation has motivated the construction of hand-crafted rule-based decompilers. Such decompilers have been designed by experts to detect specific control-flow structures and idioms in low-level code and lift them to source level. The cost of supporting additional languages or new language features in these models is very high. We present a novel approach to decompilation based on neural machine translation. The main idea is to automatically learn a decompiler from a given compiler. Given a compiler from a source language S to a target language T , our approach automatically trains a decompiler that can translate (decompile) T back to S . We used our framework to decompile both LLVM IR and x86 assembly to C code with high success rates. Using our LLVM and x86 instantiations, we were able to successfully decompile over 97% and 88% of our benchmarks respectively. },

However, most of the traditional Java reverse engineering tools are strictly rule defined, thus are not fault-tolerant, which pose serious problem when noise and interference were introduced into the system. In this paper, we view reverse engineering as a statistical machine translation task instead of rule-based task, and propose a fault-tolerant Java decompiler based on machine translation models. Our model is based on attention-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Transformer architectures. First, we measure the translation quality on both the redundant and purified datasets. Next, we evaluate the fault-tolerance(anti-noise ability) of our framework on test sets with different unit error probability (UEP). In addition, we compare the suitability of different word segmentation algorithms for decompilation task. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is more robust and fault-tolerant compared to traditional Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) based decompilers. Specifically, in terms of BLEU-4 and Word Error Rate (WER), our performance has reached 94.50% and 2.65% on the redundant test set; 92.30% and 3.48% on the purified test set. },

  abstract = {Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security, as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf\{19,448\} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \textbf\{19\} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation. },

  abstract = {Decompilation transforms low-level program languages (PL) (e.g., binary code) into high-level PLs (e.g., C/C++). It has been widely used when analysts perform security analysis on software (systems) whose source code is unavailable, such as vulnerability search and malware analysis. However, current decompilation tools usually need lots of experts' efforts, even for years, to generate the rules for decompilation, which also requires long-term maintenance as the syntax of high-level PL or low-level PL changes. Also, an ideal decompiler should concisely generate high-level PL with similar functionality to the source low-level PL and semantic information (e.g., meaningful variable names), just like human-written code. Unfortunately, existing manually-defined rule-based decompilation techniques only functionally restore the low-level PL to a similar high-level PL and are still powerless to recover semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel neural decompilation approach to translate low-level PL into accurate and user-friendly high-level PL, effectively improving its readability and understandability. Furthermore, we implement the proposed approaches called SEAM. Evaluations on four real-world applications show that SEAM has an average accuracy of 94.41%, which is much better than prior neural machine translation (NMT) models. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of semantic information recovery through a questionnaire survey, and the average accuracy is 92.64%, which is comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art compilers. },

This approach allows DL computations to be undertaken at low cost across a variety of computing platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and various hardware accelerators. We present BTD (Bin to DNN), a decompiler for deep neural network (DNN) executables. BTD takes DNN executables and outputs full model specifications, including types of DNN operators, network topology, dimensions, and parameters that are (nearly) identical to those of the input models. BTD delivers a practical framework to process DNN executables compiled by different DL compilers and with full optimizations enabled on x86 platforms. It employs learning-based techniques to infer DNN operators, dynamic analysis to reveal network architectures, and symbolic execution to facilitate inferring dimensions and parameters of DNN operators. Our evaluation reveals that BTD enables accurate recovery of full specifications of complex DNNs with millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet). The recovered DNN specifications can be re-compiled into a new DNN executable exhibiting identical behavior to the input executable. We show that BTD can boost two representative attacks, adversarial example generation and knowledge stealing, against DNN executables. We also demonstrate cross-architecture legacy code reuse using BTD, and envision BTD being used for other critical downstream tasks like DNN security hardening and patching. },

Recently, end-to-end decompilation methods powered by large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to generate highly readable source code with minimal human intervention. However, existing LLM-based approaches face several critical challenges, including limited capability in reconstructing code structure and logic, low accuracy in data recovery, concerns over data security and privacy, and high computational resource requirements. To address these issues, we develop the CodeInverter Suite, making three contributions: (1) the CodeInverter Workflow (CIW) is a novel prompt engineering workflow that incorporates control flow graphs (CFG) and explicit data mappings to improve LLM-based decompilation. (2) Using CIW on well-known source code datasets, we curate the CodeInverter Dataset (CID), a domain-specific dataset containing 8.69 million samples that contains CFGs and data mapping tables. (3) We train the CoderInverter Models (CIMs) on CID, generating two lightweight LLMs (with 1.3B and 6.7B parameters) intended for efficient inference in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the CIW substantially enhances the performance of various LLMs across multiple metrics. Our CIM-6.7B can achieve state-of-the-art decompilation performance, outperforming existing LLMs even with over 100x more parameters in decompilation tasks, an average improvement of 11.03% in re-executability, 6.27% in edit similarity. },

In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact. },

However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLM decompilation technology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Decompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmark Decompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues.

  abstract = {A C decompiler converts an executable into source code. The recovered C source code, once re-compiled, is expected to produce an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. With over twenty years of development, C decompilers have been widely used in production to support reverse engineering applications. Despite the prosperous development of C decompilers, it is widely acknowledged that decompiler outputs are mainly used for human consumption, and are not suitable for automatic recompilation. Often, a substantial amount of manual effort is required to fix the decompiler outputs before they can be recompiled and executed properly. This paper is motived by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in comprehending dense corpus of natural language. To alleviate the tedious, costly and often error-prone manual effort in fixing decompiler outputs, we investigate the feasibility of using LLMs to augment decompiler outputs, thus delivering recompilable decompilation. Note that different from previous efforts that focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with higher readability (e.g., recovering type/variable names), we focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with recompilability, meaning to generate code that can be recompiled into an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. We conduct a pilot study to characterize the obstacles in recompiling the outputs of the de facto commercial C decompiler -- IDA-Pro. We then propose a two-step, hybrid approach to augmenting decompiler outputs with LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a set of popular C test cases, and show that our approach can deliver a high recompilation success rate to over 75% with moderate effort, whereas none of the IDA-Pro's original outputs can be recompiled. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations of our approach and promising future research directions. },

security fields such as software vulnerability discovery and analysis,

decompilers mainly rely on experts to write rules, which leads to
bottlenecks such as low scalability, development difficulties, and long

problems mentioned above hinder the efficiency of advanced applications

attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) mechanism, which
converts low-level PL into high-level PL while acquiring legibility and
keeping functionally similar. To compensate for the information
asymmetry between the low-level and high-level PL, a translation method
based on basic operations of low-level PL is designed. This method
improves the generalization of the NMT model and captures the
translation rules between PLs more accurately and efficiently. Besides,
we implement a neural decompilation framework called Neutron. The
evaluation of two practical applications shows that Neutron's average
program accuracy is 96.96\%, which is better than the traditional NMT

  abstract = {The decompiler is one of the most common tools for examining executable
binaries without the corresponding source code. It transforms binaries
into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Unfortunately,
decompiler output is far from readable because the decompilation process
is often incomplete. State-of-the-art techniques use machine learning to
predict missing information like variable names. While these approaches
are often able to suggest good variable names in context, no existing
work examines how the selection of training data influences these
machine learning models. We investigate how data provenance and the
quality of training data affect performance, and how well, if at all,
trained models generalize across software domains. We focus on the
variable renaming problem using one such machine learning model, DIRE.
We first describe DIRE in detail and the accompanying technique used to
generate training data from raw code. We also evaluate DIRE's overall
performance without respect to data quality. Next, we show how training
on more popular, possibly higher quality code (measured using GitHub
stars) leads to a more generalizable model because popular code tends to
have more diverse variable names. Finally, we evaluate how well DIRE
predicts domain-specific identifiers, propose a modification to
incorporate domain information, and show that it can predict identifiers
in domain-specific scenarios 23\% more frequently than the original DIRE
model.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a widely utilized technique in reverse engineering,
aimed at restoring binary code to human-readable high-level language
code. However, the readability of the output from traditional
decompilers is often poor. With advancements in language models, several
learning-based decompilation methods have emerged. Nevertheless, the
probabilistic nature of language models leads to outputs whose
correctness cannot be guaranteed, necessitating further analysis by
engineers to identify the corresponding functionality of the code.
Inspired by compiler toolchains, we propose a novel approach to enhance
the effectiveness of language models in decompilation tasks. Traditional
rule-based methods and learning-based techniques are fused together in
our approach, drawing insights from both paradigms. Specifically, we
present a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model called IRaDT tailored
to refine decompilation outputs at the intermediate representation
level. Through this hybridization, we aim to address the limitations of
existing methodologies and achieve more accurate and robust
decompilation. We construct a diverse decompilation dataset targeting IR
and evaluated IRaDT based on this dataset. The experimental results
indicate that IRaDT has the ability to improve the readability of IR
while ensuring its compileability, achieving a 74\% improvement compared
to RetDec and a 93\% improvement compared to ChatGPT.},

  abstract = {Legacy software, particularly from the 1990s, often becomes obsolete due
to aging hardware and outdated software environments. Traditionally,
software modernization required extensive manual effort, involving
reverse engineering, code rewriting, and re-architecting. However,
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new
possibilities for automating software translation and modernization.
This paper explores the feasibility of using LLMs for modernizing
90s-era Windows applications, specifically migrating legacy C and C++
code to Python. Our methodology includes decompilation, source code
analysis, automated translation using ChatGPT, and user interface
reconstruction. We empirically evaluate three software projects by
analyzing LLM-based translation accuracy across different code
structures, including algorithmic logic, file handling, and graphical
interfaces. Results indicate that while LLMs achieve high translation
accuracy (-88\%) for structured code, challenges persist in handling
decompiled code and user interface generation. The study provides
insights into the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in real-world
software renovation, offering guidelines for leveraging machine learning
in legacy system modernization. These findings contribute to both
academic research and practical applications, suggesting a pathway for

  abstract = {The goal of decompilation is to convert compiled low-level code (e.g.,
assembly code) back into high-level programming languages, enabling
analysis in scenarios where source code is unavailable. This task
supports various reverse engineering applications, such as vulnerability
identification, malware analysis, and legacy software migration. The
end-to-end decompilation method based on large language models (LLMs)
reduces reliance on additional tools and minimizes manual intervention
due to its inherent properties. However, previous end-to-end methods
often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control
flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it
challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these
issues, we propose the ReF Decompile method, which incorporates the
following innovations: (1) The Relabeling strategy replaces jump target
addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function
Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable
information from binary files. Experimental results on the
Humaneval-Decompile Benchmark demonstrate that ReF Decompile surpasses
comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of
61.43\%.},

  abstract = {Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively
employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program
comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity
smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in
reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck
of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate function identification,
incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These
deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program
logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new
framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis
(SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the
complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow
analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically,
SmartHalo constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to
extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to
create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM
outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification.
Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart
contract functions shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the
quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g.,
Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o mini with SmartHalo further
enhances its performance, achieving a precision of 91.32\% and a recall
of 87.38\% for function boundaries, a precision of 90.40\% and a recall
of 88.82\% for variable types, and a precision of 80.66\% and a recall
of 91.78\% for contract attributes.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of binary vulnerabilities in the software supply chain
has become a critical security challenge. Existing vulnerability
detection approaches-including dynamic analysis, static analysis, and
decompilation-assisted analysis-all suffer from limitations such as
insufficient coverage, high false-positive and false-negative rates, or
poor compatibility. Although decompilation technology can serve as a
bridge connecting binary-code and source-code vulnerability detection
tools, current schemes suffer from inadequate semantic restoration
quality and lack of tool compatibility. To address these issues, this
paper proposes LLMVulDecompiler, a binary decompilation model based on
fine-tuned large language models designed to generate high-precision
decompiled code that integrates directly with source-code static
analysis tools. We construct a dedicated training and evaluation dataset
that covers multiple compiler optimization levels (e.g., O0-O3) and a
diverse set of program functionalities. We adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
strategy that involves first building foundational decompilation
capabilities, then enhancing vulnerability-specific features.
Additionally, we design a low-cost inference pipeline and establish
multi-dimensional evaluation criteria, including restoration similarity,
compilation success rate, and functional correctness. Experimental
results show that the model significantly outperforms baseline models in
terms of average edit distance, compilation success rate, and black-box
test pass rate on the HumanEval-C benchmark. In tests on 12 real-world
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) instances, the approach
achieved a detection accuracy of 91.7\%, with substantially reduced
false-positive and false-negative rates. This study demonstrates the
effectiveness of specialized fine-tuning of large language models for
binary decompilation and vulnerability detection, offering a new pathway
for binary security analysis.},

  abstract = {Decompiling Rust binaries is challenging due to the language's rich type system, aggressive compiler optimizations, and widespread use of high-level abstractions. In this work, we conduct a benchmark-driven evaluation of decompilation quality across core Rust features and compiler build modes. Our automated scoring framework shows that generic types, trait methods, and error handling constructs significantly reduce decompilation quality, especially in release builds. Through representative case studies, we analyze how specific language constructs affect control flow, variable naming, and type information recovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for tool developers and highlight the need for Rust-aware decompilation strategies. },

@article{Zou2025,
  abstract = {As one of the key tools in many security tasks, decompilers reconstruct human-readable source code from binaries. Yet, despite recent advances, their outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and remain difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanced decompiler-LLM pipeline with a fine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: preserving accuracy while improving readability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality assessment system to score the decompiled source code from multiple aspects, and use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best output during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the quality of 68.2% of all the functions produced by the native decompiler. },
