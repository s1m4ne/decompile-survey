  abstract = {Modern industry is built, among other things, on software, the presence of vulnerabilities in which is a significant problem. It is more rational to search for vulnerabilities in those representations of the program (source code, algorithms, architecture, etc.) on the basis of which they were developed. However, as a rule, there is difficult-to-analyze machine code available. Obtaining higher-level representations is possible by reverse engineering, carried out in various ways, such as expert, algorithmic, intelligent, enumeration and logging. The qualitative comparison of these representations is given. The current study is devoted to a new method of reverse engineering based on the use of genetic algorithms. The course of the research and the following main scientific results are briefly described: the methodology of reverse engineering of a software system, the model of the life cycle of a program with multi-level vulnerabilities, the concept of genetic de-evolution of program representations, scientific, methodological and algorithmic instrumentation for genetic decompilation, an architectural block for conducting genetic de-evolution of representations with functionality for searching for multi-level vulnerabilities. All results are novel, as well as theoretically and practically significant.},

  abstract = {Analysis of binary code is a building block of computer security. Especially in malware or firmware analysis where source code oftentimes is not available, techniques like decompilation are utilized to Figure out the functionality of binaries. During the optimization phase in modern compilers, human-readable expressions are often transformed into instruction sequences (compiler idioms or idioms) that may be more efficient in terms of speed or size than the direct translation. However, these transformations are often considerably worse in terms of readability for the analyst. Such compiler specific sequences are not only significantly longer than the apparent translation of the original high-level language operation but also have no trivial correlation to the original expression’s semantics. Modern decompilers address this issue by reverting idioms using static, manually crafted rules. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to find and annotate arithmetic idioms with their corresponding high-level language expressions to significantly simplify manual analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require manual work to create the patterns for matching idioms and significantly less manual labour to derive the transformation rules to calculate the original constants. In our evaluation, we compared the results of PIdARCI against the current academic and commercial state-of-the-art Ghidra, RetDec, and Hex Rays / IDA Pro. We show that PIdARCI matches more than 99% of all considered idioms, exceeding the matching rate of the other approaches.},

  abstract = {Vulnerabilities are challenging to locate and repair, especially when
source code is unavailable and binary patching is required. Manual
methods are time-consuming, require significant expertise, and do not
scale to the rate at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. Automated
methods are an attractive alternative, and we propose Partially
Recompilable Decompilation (PRD) to help automate the process. PRD lifts
suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or
review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level
techniques. Although decompilation and recompilation do not typically
succeed on an entire binary, our approach does because it is limited to
a few functions, such as those identified by our binary fault
localization. We evaluate the assumptions underlying our approach and
find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, up to 79\%
of individual functions are successfully decompiled and recompiled. In
comparison, only 1.7\% of the full C-binaries succeed. When
recompilation succeeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 93.0\% of
the time. We evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process
incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; and
human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand
Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating
only on binaries, perform as well as, and sometimes better than
full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a
success rate consistent with the same tools operating with access to the
entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning
CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those
produced by top CGC teams. For generality, the evaluation includes two
independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world
binaries.},
