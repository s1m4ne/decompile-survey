  abstract = {The rise of smart contracts---autonomous applications running on blockchains---has led to a growing number of threats, necessitating sophisticated program analysis. However, smart contracts, which transact valuable tokens and cryptocurrencies, are compiled to very low-level bytecode. This bytecode is the ultimate semantics and means of enforcement of the contract.We present the Gigahorse toolchain. At its core is a reverse compiler (i.e., a decompiler) that decompiles smart contracts from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into a high-level 3-address code representation. The new intermediate representation of smart contracts makes implicit data- and control-flow dependencies of the EVM bytecode explicit. Decompilation obviates the need for a contract's source and allows the analysis of both new and deployed contracts.Gigahorse advances the state of the art on several fronts. It gives the highest analysis precision and completeness among decompilers for Ethereum smart contracts---e.g., Gigahorse can decompile over 99.98% of deployed contracts, compared to 88% for the recently-published Vandal decompiler and under 50% for the state-of-the-practice Porosity decompiler. Importantly, Gigahorse offers a full-featured toolchain for further analyses (and a "batteries included" approach, with multiple clients already implemented), together with the highest performance and scalability. Key to these improvements is Gigahorse's use of a declarative, logic-based specification, which allows high-level insights to inform low-level decompilation.},

  abstract = {Binary-level pointer analysis can be of use in symbolic execution, testing, verification, and decompilation of software binaries. In various such contexts, it is crucial that the result is trustworthy, i.e., it can be formally established that the pointer designations are overapproximative. This paper presents an approach to formally proven correct binary-level pointer analysis. A salient property of our approach is that it first generically considers what proof obligations a generic abstract domain for pointer analysis must satisfy. This allows easy instantiation of different domains, varying in precision, while preserving the correctness of the analysis. In the tradeoff between scalability and precision, such customization allows "meaningful" precision (sufficiently precise to ensure basic sanity properties, such as that relevant parts of the stack frame are not overwritten during function execution) while also allowing coarse analysis when pointer computations have become too obfuscated during compilation for sound and accurate bounds analysis. We experiment with three different abstract domains with high, medium, and low precision. Evaluation shows that our approach is able to derive designations for memory writes soundly in COTS binaries, in a context-sensitive interprocedural fashion.},

  abstract = {According to Comscore1, Android users in the U.S spend an average of 2.8 hours per day using mobile media. On the other hand, according to Statista reports2, Android users were able to choose between 2.2 million applications on June 2016. Among these applications, there are ones reported by Google Android Security Service3 as malware, virus, or illegal theft. Many tools such as Dex2Jar4, apktool5, and jd-gui6 analyze and reverse engineer Android applications and can be used to illegally copy or transform the applications as well. In order to protect applications from piracy or illegal theft, it is necessary to detect theft by measuring application similarity. In the literature, previous studies on theft detection have measured application similarity at two levels, source or executable code level, which have some limitations. Source codes are not available if the codes are legacy one or are developed by upstream suppliers. In the case of the executable codes, application similarity is measured 1) using the source codes decompiled from the executables, or 2) using the characteristics extracted from the executables (i.e., birthmark). For example, DroidMoss [5] applied a fuzzy hashing technique to effectively localize and detect the changes from app-repackaging behavior. Reference [4] proposed software birthmarks to show the unique characteristics of a program and detected software theft based on the birthmarks.},

  abstract = {The analysis of programs is an important and well researched topic in information security, specifically for finding bugs in binary programs or analyzing malicious software. Many commonly used techniques rely on dynamic analysis by running samples and monitoring their behavior or are based on the cumbersome and time consuming inspection of plain assembly code.In this paper we present a novel approach for static analysis we are using in bin2llvm, a work-in-progress analysis framework, in order to find and identify cryptographic routines in binary programs. Our approach does not need to run the target of analysis in any way and is based on decompilation of binaries to an intermediate language similar to assembly code, the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), by using the open source decompiler Dagger. After decompilation we are able to apply various analysis techniques to the resulting code. These methods can be easily implemented and extended as optimization passes for the LLVM optimizer and can therefore benefit from its extensive API. Although we discovered certain drawbacks and issues with this approach, our results and proof of concept show that IR code is a very suitable target for analyses and it is well worth driving research further into this topic.},

  abstract = {We present a new type of attack termed denial of engineering operations in which an attacker can interfere with the normal cycle of an engineering operation leading to a loss of situational awareness. Specifically, the attacker can deceive the engineering software during attempts to retrieve the ladder logic program from a programmable logic controller (PLC) by manipulating the ladder logic on the PLC, such that the software is unable to process it while the PLC continues to execute it successfully. This attack vector can provide sufficient cover for the attacker»s actual scenario to play out while the owner tries to understand the problem and reestablish positive operational control. To enable the forensic analysis and, eventually, eliminate the threat, we have developed the first decompiler for ladder logic programs.Ladder logic is a graphical programming language for PLCs that control physical processes such as power grid, pipelines, and chemical plants; PLCs are a common target of malicious modifications leading to the compromise of the control behavior (and potentially serious consequences). Our decompiler, Laddis, transforms a low-level representation to its corresponding high-level original representation comprising of graphical symbols and connections. The evaluation of the accuracy of the decompiler on the program of varying complexity demonstrates perfect reconstruction of the original program. We present three new attack scenarios on PLC-deployed ladder logic and demonstrate the effectiveness of the decompiler on these scenarios.},

  abstract = {Fitbit fitness trackers record sensitive personal information, including daily step counts, heart rate profiles, and locations visited. By design, these devices gather and upload activity data to a cloud service, which provides aggregate statistics to mobile app users. The same principles govern numerous other Internet-of-Things (IoT) services that target different applications. As a market leader, Fitbit has developed perhaps the most secure wearables architecture that guards communication with end-to-end encryption. In this article, we analyze the complete Fitbit ecosystem and, despite the brand's continuous efforts to harden its products, we demonstrate a series of vulnerabilities with potentially severe implications to user privacy and device security. We employ a range of techniques, such as protocol analysis, software decompiling, and both static and dynamic embedded code analysis, to reverse engineer previously undocumented communication semantics, the official smartphone app, and the tracker firmware. Through this interplay and in-depth analysis, we reveal how attackers can exploit the Fitbit protocol to extract private information from victims without leaving a trace, and wirelessly flash malware without user consent. We demonstrate that users can tamper with both the app and firmware to selfishly manipulate records or circumvent Fitbit's walled garden business model, making the case for an independent, user-controlled, and more secure ecosystem. Finally, based on the insights gained, we make specific design recommendations that can not only mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, but are also broadly applicable to securing future wearable system architectures.},

A wrong application of cryptography or security-critical APIs, however, exposes secrets to unrelated parties and undermines the overall security.We introduce an approach for uncovering cryptographic misuse in iOS applications. We present a way to decompile 64-bit ARM binaries to their LLVM intermediate representation (IR). Based on the reverse-engineered code, static program slicing is applied to determine the data flow in relevant code segments. For this analysis to be most accurate, we propose an adapted version of Andersen's pointer analysis, capable of handling decompiled LLVM IR code with type information recovered from the binary. To finally highlight the improper usage of cryptographic APIs, a set of predefined security rules is checked against the extracted execution paths. As a result, we are not only able to confirm the existence of problematic statements in iOS applications but can also pinpoint their origin.To evaluate the applicability of our solution and to disclose possible weaknesses, we conducted a manual and automated inspection on a set of iOS applications that include cryptographic functionality. We found that 343 out of 417 applications (82%) are subject to at least one security misconception. Among the most common flaws are the usage of non-random initialization vectors and constant encryption keys as input to cryptographic primitives.},

  abstract = {Desktop-manufacturing techniques like 3D printing are increasingly popular because they reduce the cost and complexity of producing customized objects on demand. Unfortunately, the vibrant communities of early adopters, often referred to as "makers," are not well-served by currently available software pipelines. Users today must compose idiosyncratic sequences of tools which are typically repurposed variants of proprietary software originally designed for expert specialists.  This paper proposes fundamental programming-languages techniques to bring improved rigor, reduced complexity, and new functionality to the computer-aided design (CAD) software pipeline for applications like 3D-printing. Compositionality, denotational semantics, compiler correctness, and program synthesis all play key roles in our approach, starting from the perspective that solid geometry is a programming language.  Specifically, we define a purely functional language for CAD called LambdaCAD and a polygon surface-mesh intermediate representation. We then define denotational semantics of both languages to 3D solids and a compiler from CAD to mesh accompanied by a proof of semantics preservation. We illustrate the utility of this foundation by developing a novel synthesis algorithm based on evaluation contexts to "reverse compile" difficult-to-edit meshes downloaded from online maker communities back to more-editable CAD programs. All our prototypes have been implemented in OCaml to enable further exploration of functional programming for desktop manufacturing.},

  abstract = {Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem for smart contracts: full-fledged inter-communicating programs that capture the transaction logic of an account. Unlike programs in mainstream languages, a gas limit restricts the execution of an Ethereum smart contract: execution proceeds as long as gas is available. Thus, gas is a valuable resource that can be manipulated by an attacker to provoke unwanted behavior in a victim's smart contract (e.g., wasting or blocking funds of said victim). Gas-focused vulnerabilities exploit undesired behavior when a contract (directly or through other interacting contracts) runs out of gas. Such vulnerabilities are among the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior may be uncommon in non-attack scenarios and reasoning about it is far from trivial.  In this paper, we classify and identify gas-focused vulnerabilities, and present MadMax: a static program analysis technique to automatically detect gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. Our approach combines a control-flow-analysis-based decompiler and declarative program-structure queries. The combined analysis captures high-level domain-specific concepts (such as "dynamic data structure storage" and "safely resumable loops") and achieves high precision and scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain in just 10 hours (with decompilation timeouts in 8% of the cases) and flags contracts with a (highly volatile) monetary value of over $2.8B as vulnerable. Manual inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that 81% of the sampled warnings do indeed lead to vulnerabilities, which we report on in our experiment.},

This paper proposes a novel approach to restructure the control flow graph recovered from binary programs in a semantics-preserving fashion. The algorithm is designed from the ground up with the goal of producing C code that is both goto-free and drastically reducing the mental load required for an analyst to understand it. As a result, the code generated with this technique is well-structured, idiomatic, readable, easy to understand and fully exploits the expressiveness of C language.

Thanks to the optimization guidelines prescribed by the C++ standard, commercial C++ binaries tend to be optimized. While state-of-the-art class inheritance inference solutions are effective in dealing with unoptimized code, their efficacy is impeded by optimization. Particularly, constructor inlining---or worse exclusion---due to optimization render class inheritance recovery challenging. Further, while modern solutions such as MARX can successfully group classes within an inheritance sub-tree, they fail to establish directionality of inheritance, which is crucial for security-related applications (e.g. decompilation). We implemented a prototype of DeClassifier using Binary Analysis Platform (BAP) and evaluated DeClassifier against 16 binaries compiled using gcc under multiple optimization settings. We show that (1) DeClassifier can recover 94.5% and 71.4% true positive directed edges in the class hierarchy tree (CHT) under O0 and O2 optimizations respectively, (2) a combination of constructor-destructor (ctor-dtor) analysis provides a substantial improvement in inheritance inference than constructor-only (ctor-only) analysis.},

  abstract = {Android is currently the most popular smartphone platform which occupied 88% of global sale by the end of 2nd quarter 2018. With the popularity of these applications, it is also inviting cybercriminals to develop malware application for accessing important information from smartphones. The major objective of cybercriminals to develop Malware apps or Malicious apps to threaten the organization privacy data, user privacy data, and device integrity. Early identification of such malware apps can help the android user to save private data and device integrity. In this study, features extracted from intermediate code representations obtained using decompilation of APK file are used for providing requisite input data to develop the models for predicting android malware applications. These models are trained using extreme learning with multiple kernel functions ans also compared with the model trained using most frequently used classifiers like linear regression, decision tree, polynomial regression, and logistic regression. This paper also focuses on the effectiveness of data sampling techniques for balancing data and feature selection methods for selecting right sets of significant uncorrelated metrics. The high-value of accuracy and AUC confirm the predicting capability of data sampling, sets of metrics, and training algorithms to malware and normal applications.},

  abstract = {Mobile phones have become nowadays a commodity to the majority of people. Using them, people are able to access the world of Internet and connect with their friends, their colleagues at work or even unknown people with common interests. This proliferation of the mobile devices has also been seen as an opportunity for the cyber criminals to deceive smartphone users and steel their money directly or indirectly, respectively, by accessing their bank accounts through the smartphones or by blackmailing them or selling their private data such as photos, credit card data, etc. to third parties. This is usually achieved by installing malware to smartphones masking their malevolent payload as a legitimate application and advertise it to the users with the hope that mobile users will install it in their devices. Thus, any existing application can easily be modified by integrating a malware and then presented it as a legitimate one. In response to this, scientists have proposed a number of malware detection and classification methods using a variety of techniques. Even though, several of them achieve relatively high precision in malware classification, there is still space for improvement. In this paper, we propose a text mining all repeated pattern detection method which uses the decompiled files of an application in order to classify a suspicious application into one of the known malware families. Based on the experimental results using a real malware dataset, the methodology tries to correctly classify (without any misclassification) all randomly selected malware applications of 3 categories with 3 different families each.},

  abstract = {Binary lifting and recompilation allow a wide range of install-time program transformations, such as security hardening, deobfuscation, and reoptimization. Existing binary lifting tools are based on static disassembly and thus have to rely on heuristics to disassemble binaries.In this paper, we present BinRec, a new approach to heuristic-free binary recompilation which lifts dynamic traces of a binary to a compiler-level intermediate representation (IR) and lowers the IR back to a "recovered" binary. This enables BinRec to apply rich program transformations, such as compiler-based optimization passes, on top of the recovered representation. We identify and address a number of challenges in binary lifting, including unique challenges posed by our dynamic approach. In contrast to existing frameworks, our dynamic frontend can accurately disassemble and lift binaries without heuristics, and we can successfully recover obfuscated code and all SPEC INT 2006 benchmarks including C++ applications. We evaluate BinRec in three application domains: i) binary reoptimization, ii) deobfuscation (by recovering partial program semantics from virtualization-obfuscated code), and iii) binary hardening (by applying existing compiler-level passes such as AddressSanitizer and SafeStack on binary code).},

Android apps are particularly exposed to malicious reverse engineering, because their code can be easily analyzed and decompiled, or monitored using debugging tools, that were originally meant to be used by developers.In this paper, we propose a solution to identify attempts of malicious reverse engineering on Android apps. Our approach is based on a series of periodic checks on the execution environment (i.e., Android components) and on the app itself. The check outcome is encoded into a Magic Number and send to a sever for validation. The owner of the app is then supposed to take countermeasures and react, by disconnecting or banning the apps under attack.Our empirical validation suggests that the execution overhead caused by our periodic checks is acceptable, because its resource consumption is compatible with the resources commonly available in smartphones.},

  abstract = {The complexities that arise from the implementation of object-oriented concepts in C++ such as virtual dispatch and dynamic type casting have attracted the attention of attackers and defenders alike. Binary-level defenses are dependent on full and precise recovery of class inheritance tree of a given program. While current solutions focus on recovering single and multiple inheritances from the binary, they are oblivious of virtual inheritance. The conventional wisdom among binary-level defenses is that virtual inheritance is uncommon and/or support for single and multiple inheritances provides implicit support for virtual inheritance. In this paper, we show neither to be true. Specifically, (1) we present an efficient technique to detect virtual inheritance in C++ binaries and show through a study that virtual inheritance can be found in non-negligible number (more than 10% on Linux and 12.5% on Windows) of real-world C++ programs including Mysql and Libstdc++. (2) We show that failure to handle virtual inheritance introduces both false positives and false negatives in the hierarchy tree. These falses either introduce attack surface when the hierarchy recovered is used to enforce CFI policies, or make the hierarchy difficult to understand when it is needed for program understanding (e.g., during decompilation). (3) We present a solution to recover virtual inheritance from COTS binaries. We recover a maximum of 95% and 95.5% (GCC -O0) and a minimum of 77.5% and 73.8% (Clang -O2) of virtual and intermediate bases respectively in the virtual inheritance tree.},

  abstract = {Malware analysis is key for cybersecurity overall improvement. Analysis tools have been evolving from complete static analyzers to decompilers. Malware decompilation allows for code inspection at higher abstraction levels, easing incident response. However, the decompilation procedure has many challenges, such as opaque constructions, irreversible mappings, semantic gap bridging, among others. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages the human analyst expertise to overcome decompilation challenges. We name this approach "DoD---debug-oriented decompilation", in which the analyst is able to reverse engineer the malware sample on his own and to instruct the decompiler to translate selected code portions (e.g., decision branches, fingerprinting functions, payloads etc.) into high level code. With DoD, the analyst might group all decompiled pieces into new code to be analyzed by other tool, or to develop a novel malware sample from previous pieces of code and thus exercise a Proof-of-Concept (PoC). To validate our approach, we propose RevEngE, the Reverse Engineering Engine for malware decompilation and reassembly, a set of GDB extensions that intercept and introspect into executed functions to build an Intermediate Representation (IR) in real-time, enabling any-time decompilation. We evaluate RevEngE with x86 ELF binaries collected from VirusShare, and show that a new malware sample created from the decompilation of independent functions of five known malware samples is considered "clean" by all VirusTotal's AVs.},

Without loops or functions, editing CSG can require many coordinated changes, and existing mesh decompilers use heuristics that can obfuscate high-level structure. This paper proposes a second decompilation stage to robustly "shrink" unstructured CSG expressions into more editable programs with map and fold operators. We present Szalinski, a tool that uses Equality Saturation with semantics-preserving CAD rewrites to efficiently search for smaller equivalent programs. Szalinski relies on inverse transformations, a novel way for solvers to speculatively add equivalences to an E-graph. We qualitatively evaluate Szalinski in case studies, show how it composes with an existing mesh decompiler, and demonstrate that Szalinski can shrink large models in seconds.},

  abstract = {A C decompiler converts an executable (the output from a C compiler) into source code. The recovered C source code, once recompiled, will produce an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. With over twenty years of development, C decompilers have been widely used in production to support reverse engineering applications, including legacy software migration, security retrofitting, software comprehension, and to act as the first step in launching adversarial software exploitations. As the paramount component and the trust base in numerous cybersecurity tasks, C decompilers have enabled the analysis of malware, ransomware, and promoted cybersecurity professionals’ understanding of vulnerabilities in real-world systems.  In contrast to this flourishing market, our observation is that in academia, outputs of C decompilers (i.e., recovered C source code) are still not extensively used. Instead, the intermediate representations are often more desired for usage when developing applications such as binary security retrofitting. We acknowledge that such conservative approaches in academia are a result of widespread and pessimistic views on the decompilation correctness. However, in conventional software engineering and security research, how much of a problem is, for instance, reusing a piece of simple legacy code by taking the output of modern C decompilers?  In this work, we test decompilation correctness to present an up-to-date understanding regarding modern C decompilers. We detected a total of 1,423 inputs that can trigger decompilation errors from four popular decompilers, and with extensive manual effort, we identified 13 bugs in two open-source decompilers. Our findings show that the overly pessimistic view of decompilation correctness leads researchers to underestimate the potential of modern decompilers; the state-of-the-art decompilers certainly care about the functional correctness, and they are making promising progress. However, some tasks that have been studied for years in academia, such as type inference and optimization, still impede C decompilers from generating quality outputs more than is reflected in the literature. These issues rarely receive enough attention and can lead to great confusion that misleads users.},

IGScript makes the presentation animations editable, e.g., it allows to cut, copy, paste, append, or even delete some animation clips.

The proposed mechanism is highly scalable with well-coordinated infrastructure and self-optimizing capabilities to proficiently tackle fast-growing dynamic variants of sophisticated malware threats and attacks with 99.01% detection accuracy. For a comprehensive evaluation, the authors employed current state-of-the-art malware datasets (Android Malware Dataset, Androzoo) with standard performance evaluation metrics. Moreover, MulDroid is compared with our constructed contemporary hybrid DL-driven architectures and benchmark algorithms. Our proposed mechanism outperforms in terms of detection accuracy with a trivial tradeoff speed efficiency.

PEPM has a history dating back to 1991, and originates in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over the years, the scope of PEPM has expanded to include a variety of research areas centered around the theme of semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analysed, and transformed whilst establishing or maintaining important semantic properties. Relevant topics range from refactoring, partial evaluation, supercompilation, staged programming, fusion, and other meta-programming to model-driven development, program analysis, inductive programming, decompilation, program generation, and abstract interpretation.},

  abstract = {WebAssembly has emerged as a low-level language for the web and beyond. Despite its popularity in different domains, little is known about WebAssembly binaries that occur in the wild. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of 8,461 unique WebAssembly binaries gathered from a wide range of sources, including source code repositories, package managers, and live websites. We study the security properties, source languages, and use cases of the binaries and how they influence the security of the WebAssembly ecosystem. Our findings update some previously held assumptions about real-world WebAssembly and highlight problems that call for future research. For example, we show that vulnerabilities that propagate from insecure source languages potentially affect a wide range of binaries (e.g., two thirds of the binaries are compiled from memory unsafe languages, such as C and C++) and that 21% of all binaries import potentially dangerous APIs from their host environment. We also show that cryptomining, which once accounted for the majority of all WebAssembly code, has been marginalized (less than 1% of all binaries found on the web) and gives way to a diverse set of use cases. Finally, 29% of all binaries on the web are minified, calling for techniques to decompile and reverse engineer WebAssembly. Overall, our results show that WebAssembly has left its infancy and is growing up into a language that powers a diverse ecosystem, with new challenges and opportunities for security researchers and practitioners. Besides these insights, we also share the dataset underlying our study, which is 58 times larger than the largest previously reported benchmark.},

Our approach combines a configurable proof term transformation with a decompiler from proof terms to suggested tactic scripts. The proof term transformation implements transport across equivalences in a way that removes references to the old version of the changed type and does not rely on axioms beyond those Coq assumes. We have implemented this approach in Pumpkin Pi, an extension to the Pumpkin Patch Coq plugin suite for proof repair. We demonstrate Pumpkin Pi’s flexibility on eight case studies, including supporting a benchmark from a user study,easing development with dependent types, porting functions and proofs between unary and binary numbers, and supporting an industrial proof engineer to interoperate between Coq and other verification tools more easily.},

  abstract = {Reducing a failure-inducing input to a smaller one is challenging for input with internal dependencies because most sub-inputs are invalid. Kalhauge and Palsberg made progress on this problem by mapping the task to a reduction problem for dependency graphs that avoids invalid inputs entirely. Their tool J-Reduce efficiently reduces Java bytecode to 24 percent of its original size, which made it the most effective tool until now. However, the output from their tool is often too large to be helpful in a bug report. In this paper, we show that more fine-grained modeling of dependencies leads to much more reduction. Specifically, we use propositional logic for specifying dependencies and we show how this works for Java bytecode. Once we have a propositional formula that specifies all valid sub-inputs, we run an algorithm that finds a small, valid, failure-inducing input. Our algorithm interleaves runs of the buggy program and calls to a procedure that finds a minimal satisfying assignment. Our experiments show that we can reduce Java bytecode to 4.6 percent of its original size, which is 5.3 times better than the 24.3 percent achieved by J-Reduce. The much smaller output is more suitable for bug reports.},

  abstract = {Successful software authorship de-anonymization has both software forensics applications and privacy implications. However, the process requires an efficient extraction of authorship attributes. The extraction of such attributes is very challenging, due to various software code formats from executable binaries with different toolchain provenance to source code with different programming languages. Moreover, the quality of attributes is bounded by the availability of software samples to a certain number of samples per author and a specific size for software samples. To this end, this work proposes a deep Learning-based approach for software authorship attribution, that facilitates large-scale, format-independent, language-oblivious, and obfuscation-resilient software authorship identification. This proposed approach incorporates the process of learning deep authorship attribution using a recurrent neural network, and ensemble random forest classifier for scalability to de-anonymize programmers. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach over the entire Google Code Jam (GCJ) dataset across all years (from 2008 to 2016) and over real-world code samples from 1,987 public repositories on GitHub. The results of our work show high accuracy despite requiring a smaller number of samples per author. Experimenting with source-code, our approach allows us to identify 8,903 GCJ authors, the largest-scale dataset used by far, with an accuracy of 92.3%. Using the real-world dataset, we achieved an identification accuracy of 94.38% for 745 C programmers on GitHub. Moreover, the proposed approach is resilient to language-specifics, and thus it can identify authors of four programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Python), and authors writing in mixed languages (e.g., Java/C++, Python/C++). Finally, our system is resistant to sophisticated obfuscation (e.g., using C Tigress) with an accuracy of 93.42% for a set of 120 authors. Experimenting with executable binaries, our approach achieves 95.74% for identifying 1,500 programmers of software binaries. Similar results were obtained when software binaries are generated with different compilation options, optimization levels, and removing of symbol information. Moreover, our approach achieves 93.86% for identifying 1,500 programmers of obfuscated binaries using all features adopted in Obfuscator-LLVM tool.},

In the case of repackaged malware, benign apps are injected with a malicious payload. Repackaged malware pose a serious threat to the Android ecosystem. Moreover, repackaged malware and benign apps share more than 80% of their features, which makes detection a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel technique based on multi-view learning to address this challenge of detecting repackaged malware. Multi-View Learning is a technique where data from multiple distinct feature groups, referred to as views, are fused to improve the model’s generalization performance. In the context of Android, we define views as different components of the app, such as permissions, APIs, sensor usage, etc. We analyzed 15,297 repackaged app pairs and extracted seven different views to represent an app. We perform an ablation study to identify which view(s) contribute more to the classification. The model was trained end-to-end to jointly learn appropriate features and to perform the classification. We show that our approach achieves accuracy and an F1-score of 97.46% and 0.98, respectively.},

Anti-malware are not able to detect zero-day malware, because to detect malicious behaviour they need to know its signature, but to have this information the malware must already be widespread. Furthermore, anti-malware are able to scan one application at a time: for this reason a type of malware characterized by the colluding attack, where the malicious action is split in two (or more) applications, can not be recognised. To demonstrate the ineffectiveness of current anti-malware mechanisms in recognizing colluding attacks, in this paper we propose Ste\ae{}lErgon, a framework aimed to inject a malicious payload in two or more different Android applications. Clearly the malicious payload will be executed once all the applications composing the collusive attacks are installed into the infected device. In detail, Ste\ae{}lErgon is able to inject a collusive malicious payload attacking the external storage, allowing the attacker to catch sensitive and private information stored into the infected device. We perform an experimental analysis by submitting the generated colluding application to different 79 anti-malware, by showing that current detection mechanism are not able to detect this kind of threat.

  abstract = {Binary type inference is a critical reverse engineering task supporting many security applications, including vulnerability analysis, binary hardening, forensics, and decompilation. It is a difficult task because source-level type information is often stripped during compilation, leaving only binaries with untyped memory and register accesses. Existing approaches rely on hand-coded type inference rules defined by domain experts, which are brittle and require nontrivial effort to maintain and update. Even though machine learning approaches have shown promise at automatically learning the inference rules, their accuracy is still low, especially for optimized binaries.  We present StateFormer, a new neural architecture that is adept at accurate and robust type inference. StateFormer follows a two-step transfer learning paradigm. In the pretraining step, the model is trained with Generative State Modeling (GSM), a novel task that we design to teach the model to statically approximate execution effects of assembly instructions in both forward and backward directions. In the finetuning step, the pretrained model learns to use its knowledge of operational semantics to infer types.  We evaluate StateFormer's performance on a corpus of 33 popular open-source software projects containing over 1.67 billion variables of different types. The programs are compiled with GCC and LLVM over 4 optimization levels O0-O3, and 3 obfuscation passes based on LLVM. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ML-based tools by 14.6% in recovering types for both function arguments and variables. Our ablation studies show that GSM improves type inference accuracy by 33%.},

  abstract = {The call stack represents one of the core abstractions that compiler-generated programs leverage to organize binary execution at runtime. For many use cases reasoning about stack accesses of binary functions is crucial: security-sensitive applications may require patching even after deployment, and binary instrumentation, rewriting, and lifting all necessitate detailed knowledge about the function frame layout of the affected program. As no comprehensive solution to the stack symbolization problem exists to date, existing approaches have to resort to workarounds like emulated stack environments, resulting in increased runtime overheads.In this paper we present StackBERT, a framework to statically reason about and reliably recover stack frame information of binary functions in stripped and highly optimized programs. The core idea behind our approach is to formulate binary analysis as a self-supervised learning problem by automatically generating ground truth data from a large corpus of open-source programs. We train a state-of-the-art Transformer model with self-attention and finetune for stack frame size prediction. We show that our finetuned model yields highly accurate estimates of a binary function's stack size from its function body alone across different instruction-set architectures, compiler toolchains, and optimization levels. We successfully verify the static estimates against runtime data through dynamic executions of standard benchmarks and additional studies, demonstrating that StackBERT's predictions generalize to 93.44% of stripped and highly optimized test binaries not seen during training. We envision these results to be useful for improving binary rewriting and lifting approaches in the future.},

Its CPS translation generates λ-terms in which continuation composition is not expressed in terms of nested function calls, as is typical of other delimited-control operators, e.g. shift, but with function applications consuming a sequence of continuations one at a time, as if they formed a stack. We present a novel reduction theory for Moggi’s computational λ-calculus extended with shift0 and a control delimiter dollar, which models the capture of evaluation contexts in a fine-grained manner as an interaction between the let-expressions and the delimiter. We establish a connection between our reduction theory and the existing theories of shif0 and dollar. Moreover, we develop a CPS translation for our calculus along with a direct-style translation that together form a reflection, i.e. the translations preserve reductions and the direct-style translation is a right inverse of the CPS translation. This construction relies on the invariant that CPS root terms are in η-head-normal form. The results of this work could potentially be used for compiler optimisations and lead to a similar development for algebraic effects.},

Numerous studies have investigated binary code with the goal of extracting fingerprints that can illuminate the semantics of a target application. However, extracting fingerprints is a challenging task since a substantial amount of significant information will be lost during compilation, notably, variable and function naming, the original data and control flow structures, comments, semantic information, and the code layout. This article provides the first systematic review of existing binary code fingerprinting approaches and the contexts in which they are used. In addition, it discusses the applications that rely on binary code fingerprints, the information that can be captured during the fingerprinting process, and the approaches used and their implementations. It also addresses limitations and open questions related to the fingerprinting process and proposes future directions.},

Over the past five years, decompilers have improved enormously, not only in terms of the readability of the produced pseudocode, but also in terms of similarity of the recovered representation to the original source code. Albeit decompilers are routinely used by reverse engineers in different disciplines (e.g., to support vulnerability discovery or malware analysis), they are not yet adopted to produce input for source-code static analysis tools. In particular, source code vulnerability discovery and binary vulnerability discovery remain today two very different areas of research, despite the fact that decompilers could potentially bridge this gap and enable source-code analysis on binary files.In this paper, we conducted a number of experiments on real world vulnerabilities to evaluate the feasibility of this approach. In particular, our measurements are intended to show how the differences between original and decompiled code impact the accuracy of static analysis tools.Remarkably, our results show that in 71% of the cases, the same vulnerabilities can be detected by running the static analyzers on the decompiled code, even though for several cases we observe a steep increment in the number of false positives. To understand the reasons behind these differences, we manually investigated all cases and we identified a number of root causes that affected the ability of static tools to 'understand' the generated code.},

In the previous research, most detection methods cannot directly locate malicious code, and some methods with the locate ability can only find some specific types of malicious operations. This paper proposed a graph convolution algorithm and weighted mechanism to find malicious nodes implied in the Android application function call graph and provided a general method for malicious code location. We analyzed the sub-graph structural differences between benign code and malicious payload in the function call graph, constructed graph convolution operation to make the nodes in the graph learn the surrounding sub-graph structure, designed the weighting mechanism to set the malicious score to every code node, and filtered out the nodes with the highest malicious score to locate the malicious code fragments. On the dataset composed of 2650 malicious and 2650 benign applications, the accuracy of malware detection is 92.6%, and the accuracy of malicious code location is between 72.6% and 88.1%, indicating that our method is accurate and efficient.},

  abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a service (UAVaaS) has increased the field deployment of Robotic Aerial Vehicles (RAVs) for different services such as transportation and terrain exploration. These RAVs are controlled by firmware, which is often closed-source, developed by vendors, and flashed into the ROM. While these binary blobs enable off-the-shelf management of RAVs, end users (individuals or organizations) have no idea if the control firmware is designed and implemented correctly, and can only rely on firmware updates from vendors when any vulnerability is discovered. This paper proposes DisPatch, the first reverse engineering and patching framework for understanding and improving controller design and implementation within RAV firmware. DisPatch first decompiles binary instructions and recovers controller functions and core controller variables by combining control theory with program analysis using symbolic execution and data flow analysis. End users can then write a patch in a domain-specific language (DSL), which will be translated and injected into the binary firmware by DisPatch automatically. We have applied DisPatch to two instances of commodity firmware from3DR IRIS+ and MantisQ RAVs and demonstrated 100% and 80.7% accuracy respectively in the controller decompilation. We have also shown the ability to prevent severe controller performance degradation by patching two real-world bugs with in the firmware and without breaking other functionality. Finally, we show that DisPatch introduces less than 0.53% of space overhead and 1.48% of runtime overhead without violating the soft real-time deadlines. DisPatch provides the first step towards an RAV binary firmware reverse engineering and patching system to customize controller design and implementation.},

In this paper, we design a novel automated tool, PITracker, to detect the PendingIntent vulnerabilities in Android apps.

  abstract = {The increasing popularity of WebAssembly creates a demand for understanding and reverse engineering WebAssembly binaries. Recovering high-level function types is an important part of this process. One method to recover types is data-flow analysis, but it is complex to implement and may require manual heuristics when logical constraints fall short. In contrast, this paper presents SnowWhite, a learning-based approach for recovering precise, high-level parameter and return types for WebAssembly functions. It improves over prior work on learning-based type recovery by representing the types-to-predict in an expressive type language, which can describe a large number of complex types, instead of the fixed, and usually small type vocabulary used previously. Thus, recovery of a single type is no longer a classification task but sequence prediction, for which we build on the success of neural sequence-to-sequence models. We evaluate SnowWhite on a new, large-scale dataset of 6.3 million type samples extracted from 300,905 WebAssembly object files. The results show the type language is expressive, precisely describing 1,225 types instead the 7 to 35 types considered in previous learning-based approaches. Despite this expressiveness, our type recovery has high accuracy, exactly matching 44.5% (75.2%) of all parameter types and 57.7% (80.5%) of all return types within the top-1 (top-5) predictions.},

In this paper, we present the first approach to provably overapproximative x86-64 binary lifting. A stripped binary is verified for certain sanity properties such as return address integrity and calling convention adherence. Establishing these properties allows the binary to be lifted to a representation that contains an overapproximation of all possible execution paths of the binary. The lifted representation contains disassembled instructions, reconstructed control flow, invariants and proof obligations that are sufficient to prove the sanity properties as well as correctness of the lifted representation. We apply this approach to Linux Foundation and Intel’s Xen Hypervisor covering about 400K instructions. This demonstrates our approach is the first approach to provably overapproximative binary lifting scalable to commercial off-the-shelf systems. The lifted representation is exportable to the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, allowing formal verification of its correctness. If our technique succeeds and the proofs obligations are proven true, then – under the generated assumptions – the lifted representation is correct.},

  abstract = {The emergence of new architectures create a recurring challenge to ensure that existing programs still work on them. Manually porting legacy code is often impractical. Static binary translation (SBT) is a process where a program’s binary is automatically translated from one architecture to another, while preserving their original semantics. However, these SBT tools have limited support to various advanced architectural features. Importantly, they are currently unable to translate concurrent binaries. The main challenge arises from the mismatches of the memory consistency model specified by the different architectures, especially when porting existing binaries to a weak memory model architecture. In this paper, we propose Lasagne, an end-to-end static binary translator with precise translation rules between x86 and Arm concurrency semantics. First, we propose a concurrency model for Lasagne’s intermediate representation (IR) and formally proved mappings between the IR and the two architectures. The memory ordering is preserved by introducing fences in the translated code. Finally, we propose optimizations focused on raising the level of abstraction of memory address calculations and reducing the number of fences. Our evaluation shows that Lasagne reduces the number of fences by up to about 65%, with an average reduction of 45.5%, significantly reducing their runtime overhead.},

  abstract = {Edge computing is a recent computing paradigm that brings cloud services closer to the client. Among other features, edge computing offers extremely low client/server latencies. To consistently provide such low latencies, services should run on edge nodes that are physically as close as possible to their clients. Thus, when the physical location of a client changes, a service should migrate between edge nodes to maintain proximity. Differently from cloud nodes, edge nodes integrate CPUs of different Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), hence a program natively compiled for a given ISA cannot migrate to a server equipped with a CPU of a different ISA. This hinders migration to the closest node.We introduce H-Container, a system that migrates natively compiled containerized applications across compute nodes featuring CPUs of different ISAs. H-Container advances over existing heterogeneous-ISA migration systems by being (a) highly compatible – no user’s source-code nor compiler toolchain modifications are needed; (b) easily deployable – fully implemented in user space, thus without any OS or hypervisor dependency, and (c) largely Linux-compliant – it can migrate most Linux software, including server applications and dynamically linked binaries. H-Container targets Linux and its already-compiled executables, adopts LLVM, extends CRIU, and integrates with Docker. Experiments demonstrate that H-Container adds no overheads during program execution, while 10–100&nbsp;ms are added during migration. Furthermore, we show the benefits of H-Container in real-world scenarios, demonstrating, for example, up to 94% increase in Redis throughput when client/server proximity is maintained through heterogeneous container migration.},

  abstract = {With the increasing popularity of blockchain, automatically detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts is becoming a significant problem. Prior research mainly identifies smart contract vulnerabilities without considering the interactions between multiple contracts. Due to the lack of analyzing the fine-grained contextual information during cross-contract invocations, existing approaches often produced a large number of false positives and false negatives. This paper proposes SmartDagger, a new framework for detecting cross-contract vulnerability through static analysis at the bytecode level. SmartDagger integrates a set of novel mechanisms to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency for cross-contract vulnerability detection. Particularly, SmartDagger effectively recovers the contract attribute information from the smart contract bytecode, which is critical for accurately identifying cross-contract vulnerabilities. Besides, instead of performing the typical whole-program analysis which is heavy-weight and time-consuming, SmartDagger selectively analyzes a subset of functions and reuses the data-flow results, which helps to improve its efficiency. Our further evaluation over a manually labelled dataset showed that SmartDagger significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art tools (i.e., Oyente, Slither, Osiris, and Mythril) for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities. In addition, running SmartDagger over a randomly selected dataset of 250 smart contracts in the real-world, SmartDagger detects 11 cross-contract vulnerabilities, all of which are missed by prior tools.},

Therefore, the detection and management of vulnerabilities through code similarity detection technology is of great significance for protecting the security of IoT devices. Aim: We aim to propose a more accurate, parallel-friendly, and realistic software supply chain vulnerability detection solution for IoT devices. Method: This paper presents PG-VulNet, standing for Vulnerability-detection Network based on Pseudo-code Graphs. It is a ”multi-model” cross-architecture vulnerability detection solution based on pseudo-code and Graph Matching Network (GMN). PG-VulNet extracts both behavioral and structural features of pseudo-code to build customized feature graphs and then uses GMN to detect supply chain vulnerabilities based on these graphs. Results: The experiments show that PG-VulNet achieves an average detection accuracy of 99.14%, significantly higher than existing approaches like Gemini, VulSeeker, FIT, and Asteria. In addition to this, PG-VulNet also excels in detection overhead and false alarms. In the real-world evaluation, PG-VulNet detected 690 known vulnerabilities in 1,611 firmwares. Conclusions: PG-VulNet can effectively detect the vulnerabilities introduced by software supply chain in IoT firmwares and is well suited for large-scale detection. Compared with existing approaches, PG-VulNet has significant advantages.},

  abstract = {The Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is a rich language for modeling embedded systems through several constructs such as component extension and refinement to promote modularity of component declarations. To ease processing AADL models, OSATE, the reference tool for AADL, defines another model (namely 'instance' model) computed from a base 'declarative' model/s. An instance model is a simple object tree where all information from the declarative model is flattened so that tools can easily use this information to analyze the system. However for modifications, they have to make changes in the complex declarative model since there is no automated backward transformation (deinstantiation) from instance to declarative models. Since the instance model is a 'view' of the declarative model, this is a view-update problem. In this paper, we propose the OSATE Declarative-Instance Mapping Tool (OSATE-DIM1), an Eclipse plugin for deinstantiation of AADL models implementing a solution of this view-update problem. We evaluate OSATE-DIM with a benchmark of existing AADL model processing tools and verify the correctness of our deinstantiation transformations. We also discuss how our approach could be useful for decompilation of Object-Oriented languages' intermediate representations.},

Our key insight is that the knowledge of event-activity transitions from the previous testing runs, i.e., executing which events can reach which activities, is valuable for guiding the follow-up testing runs to quickly cover major app functionalities. To this end, we propose (1) a probabilistic model to memorize and leverage this knowledge during testing, and (2) design a model-based guided testing strategy (enhanced by a reinforcement learning algorithm). We implemented our technique as an automated testing tool named Fastbot2. The evaluation on two popular industrial apps (with billions of user installations), Douyin and Toutiao, shows that Fastbot2 outperforms the state-of-the-art testing tools (Monkey, Ape and Stoat) in both activity coverage and fault detection in the context of continuous testing. To date, Fastbot2 has been deployed in the CI pipeline at ByteDance for nearly two years, and 50.8% of the developer-fixed crash bugs were reported by Fastbot2, which significantly improves app quality.

  abstract = {More apps are published every day and the functionality of each app increases steadily as well. Consequently app analyses are often overwhelmed when confronted with up-to-date, real-world apps. One of the biggest issues originates from the scalability of analyses with respect to libraries. Analyses, more precisely the tools implementing them, cannot distinguish the app’s code from the code of a library. Always analyzing the whole code base is the result. However, this is usually not necessary, for example, when a security property is checked, trusted libraries must not be analyzed. We propose an approach to differentiate an app’s code from a library’s code. The approach is based on clone detection and implemented in our prototype APK-Simplifier. As the evaluation shows APK-Simplifier can be employed in a cooperative analysis to remove library code and to enhance arbitrary analysis tools’ scalability. In fact, five analysis tools have been enabled to analyze five up-to-date, real-world apps they could not analyze before. Still, it is alerting that the majority of such apps remains not analyzable as also shown during evaluation.},

  abstract = {With the popularity of Android mobile devices and the increase of related applications, hackers regard it as the primary attack target. Therefore, malware detection is essential nowadays, and many of these studies employ deep learning techniques. In recent years, the attention mechanism provides corresponding attention weights for different hidden states, and it is widely used in many fields, such as machine translation and image markup. However, no research has applied the attention mechanism to Android malware analysis. Hence, this paper completes the goal of malware family classification based on the static features of Android applications. We compare the difference between the original convolutional neural network (CNN) and the addition of the attention mechanism. The final experimental results show that the attention mechanism improves the accuracy of the existing CNN model by 1.99% in static opcode images. In addition, we further adopt the occlusion sensitivity method to try to explain the classification model proposed in this paper. Finally, the experimental results of model interpretation show that the classification model can effectively identify the threat behavior of malware.},

  abstract = {Manually writing parallel programs is difficult and error-prone.   Automatic parallelization could address this issue, but profitability can be limited by not having facts known only to the programmer.   A parallelizing compiler that collaborates with the programmer can increase the coverage and performance of parallelization while reducing the errors and overhead associated with manual parallelization.   Unlike collaboration involving analysis tools that report program properties or make parallelization suggestions to the programmer, decompiler-based collaboration could leverage the strength of existing parallelizing compilers to provide programmers with a natural compiler-parallelized starting point for further parallelization or refinement.  Despite this potential, existing decompilers fail to do this because they do not generate portable parallel source code compatible with any compiler of the source language.  This paper presents SPLENDID, an LLVM-IR to C/OpenMP decompiler that enables collaborative parallelization by producing standard parallel OpenMP code.   Using published manual parallelization of the PolyBench benchmark suite as a reference, SPLENDID's collaborative approach produces programs twice as fast as either Polly-based automatic parallelization or manual parallelization alone.   SPLENDID's portable parallel code is also more natural than that from existing decompilers, obtaining a 39x higher average BLEU score.},

  abstract = {While third-party libraries (TPLs) are extensively reused to enhance productivity during software development, they can also introduce potential security risks such as vulnerability propagation. Software composition analysis (SCA), proposed to identify reused TPLs for reducing such risks, has become an essential procedure within modern DevSecOps. As one of the mainstream SCA techniques, binary-to-source SCA identifies the third-party source projects contained in binary files via binary source code matching, which is a major challenge in reverse engineering since binary and source code exhibit substantial disparities after compilation. The existing binary-to-source SCA techniques leverage basic syntactic features that suffer from redundancy and lack robustness in the large-scale TPL dataset, leading to inevitable false positives and compromised recall. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce BinaryAI, a novel binary-to-source SCA technique with two-phase binary source code matching to capture both syntactic and semantic code features. First, BinaryAI trains a transformer-based model to produce function-level embeddings and obtain similar source functions for each binary function accordingly. Then by applying the link-time locality to facilitate function matching, BinaryAI detects the reused TPLs based on the ratio of matched source functions. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BinaryAI in terms of binary source code matching and the downstream SCA task. Specifically, our embedding model outperforms the state-of-the-art model CodeCMR, i.e., achieving 22.54% recall@1 and 0.34 MRR compared with 10.75% and 0.17 respectively. Additionally, BinaryAI outperforms all existing binary-to-source SCA tools in TPL detection, increasing the precision from 73.36% to 85.84% and recall from 59.81% to 64.98% compared with the well-recognized commercial SCA product Black Duck.https://www.binaryai.net},

  abstract = {As an essential component in Ethereum and other blockchains, token assets have been interacted with by diverse smart contracts. Effective permission policies of smart contracts must prevent token assets from being manipulated by unauthorized adversaries. Recent efforts have studied the accessibility of privileged functions or state variables to unauthorized users. However, little attention is paid to how publicly accessible functions of smart contracts can be manipulated by adversaries to steal users' digital assets. This attack is mainly caused by the permission re-delegation (PRD) vulnerability. In this work, we propose PrettySmart, a bytecode-level Permission re-delegation vulnerability detector for Smart contracts. Our study begins with an empirical study on 0.43 million open-source smart contracts, revealing that five types of widely-used permission constraints dominate 98% of the studied contracts. Accordingly, we propose a mechanism to infer these permission constraints, as well as an algorithm to identify constraints that can be bypassed by unauthorized adversaries. Based on the identification of permission constraints, we propose to detect whether adversaries could manipulate the privileged token management functionalities of smart contracts. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PrettySmart, which achieves the highest precision score and detects 118 new PRD vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {Reentrancy, a notorious vulnerability in smart contracts, has led to millions of dollars in financial loss. However, current smart contract vulnerability detection tools suffer from a high false positive rate in identifying contracts with reentrancy vulnerabilities. Moreover, only a small portion of the detected reentrant contracts can actually be exploited by hackers, making these tools less effective in securing the Ethereum ecosystem in practice.In this paper, we propose BlockWatchdog, a tool that focuses on detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying attacker contracts. These attacker contracts are deployed by hackers to exploit vulnerable contracts automatically. By focusing on attacker contracts, BlockWatchdog effectively detects truly exploitable reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying reentrant call flow. Additionally, BlockWatchdog is capable of detecting new types of reentrancy vulnerabilities caused by poor designs when using ERC tokens or user-defined interfaces, which cannot be detected by current rule-based tools. We implement BlockWatchdog using cross-contract static dataflow techniques based on attack logic obtained from an empirical study that analyzes attacker contracts from 281 attack incidents. BlockWatchdog is evaluated on 421,889 Ethereum contract bytecodes and identifies 113 attacker contracts that target 159 victim contracts, leading to the theft of Ether and tokens valued at approximately 908.6 million USD. Notably, only 18 of the identified 159 victim contracts can be reported by current reentrancy detection tools.},

Software   written in different high-level programming languages are compiled into wasm   executables, which can be executed fast and safely in a virtual machine. The   performance of wasm executables depends highly on compiler optimizations.   Despite the prosperous use of wasm executables, recent research has indicated   that real-world wasm applications are slower than anticipated, suggesting   deficiencies in wasm optimizations.    This paper aims to present the first systematic and in-depth understanding of   the status quo of wasm optimizations. To do so, we present DITWO, a   differential testing framework to uncover missed optimizations   (MO) of wasm optimizers. DITWO compiles a C program into both   native x86 executable and wasm executable, and differentiates   optimization indication traces (OITraces) logged by running each   executable to uncover MO. Each OITrace is composed with global variable writes   and function calls, two performance indicators that practically and   systematically reflect the optimization degree across wasm and native   executables.   Our analysis of the official wasm optimizer, wasm-opt, successfully   identifies 1,293 inputs triggering MO of wasm-opt. With extensive manual effort, we  identify nine root causes for all MO, and we estimate that fixing discovered MO   can result in a performance improvement of at least 17.15%. We also summarize   four lessons from our findings to deliver better wasm optimizations.},

The first mechanism is to construct a call graph for inter-contract taint analysis by restoring call information, not only from code constants but also from contract storage and function parameters. The second mechanism is a high-level semantic induction tailored for detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities, which accurately identifies taint sources and sinks and tracks taint data across contracts. Extensive evaluation of real-world incidents and high-value DeFi protocols shows that DeFiTainter outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance with a precision of 96% and a recall of 91.3% in detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities. Furthermore, DeFiTainter uncovers three previously undisclosed price manipulation vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts play an increasingly important role in Ethereum platform. It provides various functions implementing numerous services, whose bytecode runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine. To use services by invoking corresponding functions, the callers need to know the function signatures. Moreover, such signatures provide crucial information for many downstream applications, e.g., identifying smart contracts, fuzzing, detecting vulnerabilities, etc. However, it is challenging to infer function signatures from the bytecode due to a lack of type information. Existing work solving this problem depended heavily on limited databases or hard-coded heuristic patterns. However, these approaches are hard to be adapted to semantic differences in distinct languages and various compiler versions when developing smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework DeepInfer that first leverages deep learning techniques to automatically infer function signatures and returns. The novelties of DeepInfer are: 1) DeepInfer lifts the bytecode into the Intermediate Representation (IR) to preserve code semantics; 2) DeepInfer extracts the type-related knowledge (e.g., critical data flows, constant values, and control flow graphs) from the IR to recover function signatures and returns. We conduct experiments on Solidity and Vyper smart contracts and the results show that DeepInfer performs faster and more accurate than existing tools, while being immune to changes in different languages and various compiler versions.},

In such a heterogeneous computing architecture, the legacy software should be redesigned and re-engineered to utilize new CIM accelerators. In this article, we propose a compilation tool to automatically migrate legacy programs to such heterogeneous architectures based on the low-level virtual machine (LLVM) compiler infrastructure. To accelerate some computations such as vector-matrix multiplication in CIM accelerators, we identify several typical computing patterns from LLVM intermediate representations, which are oblivious to high-level programming paradigms. Our compilation tool can modify accelerable LLVM IRs to offload them to CIM accelerators automatically, without re-engineering legacy software. Experimental results show that our compilation tool can translate many legacy programs to CIM-supported binary executables effectively, and improve application performance and energy efficiency by up to 51\texttimes{} and 309\texttimes{}, respectively, compared with general-purpose x86 processors.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a process of converting a low-level machine code snippet back into a high-level programming language such as C. It serves as a basis to aid reverse engineers in comprehending the contextual semantics of the code. In this respect, commercial decompilers like Hex-Rays have made significant strides in improving the readability of decompiled code over time. While previous work has proposed the metrics for assessing the readability of source code, including identifiers, variable names, function names, and comments, those metrics are unsuitable for measuring the readability of decompiled code primarily due to i) the lack of rich semantic information in the source and ii) the presence of erroneous syntax or inappropriate expressions. In response, to the best of our knowledge, this work first introduces R2I, the Relative Readability Index, a specialized metric tailored to evaluate decompiled code in a relative context quantitatively. In essence, R2I can be computed by i) taking code snippets across different decompilers as input and ii) extracting pre-defined features from an abstract syntax tree. For the robustness of R2I, we thoroughly investigate the enhancement efforts made by (non-)commercial decompilers and academic research to promote code readability, identifying 31 features to yield a reliable index collectively. Besides, we conducted a user survey to capture subjective factors such as one’s coding styles and preferences. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that R2I is a versatile metric capable of representing the relative quality of decompiled code (e.g., obfuscation, decompiler updates) and being well aligned with human perception in our survey.},

We assume that the on-device firmware is inaccessible, e.g., read-protected. We focus on the combination of information that can be extracted from analyzing the app and the local communication between the app and the IoT device. An attacker can trivially obtain the app, analyze its operation, and potentially eavesdrop on the wireless communication occurring during the setup phase. We develop a semi-automated general methodology involving off-the-shelf tools to examine information disclosure during the setup phase. We tested our methodology on twenty commodity-grade IoT devices. The outcome reveals a wide range of device-dependent choices for encryption at various layers and the potential for exposure of, among other things, device-identifying information and local networking (WiFi) credentials.

  abstract = {Fuzzing is an effective method for detecting security bugs in software, and there have been quite a few effective works on fuzzing Android. Researchers have developed methods for fuzzing open-source native APIs and Java interfaces on actual Android devices. However, the realm of automatically fuzzing Android closed-source native libraries, particularly on emulators, remains insufficiently explored. There are two key challenges: firstly, the multi-language programming model inherent to Android; and secondly, the absence of a Java runtime environment within the emulator.                 To address these challenges, we propose Atlas, a practical automated fuzz framework for Android closed-source native libraries. Atlas consists of an automatic harness generator and a fuzzer containing the necessary runtime environment. The generator uses static analysis techniques to deduce the correct calling sequences and parameters of the native API according to the information from the "native world" and the "Java world". To maximize the practicality of the generated harness, Atlas heuristically optimizes the generated harness. The Fuzzer provides the essential Java runtime environment in the emulator, making it possible to fuzz the Android closed-source native libraries on a multi-core server. We have tested Atlas on 17 pre-installed apps from four Android vendors. Atlas generates 820 harnesses containing 767 native APIs, of which 78% is practical. Meanwhile, Atlas has discovered 74 new security bugs with 16 CVEs assigned. The experiments show that Atlas can efficiently generate high-quality harnesses and find security bugs.},

  abstract = {In software security tasks like malware analysis and vulnerability mining, reverse engineering is pivotal, with C decompilers playing a crucial role in understanding program semantics. However, reverse engineers still predominantly rely on assembly code rather than decompiled code when analyzing complex binaries. This practice underlines the limitations of current decompiled code, which hinders its effectiveness in reverse engineering. Identifying and analyzing the problems of existing decompilers and making targeted improvements can effectively enhance the efficiency of software analysis. In this study, we systematically evaluate current mainstream decompilers’ semantic consistency and readability. Semantic evaluation results show that the state-of-the-art decompiler Hex-Rays has about 55% accuracy at almost all optimization, which contradicts the common belief among many reverse engineers that decompilers are usually accurate. Readability evaluation indicates that despite years of efforts to improve the readability of the decompiled code, decompilers’ template-based approach still predominantly yields code akin to binary structures rather than human coding patterns. Additionally, our human study indicates that to enhance decompilers’ accuracy and readability, introducing human or compiler-aware strategies like a speculate-verify-correct approach to obtain recompilable decompiled code and iteratively refine it to more closely resemble the original binary, potentially offers a more effective optimization method than relying on static analysis and rule expansion.},

Resolving these indirect jumps is critical for constructing a complete control-flow graph, which is an essential first step for most applications involving binaries, including binary hardening and instrumentation, binary analysis and fuzzing for vulnerability discovery, malware analysis and reverse engineering. Existing techniques for jump table analysis generally prioritize performance over soundness. While lack of soundness may be acceptable for applications such as decompilation, it can cause unpredictable runtime failures in binary instrumentation applications. We therefore present SJA, a new jump table analysis technique in this paper that is sound and scalable. Our analysis uses a novel abstract domain to systematically track the "structure" of computed code pointers without relying on syntactic pattern-matching that is common in previous works. In addition, we present a bounds analysis that efficiently and losslessly reasons about equality and inequality relations that arise in the context of jump tables. As a result, our system reduces miss rate by 35\texttimes{} over the next best technique. When evaluated on error rate based on F1-score, our technique outperforms the best previous techniques by 3\texttimes{}.},

Aiming at the shortcomings of the pseudocode abstract syntax tree being difficult to extract and the binary function naming scheme having low accuracy rate, a binary function naming prediction model A2N based on variable alignment and sequence translation model is proposed. First, A2N extracts the function variable features of binary files from debugging information and performs variable alignment with the pseudocode obtained from decompiling; then, it obtains the hierarchical structure of the binary functions and designs the node extraction rules to generate an abstract syntax tree AST for each function; then, extract the paths between the leaf nodes of the AST and serialize the tree structure to represent it; finally, with the help of the neural network translation model, establish a mapping between the AST and the binary function names to realize the prediction function. The experimental results show that compared with Dire, Nero and XFL models, the F1 value of A2N is improved by 84%, 44% and 14% on file-level isolation experiments respectively, and the F1 value reaches 80.94% on function-level isolation experiments.},

When it is obfuscated to avoid detection, making it harder to repack and classify. State-of-the-art Android repackaged app classification approaches heavily rely on manually extracting dependency features as fingerprints. In this paper, we present a novel Android app repackaging classification method that utilizes the proposed EDA model to learn the semantic and sequence context information from smali embedding. It is extracted automatically from decompiled android .smali files. We leverage the high-frequency attention of embedding encoding to quickly identify public library subsequences. And our model uses intra-sequence attention for encoding between opcode embeddings within each .smali file to capture richer embedding encoding vectors. We make experiments on 8,000 android app pairs downloaded by Androzoo dataset. The results demonstrate that our method achieves 87.53% accuracy for repackaged apps classification. It can effectively capture context between sequences, and exhibits better training and detection efficiency than time series-based deep neural network learning model.},

A prominent challenge is to recover variable symbols, including both primitive and complex types such as user-defined data structures, along with their symbol information such as names and types. Existing efforts focus on solving parts of the problem, e.g., recovering only types (without names) or only local variables (without user-defined structures). In this paper, we propose ReSym, a novel hybrid technique that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and program analysis to recover both names and types for local variables and user-defined data structures. Our method encompasses fine-tuning two LLMs to handle local variables and structures, respectively. To overcome the token limitations inherent in current LLMs, we devise a novel Prolog-based algorithm to aggregate and cross-check results from multiple LLM queries, suppressing uncertainty and hallucinations. Our experiments show that ReSym is effective in recovering variable information and user-defined data structures, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.},

The produced NASM is recompilable, and we extensively test the recompiled binaries to see if they exhibit the same behavior as the original ones. In addition to testing, the produced NASM is accompanied with a certificate, constructed in such a way that if all theorems in the certificate hold, symbolization has occurred correctly.

  abstract = {Writing distributed applications is hard, as the programmer needs to describe the communication protocol between the different endpoints. If this is not done correctly, we can introduce bugs such as deadlocks and data races.  Tierless and choreographic programming models aim to make this easier by describing the interactions of every endpoint in a single compilation unit. When such a program is compiled, ideally, a single endpoint is projected and the code for the other endpoints is removed. This leads to smaller binaries with fewer dependencies, and is called program partitioning. In this pearl, we show how we can use rewrite rules and specialisation to get GHC to partition our Haskell programs (almost) for free, if they are written using the Haste App or HasChor framework.  As an example of why partitioning is useful, we show how an example application can be more easily built and deployed after being partitioned.},

  abstract = {Specifying and implementing a proof system from scratch requires significant effort. Logical Frameworks and Higher Order Logic Programming Languages provide dedicated, high-level meta languages to facilitate this task in two ways: 1) variable binding and substitution are for free when meta language binders represent object logic ones; 2) proof construction, and proof search, are greatly simplified by leveraging the unification procedure provided by the meta language. Notable examples of meta languages are Elf&nbsp;[21], Twelf&nbsp;[23], λ Prolog&nbsp;[16], Beluga&nbsp;[24], Abella&nbsp;[8] and Isabelle&nbsp;[31] which have been used to implement or specify many formal systems such as First Order Logic&nbsp;[5], Set Theory&nbsp;[20], Higher Order Logic&nbsp;[19], and the Calculus of Constructions&nbsp;[4]. The object logic we are interested in is Coq’s type theory&nbsp;[28]. We aim to develop a higher-order unification-based proof search procedure using the meta language Elpi&nbsp;[3], a dialect of λ Prolog. Elpi’s equational theory includes βη -equivalence and features a higher-order unification procedure ≃ m for the pattern fragment&nbsp;[15]. Elpi offers an encoding of Coq terms that is suitable for meta programming&nbsp;[6, 9, 26, 27] but that restricts ≃ m to first-order unification problems only. We refer to this basic encoding as &lt;Formula format="inline"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX $mathcal {O}$?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 1&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name="ppdp2024-1-inline1" type="svg"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt;. In this paper we translate unification problems in &lt;Formula format="inline"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX $mathcal {O}$?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 2&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name="ppdp2024-1-inline2" type="svg"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt; to an alternative encoding called &lt;Formula format="inline"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX $mathcal {M}$?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 3&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name="ppdp2024-1-inline3" type="svg"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt;, from which we derive ≃ o, the higher-order unification procedure of &lt;Formula format="inline"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX $mathcal {O}$?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 4&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name="ppdp2024-1-inline4" type="svg"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt;. ≃ o honours βη -equivalence for terms within the pattern fragment, and allows for the use of heuristics when the terms fall outside the pattern fragment. Moreover, as ≃ o delegates most of the work to ≃ m, it can be used to efficiently simulate a logic program in &lt;Formula format="inline"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX $mathcal {O}$?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 5&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name="ppdp2024-1-inline5" type="svg"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt; by taking advantage of unification-related optimizations of the meta language, such as clause indexing.},

  abstract = {Malware analysis tasks are as fundamental for modern cybersecurity as they are challenging to perform. More than depending on any tool capability, malware analysis tasks depend on human analysts’ abilities, experiences, and practices when using the tools. Academic research has traditionally been focused on producing solutions to overcome malware analysis technical challenges, but are these solutions adopted in practice by malware analysts? Are these solutions useful? If not, how can the academic community improve its practices to foster adoption and cause a greater impact? To answer these questions, we surveyed 21 professional malware analysts working in different companies, from CSIRTs to AV companies, to hear their opinions about existing tools, practices, and the challenges they face in their daily tasks. In 31 questions, we cover a broad range of aspects, from the number of observed malware variants to the use of public sandboxes and the tools the analysts would like to exist to make their lives easier. We aim to bridge the gap between academic developments and malware practices. To do so, on the one hand, we suggest to the analysts the solutions proposed in the literature that could be integrated into their practices. On the other hand, we also point out to the academic community possible future directions to bridge existing development gaps that significantly affect malware analysis practices.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, the threat of malware has become increasingly evident, posing a significant risk to cybersecurity worldwide and driving extensive research efforts to prevent and mitigate these attacks. Despite numerous efforts to automate malware analysis, these systems are constantly thwarted by evasive techniques developed by malware authors. As a result, the analysis of sophisticated evasive malware falls into the hands of human malware analysts, who must undertake the time-consuming process of overcoming each evasive technique to uncover malware’s malicious behaviors. This highlights the need for approaches that aid malware analysts in this process. Although active measures, such as forced execution and symbolic analysis, can automatically circumvent some evasive checks, they suffer from limitations like path explosion and fail to provide useful insights that analysts can use in their workflow. To fill this gap, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can address shortcomings of symbolic analysis through the first comparative analysis between the two in bypassing evasion techniques. Our study leads to three key findings: (i) we find that LLMs outperform symbolic analysis in bypassing evasive code, especially in the presence of common code patterns, such as loops, which have historically posed a challenge for symbolic analysis, (ii) we show that LLMs correctly identify methods of bypassing evasive techniques in real-world malware, and (iii) we highlight how even in LLMs failure modes, human malware analysts can benefit from the step-by-step reasoning provided by the model.},

  abstract = {Patch presence test is critical in software security to ensure that binary files have been patched for known vulnerabilities. It is challenging due to the semantic gap between the source code and the binary, and the small and subtle nature of patches. In this paper, we propose React, the first patch presence test approach on IR-level. Based on the IR code compiled from the source code and the IR code lifted from the binary, we first extract four types of feature (return value, condition, function call, and memory store) by executing the program symbolically. Then, we refine the features from the source code and rank them. Finally, we match the features to determine the presence of a patch with an SMT solver to check the equivalence of features at the semantic level.To evaluate our approach, we compare it with state-of-the-art approaches, BinXray and PS3, on a dataset containing binaries compiled from different compilers and optimization levels. Our experimental results show that React achieves scores of 0.88, 0.98, and 0.93, in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively. React outperforms the baselines by 39% and 12% in terms of the F1 score, while the testing speed of our approach is 2x faster than BinXray and 100x faster than PS3. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of each component in React, which shows that SMT solver and refinement can contribute to 16% and 10% improvement in terms of the F1 score, respectively.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of pre-trained models (PTMs) and datasets has led to the emergence of centralized model hubs like Hugging Face, which facilitate collaborative development and reuse. However, recent security reports have uncovered vulnerabilities and instances of malicious attacks within these platforms, highlighting growing security concerns. This paper presents the first systematic study of malicious code poisoning attacks on pre-trained model hubs, focusing on the Hugging Face platform. We conduct a comprehensive threat analysis, develop a taxonomy of model formats, and perform root cause analysis of vulnerable formats. While existing tools like Fickling and ModelScan offer some protection, they face limitations in semantic-level analysis and comprehensive threat detection. To address these challenges, we propose MalHug, an end-to-end pipeline tailored for Hugging Face that combines dataset loading script extraction, model deserialization, in-depth taint analysis, and heuristic pattern matching to detect and classify malicious code poisoning attacks in datasets and models. In collaboration with Ant Group, a leading financial technology company, we have implemented and deployed MalHug on a mirrored Hugging Face instance within their infrastructure, where it has been operational for over three months. During this period, MalHug has monitored more than 705K models and 176K datasets, uncovering 91 malicious models and 9 malicious dataset loading scripts. These findings reveal a range of security threats, including reverse shell, browser credential theft, and system reconnaissance. This work not only bridges a critical gap in understanding the security of the PTM supply chain but also provides a practical, industry-tested solution for enhancing the security of pre-trained model hubs.},

Traditional analysis methods are limited by software complexity and emerging types in real-world projects. To address these limitations, machine learning methods have been explored. However, the existing supervised learning approaches struggle with analyzing complicated and uncommon types due to the limited availability of samples. Additionally, none of the existing works can capture fine-grained and inter-procedural features in the binaries. In this paper, we present TypeFSL, a framework that addresses the challenge of imbalanced type distributions by incorporating few-shot learning and captures inter-procedural semantics through program slicing. Moreover, based on a dataset with 3,003,117 functions, TypeFSL achieves an average of 77.9% and 84.6% accuracy across all architecture and optimizations in 20-way 5-shot and 10-shot classification tasks. Our prototype outperforms existing techniques in prediction accuracy and obfuscation resistance. Finally, the case studies demonstrate how TypeFSL predicts uncommon and complicated types in practical analysis.},

Despite stringent regulations like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), many applications (apps) fail to comply with these legal requirements. While previous studies have focused on the compliance of privacy policies, checking how these policies are implemented in the actual code has not yet been extensively investigated. Moreover, previous efforts have often been limited in scope.This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the challenge of verifying privacy regulation compliance in Android apps. Specifically, we address scenarios where source code is unavailable by investigating whether LLM can work with Smali code—a human-readable representation of Android byte-code extracted from APK files. Through this exploratory investigation, we aim to uncover if LLMs can bridge the gap between legal privacy requirements and their technical implementation in mobile apps. Through initial experiments, we assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a straightforward LLM-driven method for identifying compliance issues and provide directions for our future research efforts to improve our approach and perform large-scale experiments.},

Despite a multitude of malware detection systems, skilled developers of malicious software adeptly conceal harmful code within applications, thus eluding standard detection techniques. A significant challenge in Android application reverse engineering is the extraction of critical code from ".so" files, known as native code, which is often viewed as a secure and clandestine strategy in Android development. Addressing this challenge, our research introduces a novel Android malware detection approach that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to scrutinize native code opcodes. By decompressing Android Application Packages (APKs) and extracting opcodes from shared libraries, we utilize the tf-idf algorithm for feature selection, facilitating the detection of obscured malicious code in a static analysis context. This methodology, bolstered by LSTM training, constructs a formidable framework for Android malware detection.

Previous studies disregarded React Native, resulting in insufficient static analysis of React Native app code. This study initiates the investigation of challenges when statically analyzing React Native apps. We propose ReuNify to improve Soot-based static analysis coverage for JavaScript-side and native-side code. ReuNify converts Hermes bytecode to Soot’s intermediate representation. Hermes bytecode, compiled from JavaScript code and integrated into React Native apps, possesses a unique syntax that eludes current JavaScript analyzers. Additionally, we investigate opcode distribution and conduct in-depth analyses of the usage of opcode between popular apps and malware. We also propose a benchmark consisting of 97 control flow-related cases to validate the control flow recovery of the generated intermediate representation. Furthermore, we model the cross-language communication mechanisms of React Native to expand the static analysis coverage for native-side code. Our evaluation demonstrates that ReuNify enables an average increase of 84% in reached nodes within the callgraph and further identifies an average of two additional privacy leaks in taint analysis. In summary, this article demonstrates that ReuNify significantly improves the static analysis for the React Native Android apps.},

Decompiled Android malware code presents unique challenges for analysis, due to the malicious logic being buried within a large number of functions and the frequent lack of meaningful function names.This paper presents Cama, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis. Cama specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics—consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance—enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison.We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use Cama to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis.},

Despite progress in publishing benchmarks to evaluate APR tools, datasets specifically targeting Android are lacking.To address this gap, we introduce a dataset of 272 real-world violations of Google's Android Security Best Practices, identified by statically analyzing 113 real-world Android apps. In addition to the faulty code, we manually crafted repairs based on Google's guidelines, covering 176 Java-based and 96 XML-based violations from Android Java classes and Manifest files, respectively. Additionally, we leveraged our novel dataset to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as they are the latest promising APR tools. In particular, we evaluated GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini in Android Studio and we found that GPT-4o outperforms Google's models, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness across a range of violations types. Hence, with this dataset, we aim to provide valuable insights for advancing APR research and improving tools for Android security.},

  abstract = {The current landscape of binary code summarization predominantly focuses on generating a single summary, which limits its utility and understanding for reverse engineers. Existing approaches often fail to meet the diverse needs of users, such as providing detailed insights into usage patterns, implementation nuances, and design rationale, as observed in the field of source code summarization. This highlights the need for multi-intent binary code summarization to enhance the effectiveness of reverse engineering processes. To address this gap, we propose MiSum, a novel method that leverages multi-modality heterogeneous code graph alignment and learning to integrate both assembly code and pseudo-code. MiSum introduces a unified multi-modality heterogeneous code graph (MM-HCG) that aligns assembly code graphs with pseudo-code graphs, capturing both low-level execution details and high-level structural information. We further propose multi-modality heterogeneous graph learning with heterogeneous mutual attention and message passing, which highlights important code blocks and discovers inter-dependencies across different code forms. Additionally, an intent-aware summary generator with an intent-aware attention mechanism is introduced to produce customized summaries tailored to multiple intents. Extensive experiments, including evaluations across various architectures and optimization levels, demonstrate that MiSum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics. Human evaluations validate its capability to effectively support reverse engineers in understanding diverse binary code intents, marking a significant advancement in binary code analysis.},

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of Python has spurred interest in decompiling Python PYC bytecode. This work presents the first large-scale study on human-assisted Python decompilation in the wild, leveraging extensive data from pylingual.io, spanning 181,646 PYC binaries, 9,003 user-submitted patches, and 393 accuracy-verified patches. We investigate how reverse engineers respond to inaccurate decompilation and identify factors influencing their efforts to achieve accurate decompilation. We complement this unprecedented observational data with a controlled user study that isolates the technical difficulty of patching imperfect Python decompilations.By contrasting real-world patching behavior with that of the controlled setting, we discover that reversers' decision to repair a decompilation result is more strongly driven by the semantic content of the program (e.g., malware binaries or malicious tools) than by the technical difficulty of the patch. That is, a reverser's motivation is more important than their expertise.Our study reveals common patterns observed in the patching process, including how users approached the patching task, the types of errors they encountered, and the strategies they employed to resolve them. We also examine the strengths and limitations of assistive tools in the pursuit of perfect decompilation. Our findings offer unique insights into the practical dynamics of human-decompiler interaction, providing actionable recommendations for integrating human intelligence into the decompilation workflow and demonstrating the research potential of reliable decompilation accuracy verification.},

  abstract = {Recovering function signatures is a cornerstone of binary program analysis, yet it remains a challenging task. Existing methods either rely on disassembly-based constraints, which struggle with cross-architecture compatibility and scalability, or adopt learning-based approaches that are resource-intensive and often inaccurate. In this paper, we present CDA, a novel decompilation-based method for recovering function signatures that combines the strengths of multiple decompilers while mitigating their limitations. The core idea behind CDA is leveraging probabilistic constraints to estimate the likelihood of each function signature recovery result produced by decompilers, guided by inference rules specifically designed to address the limitations of decompilers. Based on these probabilities, CDA selects the recovery results with the highest likelihood as the final outcomes. We extensively evaluate CDA across five tasks --- variadic function/position detection, parameter identification, return value detection, and parameter type recovery --- comparing it against state-of-the-art tools, including IDA, Ghidra, Binary Ninja, and TYGR. Experimental results show that CDA outperforms baseline tools across multiple architectures (x64, x86, AArch64, Arm, and Mips) and optimization levels (O0-O3), highlighting its robustness and reliability in diverse compilation environments.},

  abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are proprietary assets due to the expertise, confidential data, and high development costs involved in model training. Well-trained DNN models are compiled into DNN binaries to be efficiently executed on various platforms, such as edge devices and cloud infrastructures. Recent research on DNN binary decompilation shows the potential of stealing DNN models via binary reverse engineering techniques. While obfuscation is a well-studied technique to hamper binary reverse engineering, general obfuscation schemes are not designed for this new type of binary and have limitations in concealing information within DNN binaries due to the unique characteristics of DNN binaries. In this paper, we show that existing reverse engineering attacks on DNN binaries can recover 98.5% of DNN operators from DNN binaries that have been obfuscated using general obfuscators. We then propose new obfuscation schemes tailored for DNN binaries, namely, (1) Flexible Operator Fusion; (2) Fake Operator Insertion; and (3) Operator Computation Reordering. We implement our dedicated obfuscation schemes as an end-to-end obfuscation toolchain called NeuroShield. Experiments show that NeuroShield is resilient to existing model reverse engineering attacks while introducing a reasonable overhead. Specifically, NeuroShield reduces the operator recovery rate to 3.03% for CV models and 47.18% for NLP models. Moreover, it has comparable binary size overhead and significantly lower execution time overhead (7.8% - 36.1%) compared to OLLVM, one of the commonly used general obfuscators.},

  abstract = {Binary lifting is a key component in binary analysis tools.        In order to guarantee the correctness of binary lifting,        researchers have proposed various formally verified lifters.        However, such formally verified lifters have too strict requirements on binary,        which do not sufficiently reflect real-world lifters. In addition, real-world lifters use heuristic-based assumptions to lift binary code, which makes it difficult to guarantee the correctness of the lifted code using formal methods. In this paper, we propose a new interpretation of the correctness of real-world binary lifting.        We formalize the process of binary lifting with heuristic-based assumptions used in real-world lifters by dividing it into a series of transformations, where each transformation represents a lift with new abstraction features.        We define the correctness of each transformation as filtered-simulation, which is a variant of bi-simulation, between programs before and after transformation.        We present three essential transformations in binary lifting and formalize them: (1) control flow graph reconstruction, (2) abstract stack reconstruction, and (3) function input/output identification.        We implement our approach for x86-64 Linux binaries, named FIBLE, and demonstrate that it can correctly lift Coreutils and CGC datasets compiled with GCC.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Batteryless Things revolutionizes sustainable communication as it operates on harvested energy. This harvested energy is dependent on unpredictable environmental conditions; therefore, device operations, including those of its networking stack, must be resilient to power failures. Reactive intermittent computing provides an approach for solving this by notifications of impending power failures, which is implemented by monitoring the harvested energy buffered in a capacitor. However, to use this power-failure notification and guarantee forward progress, systems must break down tasks into atomic transactions that can be predictably finished before the energy runs out. Thus, static program-code analysis must determine the worst-case energy consumption (WCEC) of all transactions. In Wi-Fi--capable devices, drivers are often closed-source, which avoids the determination of WCEC bounds for transactions since static analysis requires all code along with its semantics.In this work, we integrate an energy-aware networking stack with reverse-engineered Wi-Fi drivers to enable full-stack WCEC analysis for physical transmission and reception of packets. Further, we extended a static worst-case analysis tool with a resource-consumption model of our Wi-Fi driver. Our evaluation with the RISC-V--based ESP32-C3 platform gives worst-case bounds with our static analysis approach for the transactions of the full communication stack, therefore showing that Wi-Fi--based reactive intermittent computing is feasible.},

This paper examines the emergence and rise of speculative game design communities on itch.io—sites of ongoing creative resistance to corporate encroachment and exclusionary game culture. Specifically, the study documents the activities of “anti-game” jammers and fantasy console development communities on itch.io—two groups that create speculative games (that is, projects that are conceptual, arbitrary, and materially or procedurally unrealizable) to make space for personal play that is divested from mainstream engines, markets, and pretenses of game commodity: 1) Firstly, “anti-game” designers use game jams, zines, and Discord servers to develop and circulate not-games, games that refuse play, and games that cannot be played. These makers create provocative thought experiments, poems, manifestos, and other “unplayable” works that resist hyper-capitalist investment in bigger, longer, more graphically precise, live-service, metaversal, forever-games. 2) Simultaneously, developers on itch build projects for fantasy consoles—such as PICO-8 and Bitsy—and imagine hardware that is mutually-constituted, rooted in community, and decommodified. Ultimately, this paper argues that speculative design practices divest from concerns of “playability,” center unencumbered participation, and allow developers to envision and participate in a post-capitalist imaginary of hardware, software, and play.},

Detecting zero-day malware has become a primary focus for security researchers. Given that Google’s Android is one of the most widely used mobile operating systems, attackers have shifted their attention to creating malware specifically targeting Android. Numerous security researchers have employed various machine learning algorithms to detect these new Android and other types of malware. In this paper, we propose a system which employs a hybrid approach of analysis to better detect malware.The proposed model relies on a two-way approach in order to detect malwares in android application. This two-way approach first involves running the target APK through a static analytical model, If the result from the first stage comes out to be malicious, then the APK does not go to the second stage for further analysis. But, if the result from the first stage comes out to be benign, it is sent for further analysis by involving hybrid analysis (static + dynamic approach). The results given by the second stage will be ultimately determining whether the APK given is malicious or benign. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Hurry-sh/CCNCS-Project},

Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.},

Major new decompilers appear nearly every year and attain popularity, for a multitude of reverse-engineering or tool-building purposes. Technically, the problem is fundamental: it consists of recovering high-level control flow from a highly-optimized continuation-passing-style (CPS) representation. Architecturally, decompilers can be built using either static analysis or symbolic execution techniques. We present Shrnkr, a static-analysis-based decompiler succeeding the state-of-the-art Elipmoc decompiler. Shrnkr manages to achieve drastic improvements relative to the state of the art, in all significant dimensions: scalability, completeness, precision. Chief among the techniques employed is a new variant of static analysis context: shrinking context sensitivity. Shrinking context sensitivity performs deep cuts in the static analysis context, eagerly “forgetting” control-flow history, in order to leave room for further precise reasoning. We compare Shrnkr to state-of-the-art decompilers, both static-analysis- and symbolic-execution-based. In a standard benchmark set, Shrnkr scales to over 99.5% of contracts (compared to ∼95% for Elipmoc), covers (i.e., reaches and manages to decompile) 67% more code than Heimdall-rs, and reduces key imprecision metrics by over 65%, compared again to Elipmoc.},

UEFI's advantageous role in system design provides it with comprehensive access to system resources, beyond those of the operating system kernel. Consequently, detecting and thoroughly characterizing memory corruption vulnerabilities in UEFI firmware is essential for preserving the integrity and security of computer systems. The techniques for finding UEFI firmware vulnerabilities nowadays mostly face two main difficulties: First of all, the special character of UEFI firmware makes direct dynamic examination inside the operating system especially difficult; Second, conventional fuzzing techniques lead to ineffective testing with their shallow knowledge of UEFI input structures. We propose a novel approach combining static analysis with fuzzing techniques to help to reduce these limits. Our approach starts with static reverse engineering to fully understand the structural characteristics of inputs throughout several UEFI interfaces, followed by cross-validation against open-source firmware implementations. We then use this structured knowledge to guide the seed file mutation technique, hence improving the accuracy and efficiency of fuzzing activities.},

TranspileJS leverages a multi-stage architecture that converts JS to TypeScript, which is compiled into Wasm using the AssemblyScript compiler. TranspileJS addresses the challenges posed by the fundamental differences between JS and Wasm, including dynamic typing, runtime behaviour mismatches, and standard library discrepancies, ensuring that the original behaviour of the code is preserved while maximising the amount of code transpiled. Our experiments show that TranspileJS successfully transpiles approximately one-third of the code in our dataset, with a performance impact of up to a 12.3% increase in execution time. The transpilation process inherently obfuscates code, creating effects similar to standard obfuscation techniques, and generates a stealthy and resilient output. Furthermore, combining transpilation with WebAssembly-specific obfuscation techniques opens new possibilities for code protection and resistance against reverse engineering.},

Our work introduces Alpakka, a source-to-source compiler for Android's Smali syntax. To showcase Alpakka's capabilities, we developed an Alpakka library capable of detecting and automatically correcting resource leaks in Android APK files. We demonstrate Alpakka's effectiveness through empirical testing on 124 APK files from 31 real-world Android apps in the DroidLeaks [12] dataset.

From these, we successfully applied automatic corrections to 45 of the detected resource leaks.},

  abstract = {Recovering semantic information from binary code is a fundamental challenge in reverse engineering, especially when source-level information is unavailable. We aim to analyze the types and roles of structural elements from the binary observed in the compiled program, focusing on their contextual usage patterns and associations to other members.We refer to such semantic aspects as structural semantics , meaning that cooccurring patterns of jointly updated structure members reveal the functional roles that can be inferred from their coupling, throughout this paper. Recent approaches have applied graph neural networks (GNNs) to data-flow graphs (DFGs) for variable type inference, but most rely on a single model architecture, such as the relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN). While effective, such models may overlook alternative patterns of structure member behavior. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of three alternative GNN architectures gated graph neural networks (GGNN), graph attention networks (GAT), and standard graph convolutional networks (GCN) in capturing structural semantics from binary-level data-flow graphs. We evaluate these models on real-world binaries compiled at multiple optimization levels, measuring their ability to infer semantic properties of structure members. Our results show that these architectures capture complementary aspects of structural semantics. GGNN is effective at modeling long-range dependencies, GAT suppresses irrelevant connections, and GCN offers computational simplicity. Different model architectures emphasize distinct aspects of structural semantics, capturing complementary patterns of how structure members are accessed together in memory. This demonstrates that architectural diversity provides richer perspectives for semantic inference in binary analysis.},

Decompilers–tools that perform this translation–are essential for reverse engineers and security professionals, supporting critical tasks within their workflows. However, due to the inherent loss of information during compilation as a result of optimizations, inlining, and other compiler-specific transformations, decompiled output is often incomplete or inaccurate.A central challenge in decompilation is accurate type inference: the reconstruction of high-level type information for variables based on low-level code patterns and memory access behaviors. Despite ongoing advancements in decompilation research, there is a notable lack of comprehensive comparative studies evaluating the type inference capabilities of existing decompilers.This paper presents a benchmark study of five decompilers, focusing on their ability to infer types at both the function and variable levels. We conduct the evaluation on a dataset of binaries compiled from the Nixpkgs collection at both -O0 and -O2 optimization levels, allowing us to assess decompiler performance across unoptimized and optimized executables. The results highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of each decompiler and identify recurring scenarios in which incorrect type information is produced.},

  abstract = {In recent years, blockchain technology has developed rapidly and received widespread attention. However, its pseudonymous and decentralized nature has also attracted many criminal activities. Ponzi schemes, a kind of classic financial scam, also hide their true face in smart contracts, causing massive financial losses to blockchain users. Although several methods have been proposed to detect Ponzi contracts, there are still limitations in broad applicability, semantics understanding, and adversarial robustness. In this article, we propose PonziHunter, an intelligent framework for hunting Ponzi contracts on Ethereum. To tackle the problem of broad applicability, we train a detection model that does not require expert experience based on publicly available on-chain bytecode and off-chain contract labels. To tackle the problem of semantics understanding, we employ cross-function control flows and state variable dependencies to understand the logic of Ponzi contracts. Specifically, we decompile bytecodes into higher-order representations to analyze control flows and state variable dependencies and model the information as graph data. By combining the idea of code slicing, we identify the basic blocks related to Ponzi contract recognition. To tackle the problem of adversarial robustness, we model Ponzi contract recognition as a graph classification problem based on contrastive pre-training. We propose a data augmentation method for control flow graphs (CFGs), which preserves the basic blocks related to Ponzi contract recognition as much as possible during data perturbation. Experimental results show that PonziHunter outperforms state-of-the-art tools with average improvements of at least 4.77% on real-world ground-truth data and can newly discover 85 Ponzi contracts in the wild. More importantly, PonziHunter is robust against adversarial examples and can locate the critical basic blocks for smart Ponzi detection.},

  abstract = {Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) serves as a foundational technique for binary analysis tasks such as vulnerability detection and malware identification. Existing graph based BCSA approaches capture more binary code semantics and demonstrate remarkable performance. However, when code obfuscation is applied, the unstable control flow structure degrades their performance. To address this issue, we develop ORCAS, an Obfuscation-Resilient BCSA model based on Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG). The DESG is an original binary code representation, capturing more binaries' implicit semantics without control flow structure, including inter-instruction relations (e.g., def-use), inter-basic block relations (i.e., dominance and post-dominance), and instruction-basic block relations. ORCAS takes binary functions from different obfuscation options, optimization levels, and instruction set architectures as input and scores their semantic similarity more robustly. Extensive experiments have been conducted on ORCAS against eight baseline approaches over the BinKit dataset. For example, ORCAS achieves an average 12.1% PR-AUC improvement when using combined three obfuscation options compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, an original obfuscated real-world vulnerability dataset has been constructed and released to facilitate a more comprehensive research on obfuscated binary code analysis. ORCAS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches over this newly released real-world vulnerability dataset by up to a recall improvement of 43%.},

This process requires a deep understanding of the surrounding context, such as variable scope, object models, API calls, and database relations, to produce accurate results. These complex contextual dependencies make code completion a particularly challenging problem. Current models and approaches often fail to effectively incorporate such context, leading to inaccurate completions with low acceptance rates (around 30%). For tasks like data transfer, which rely heavily on specific relationships and data structures, acceptance rates drop even further. This study introduces CCCI, a novel method for generating context-aware code completions specifically designed to address data transfer tasks. By integrating contextual information, such as database table relationships, object models, and library details into Large Language Models (LLMs), CCCI improves the accuracy of code completions. We evaluate CCCI using 289 Java snippets, extracted from over 819 operational scripts in an industrial setting. The results demonstrate that CCCI achieved a 49.1% Build Pass rate and a 41.0% CodeBLEU score, comparable to state-of-the-art methods that often struggle with complex task completion.},

  abstract = {Ethereum smart contracts face serious security problems, which not only cause huge economic losses, but also destroy the Ethereum credit system. To solve this problem, code obfuscation techniques are applied to smart contracts to improve their complexity and security. However, the current source code obfuscation methods have insufficient anti-decompilation ability. Therefore, we propose a novel bytecode obfuscation approach called BOSC based on four kinds of bytecode obfuscation techniques, which is directed at solidity. The experimental results show that, after the bytecode obfuscation, the failure rate of decompilation tools is over 99% and only a small amount of gas is consumed.},

  abstract = {With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has been paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various educational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on blockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by developers for its “event-triggered” mechanism for building education intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified, so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly, the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG) are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the vulnerability detection of smart contracts. Compared with the traditional approaches, it can get good results with fewer layers of the GCN model, which shows that the contract bytecode and GCN model are efficient in vulnerability detection.},

Replacing these instructions with another more complex order or with different instructions with the same meaning without changing the result of the program will change the logic of the original instructions without affecting the result of the operation, which is the core principle of code obfuscation. In the compilation process, before the compiler compiles the code into the target machine code, it will transform the code into a kind of intermediate code, and then generate the target code after Control Flow Flattening and string encryption obfuscation of the intermediate code, which will make the decompilation work more difficult, thus realizing a code obfuscation system, and through some test cases, the effectiveness and feasibility of the system is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Binary reverse engineering is used to understand and analyse programs for which the source code is unavailable. Decompilers can help, transforming opaque binaries into a more readable source code-like representation. Still, reverse engineering is difficult and costly, involving considering effort in labelling code with helpful summaries. While the automated summarisation of decompiled code can help reverse engineers understand and analyse binaries, current work mainly focuses on summarising source code, and no suitable dataset exists for this task. In this work, we extend large pre-trained language models of source code to summarise de-compiled binary functions. Further-more, we investigate the impact of input and data properties on the performance of such models. Our approach consists of two main components; the data and the model. We first build CAPYBARA, a dataset of 214K decompiled function-documentation pairs across various compiler optimisations. We extend CAPYBARA further by removing identifiers, and deduplicating the data. Next, we fine-tune the CodeT5 base model with CAPYBARA to create BinT5. BinT5 achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU-4 score of 60.83, 58.82 and, 44.21 for summarising source, decompiled, and obfuscated decompiled code, respectively. This indicates that these models can be extended to decompiled binaries successfully. Finally, we found that the performance of BinT5 is not heavily dependent on the dataset size and compiler optimisation level. We recommend future research to further investigate transferring knowledge when working with less expressive input formats such as stripped binaries.},

  abstract = {Smart contract decompilers, converting smart contract bytecode into smart contract source code, have been used extensively in many scenarios such as binary code analysis, reverse engineering, and security studies. However, existing studies, as well as industrial engineering practices, all assumed that smart contract decompilers are reliable and trustworthy, to generate correct and semantically equivalent source code from binaries. Unfortunately, whether such an assumption truly holds in practice is still unknown.In this paper, we conduct, to the best of our knowledge, the first and most comprehensive large-scale empirical study of smart contract decompilers, to gain an understanding of the reliability, limitations, and remaining research challenges of state-of-the-art smart contract decompilation tools. We first designed and implemented a software prototype SOLINSIGHT, then used it to study 5 state-of-the-art smart contract decompilers. We obtained important findings and insights from empirical results, such as: 1) we proposed 3 root causes leading to decompiler failures; 2) we revealed 2 reasons hurting performance; 3) we identified 3 root causes affecting decompilation effectiveness; 4) we proposed a measurement metric for completeness; and 5) we investigated the resilience of contract decompilers against program transformations. We suggest that: 1) decompiler builders should enhance decompilers in terms of effectiveness, performance, and completeness; and 2) security researchers should select appropriate decompilers based on the suggestions in this study. We believe these findings and suggestions will help decompiler builders, contract developers, and security researchers, by providing better guidelines for contract decompiler studies.},

  abstract = {Obfuscation techniques are widely used to protect the digital copyright and intellectual property rights of software. Among them, code virtualization is one of the most powerful obfuscation techniques, which hides both the control flow and the data flow of the code, thereby preventing code from being decompiled. However, existing code virtualization solutions are not well-resistant to de-obfuscation techniques (e.g., symbolic execution and frequency analysis), and only target limited program languages and architectures, which are challenging to integrate into the process of software development and maintenance.In this paper, We propose an LLVM-based code virtualization tool, namely xVMP to fulfill a scalable and virtualized instruction-hardened obfuscation. To mask the effects of multiple program languages and architectures, xVMP incorporates the obfuscation process of code virtualization into the compilation, and generates virtualized code based on LLVM intermediate representation (IR). After virtualization, it embeds the interpreter of virtualized code into the IR and compiles to an executable. To enhance the security, xVMP encrypts virtualized instructions in each basic block and decrypts them at runtime to enhance the security of obfuscation. In addition, it supports specified function obfuscation. xVMP identifies the function annotations marked by the developer in the source code to locate the function to protect. We implement the prototype of xVMP, and evaluate it with a microbenchmark and three real-world programs. The experimental results show that xVMP can be more difficult to crack than the state-of-the-art obfuscators, and it can support more source code types and architectures, and can be applied to real-world software.

  abstract = {Extensible static checking tools, such as Sys and CodeQL, have successfully discovered bugs in source code. These tools allow analysts to write application-specific rules, referred to as queries. These queries can leverage the domain knowledge of analysts, thereby making the analysis more accurate and scalable. However, the majority of these tools are inapplicable to binary-only analysis. One exception, joern, translates a binary code into decompiled code and feeds the decompiled code into an ordinary C code analyzer. However, this approach is not sufficiently precise for symbolic analysis, as it overlooks the unique characteristics of decompiled code. While binary analysis platforms, such as angr, support symbolic analysis, analysts must understand their intermediate representations (IRs) although they are mostly working with decompiled code.In this paper, we propose a precise and scalable symbolic analysis called fearless symbolic analysis that uses intuitive queries for binary code and implement this in QueryX. To make the query intuitive, QueryX enables analysts to write queries on top of decompiled code instead of IRs. In particular, QueryX supports callbacks on decompiled code, using which analysts can control symbolic analysis to discover bugs in the code. For precise analysis, we lift decompiled code into our IR named DNR and perform symbolic analysis on DNR while considering the characteristics of the decompiled code. Notably, DNR is only used internally such that it allows analysts to write queries regardless of using DNR. For scalability, QueryX automatically reduces control-flow graphs using callbacks and ordering dependencies between callbacks that are specified in the queries. We applied QueryX to the Windows kernel, the Windows system service, and an automotive binary. As a result, we found 15 unique bugs including 10 CVEs and earned $180,000 from the Microsoft bug bounty program.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a crucial capability in forensic analysis, facilitating analysis of unknown binaries. The recent rise of Python malware has brought attention to Python decompilers that aim to obtain source code representation from a Python binary. However, Python decompilers fail to handle various binaries, limiting their capabilities in forensic analysis.This paper proposes a novel solution that transforms a decompilation error-inducing Python binary into a decompilable binary. Our key intuition is that we can resolve the decompilation errors by transforming error-inducing code blocks in the input binary into another form. The core of our approach is the concept of Forensically Equivalent Transformation (FET) which allows non-semantic preserving transformation in the context of forensic analysis. We carefully define the FETs to minimize their undesirable consequences while fixing various error-inducing instructions that are difficult to solve when preserving the exact semantics. We evaluate the prototype of our approach with 17,117 real-world Python malware samples causing decompilation errors in five popular decompilers. It successfully identifies and fixes 77,022 errors. Our approach also handles anti-analysis techniques, including opcode remapping, and helps migrate Python 3.9 binaries to 3.8 binaries.},

It is an essential optimization to simplify the design of x86 processors. However, introducing an additional layer of software beneath the instruction set poses security and reliability concerns. The microcode details are confidential to the manufacturers, preventing independent auditing or customization of the microcode. Moreover, microcode patches are signed and encrypted to prevent unauthorized patching and reverse engineering. However, recent research has recovered decrypted microcode and reverse-engineered read/write debug mechanisms on Intel Goldmont (Atom), making analysis and customization of microcode possible on a modern Intel microarchitecture. In this work, we present the first framework for static and dynamic analysis of Intel microcode. Building upon prior research, we reverse-engineer Goldmont microcode semantics and reconstruct the patching primitives for microcode customization. For static analysis, we implement a Ghidra processor module for decompilation and analysis of decrypted microcode. For dynamic analysis, we create a UEFI application that can trace and patch microcode to provide complete microcode control on Goldmont systems. Leveraging our framework, we reverse-engineer the confidential Intel microcode update algorithm and perform the first security analysis of its design and implementation. In three further case studies, we illustrate the potential security and performance benefits of microcode customization. We provide the first x86 Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) microcode implementation and its security evaluation, design and implement fast software breakpoints that are more than 1000x faster than standard breakpoints, and present constant-time microcode division, illustrating the potential security and performance benefits of microcode customization.},

  abstract = {Conducting binary function naming helps reverse engineers understand the internal workings of the code and perform malicious code analysis without accessing the source code. However, the loss of debugging information poses the challenge of insufficient high-level semantic information description for stripping binary code function naming. Meanwhile, the existing binary function naming scheme has one function label for only one sample. The long-tail effect of function labels for a single sample makes the machine learning-based prediction models face the challenge. To obtain a function correlation label and improve the propensity score of uncommon tail labels, we propose a multi-label learning-based binary function naming model BContext2Name. This model automatically generates relevant labels for binary function naming by function context information with the help of PfastreXML model. The experimental results show that BContext2Name can enrich function labels and alleviate the long-tail effect that exists for a single sample class. To obtain high-level semantics of binary functions, we align pseudocode and basic blocks based on disassembly and decompilation, identify concrete or abstract values of API parameters by variable tracking, and construct API-enhanced control flow graphs. Finally, a seq2seq neural network translation model with attention mechanism is constructed between function multi-label learning and enhanced control flow graphs. Experiments on the dataset reveal that the F1 values of the BContext2Name model improve by 3.55% and 15.23% over the state-of-the-art XFL and Nero, respectively. This indicates that function multi-label learning can provide accurate labels for binary functions and can help reverse analysts understand the inner working mechanism of binary code.

The compiled and decompiled bytecodes as Jimple representations were compared to analyze the unique differences in identifying code tempering. The results showed that the scope of the variable is important in whether the change was detected. Variables with a scope that was entirely contained within one method could have their names changed without triggering a warning, but global variables to objects could not. The parameter variable and the local variable behave differently. Since the parameter is in the publicly available part of the method Java treats it the same way as it does the global variable. The local variable is strictly private to the method and not made available to the outside. Such findings can support the analysis tool which is useful for identifying potential breaches to detect meaningful changes in code even if it is decompiled.},

Existing methods proposed for this issue are based on the low-level representation of binary code (e.g., assembly code), and especially the recent approaches employed neural-based models on instruction sequences. However, their performance is still unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, modern decompilers provide lifted representations of binary code, and their effectiveness has not been adequately studied. This paper further explores the issue of function name reassignment from the perspective of binary code representation. Specifically, we present a general and flexible NEural-based function name Reassignment framework NER, which leverages a decompiler to obtain a specific representation and applies the corresponding serialization strategy on it. NER then uses an alternative neural network to make predictions. Three levels of representation are investigated, including assembly code, Intermediate Representation (IR), and pseudo-code. We observe the binary code representations are significant for the final performance. It demonstrates that the pseudo-code is the most effective one. Based on these findings, we leverage the framework to implement a reassignment model NER-pc, which has 25% and 10% F1 score improvements against the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, more experiments are conducted to verify the design of NER and the effectiveness of NER-pc.},

The binary vulnerability similarity detection method based on machine learning lacks a fine-grained vulnerability similarity feature filtering mechanism, and cannot solve cross-function vulnerabilities triggered by data dependencies, resulting in a high vulnerability false positive rate in existing solutions, which limits practical applications. Software code vulnerabilities are usually caused by function key statements. Therefore, based on binary function decompilation, we identify the key statement that causes the vulnerability, analyze the cross-function data dependency of the key statements, extract the code similarity features and code vulnerability features of the key statements, and propose a feature filtering-based Binary vulnerability detection method SimFilter. SimFilter calculates the similarity of key statements by comparing the characteristics of function key statements, and infers the similarity of binary function vulnerabilities based on the similarity of key statements. The experimental results show that the vulnerability semantic features extracted by SimFilter are highly interpretable, and the accuracy rate is increased by 10.8% compared with other models. At the same time, we analyzed and evaluated the impact of different similarity features on the accuracy of SimFilter, and gave the best empirical value of the SimFilter model in firmware vulnerability detection.},

Specifically we present the model by integrating the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for decentralized files storage and Python as the interpreted programming language. IPFS ensures that contract code does not change by using content/hash-based addressing. The address of the file can be passed between nodes to recreate the files locally as long as nodes are running an IPFS node as well. In this implementation, we design the model to work with an existing prototype blockchain which was built with IPFS integration. The use of Python to write the code helps ensure transparency as the code does not need to be compiled and thus would not need to be run through a decompiler to make deployed code human-readable. We describe how the data is extracted and validated from a transaction before the code is executed locally and it's respective state updated and stored on the blockchain.},

  abstract = {Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in industrial control systems (ICS) run a control logic program to monitor and control critical infrastructures in real-time, such as nuclear plants and power grids. Attackers target PLC control logic remotely to sabotage or disrupt physical processes. Network intrusion detection systems (IDS) are increasingly used to detect malicious control logic. This paper demonstrates that standard IDS features in a protocol message header and payload are not resilient for detecting (control logic) binary programs, such as entropy, n-gram, and decompilation. It identifies and utilizes a PLC design feature, redundant address pins (RAP), unexplored in the literature, to bypass IDS for injecting a small piece of programmable malicious code (PMC) into a PLC's control logic as an initial attack vector, allowing it to execute with every scan cycle. We propose three unique attack methods (GizmoSplit, BuffWarp, and EnigmaFlow) using PMC as a proof of concept that blends control logic with network traffic via payload encoding, small-size payloads, or sparse memory addressing. The GizmoSplit attack divides the control logic into small gadgets and writes them in random memory locations in a PLC; PMC modifies the stack with the location of the gadgets to execute them as return-oriented programming. The BuffWarp attack employs a small-size buffer where the attacker writes malicious code periodically to bypass stateful inspection at the payload level; PMC, in turn, keeps moving the buffer content to consecutive memory locations to execute. The EnigmaFlow attack encodes control logic and sends it to a PLC's typically unused memory region, which PMC decodes and executes. The evaluation results indicate that these attacks are stealthy and can subvert IDS utilizing standard message header and payload features. This work points to a research gap in intrusion detection that caters to control logic attacks exploiting PLC design features.},

Identifying inline functions in the binary code is additionally challenging as there is no clear boundary between an inlined function and its caller function, the instructions of the same function might differ during inline expansion, and existing graph-schema methods for inline function identification cannot handle the vast number of functions involved due to their complexity. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose an effective inline function identification solution named ReIFunc, which combines subgraph isomorphism and deep learning to identify these recurring inline functions (RIFs). Our evaluation shows that ReIFunc can effectively match functions within a broad candidate set with a high precision rate exceeding 99% while maintaining an acceptable recall, thus getting rid of the constraints imposed by the limited size of the candidate set.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel Android application reinforcement method designed for 5G smartphones, addressing the security vulnerabilities inherent in Android's open-source na-ture. The method involves extracting key functions from Android applications, decompiling them into Smali code, and then trans-forming them into C++ code. This code is virtualized at compile time and repackaged into a new APK file, offering a more efficient reinforcement approach compared to traditional methods. It uses less computational power and storage while meeting the high safety standards of 5G technology. This approach is particularly effective against automated, low-threshold reverse engineering tools, which have challenged previous hardening methods. In our experiments, we analyzed six common Android shell tools on enhanced applications, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of these tools against our method. Our reinforcement overcomes the easy recovery issue of traditional methods and shows strong resistance to general reverse-engineering tools. We evaluated the performance pre- and post-hardening in terms of CPU utilization, size, and runtime memory usage. For instance, CPU utilization post-hardening increased by 0.9% for Gaud Map, 4.8% for WPS, and 1.3 % for public comments. The use of native Layer code and function localization enhances program efficiency, offsetting the performance overhead of fusion, thus maintaining overall performance stability. Our method's robustness against common reverse-engineering tools, with minimal impact on CPU usage, application size, and memory usage, confirms its practicality for deployment in the 5G ecosystem.},

Even though there exist methods that try to match source code with binary code to accelerate the reverse engineering process, most of them are designed to focus on one programming language. However, in real life, programs are developed using different programming languages depending on their requirements. Thus, cross-language binary-to-source code matching has recently gained more attention. Nonetheless, the existing approaches still struggle to have precise predictions due to the inherent difficulties when the problem of matching binary code and source code needs to be addressed across programming languages. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-language binary source code matching. We propose GraphBinMatch, an approach based on a graph neural network that learns the similarity between binary and source codes. We evaluate GraphBinMatch on several tasks, such as cross-language binary-to-source code matching and cross-language source-to-source matching. We also evaluate the performance of our approach on single-language binary-to-source code matching. Experimental results show that GraphBinMatch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art, with improvements as high as 15% over the F1 score.},

The application protection method can identify the installation files from unknown sources and prevent the installation.

Decompilation is crucial to transforming an application from machine code to something that can be read and understood by humans. For many programming languages, full decompilation is impossible. These languages build code directly to machine code, and some information, such as variable names, is lost in the process. JIT compilation also makes reverse engineering these applications much easier. Unlike true machine code programs, JIT&#x2010;compiled programs can often be converted to source code. All high&#x2010;level languages are eventually converted into a series of bits called machine code. Assembly code is designed to be a human&#x2010;readable version of machine code. A microarchitecture describes how a particular ISA is implemented on a processor. Reduced instruction set computing architectures define a small number of simpler instructions.</p>},

The idea of intermediate representations is to translate all assembly code for all architectures to the same language.

Automatic structure recovery involves automatically finding patterns and links in memory to make inferences about the data types used.

However, existing cloud application security solutions have failed to address the problem of runtime binary code security, focusing only on vulnerabilities inherent to the applications themselves. Code virtualization, also known as virtualization obfuscation, is a technique that protects software from malicious analysis by obfuscating the code. It hides the code’s control flow and data flow, thereby preventing the code from being decompiled. In this paper, we introduce a code virtualization method, VMENP, which splits the code into multiple modules and uses polymorphic and modular encryption mechanisms to secure binary code at runtime. Specifically, VMENP divides the protected program into several modules, designs a virtual instruction set along with its corresponding interpreter, encrypts each instruction individually after converting it into intermediate representations, and then encrypts it again at the basic block level. After compiling the segmented code into polymorphic bytecode sequences, it embeds the virtual code’s interpreter into the IR. During runtime, the protected code is dynamically decrypted and executed by the basic block level, with each basic block’s storage and execution in memory in a short time window. VMENP identifies functions annotated in the source code to locate the functions that need protection. This paper uses a large amount of $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{C}++$ code to perform tests in a real cloud environment. Experimental results show that VMENP achieves a good balance between the granularity of protection and the performance overhead of the protected programs, while successfully protecting $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{C}++$ code and programs running on X86/64 and ARM32/64 architectures.},

Most existing software diversification methods require access to the source code, which can provide defenders with more valuable information for devising effective defense strategies. However, due to commercial copyright and the purpose of preventing software piracy, developers often keep their software closed-source, making it difficult to access the source code. Therefore, a method called R2BF (ReCooking and Randomizing Binary File) is proposed, which combines decompilation and diversification compilation techniques to address the difficulty of obtaining the source code. This method involves diversifying the source code through compilation to achieve software diversification for binary executable files. Security and performance testing of diversified C programs has shown that diversified binary executable files can mitigate vulnerabilities resulting from code reuse, validating that this method can enhance the security of binary programs and is feasible for software protection. The diversified binary executable files are nearly identical to the original, non-diversified files in terms of file size and execution time, and may even exhibit acceleration and optimization effects in certain scenarios.},

The IRENE compiler replaces the original binary region with recompiled assembly, representing the user’s patch. IRENE allows developers to compose patches by modifying a high-level representation of the target program, but produces targeted micropatches. We evaluate the size of IRENE produced micropatches against patches produced both by recompilation and manual assembly patching in a case study.

Recovering decompiled code with high readability is essential, as humans must understand the code's functionality correctly. However, some compilation optimization strategies will introduce obfuscation into the binary code, thereby reducing the readability of decompiled code. Among them, the function inlining related optimization strategies combine functions, causing the original function's code volume and complexity to multiply. Especially with self-recursive inlining optimization, it transforms initially simple functions into ones with significantly increased code volume and complex logic, greatly hindering the understanding of security engineers. In this paper, we present Erase, the first approach to reverse the self-recursive inlining optimization technique. We compare Erase with state-of-the-art decompilers Ghidra and Hex-Rays to evaluate ERASE's improvement for the functions affected by self-recursive inlining. Experimental results show that Erase's output is 78.4% and 88.9% more compact (fewer lines of code) than Ghidra and Hex-Rays, respectively. Moreover, reverse engineers spend 88.5% less time analyzing ERASE's output than analyzing Ghidra and 90.4% less time than analyzing Hex-Rays, and the accuracy of analyzing Erase's output is 2.75 times higher than both Ghidra and Hex-Rays.},

Many detection methods have been proposed to detect the malware, mainly using machine learning, but they are not designed to work on IoT devices and are often implemented using Python. Running a Python program requires the installation of a package, which is impractical given the memory and storage size of IoT devices. In addition, methods that require decompilation, static and dynamic analysis of test samples are difficult to run on IoT devices. Therefore, in this research, we propose a method implemented in C/C++ so that malware detection using byte n-grams and machine learning can be run on IoT devices, and then resource consumption can be measured. Byte n-gram methods are good approaches to detect malware without knowing the execution environment. Moreover, the Top-L approach to information gain can be effectively applied to reduce storage and memory consumption. As a result of the evaluation, when using an SVM model with Top-50000 that maintains effective classification accuracy, the memory consumption was 71.91MB and the storage consumption was 1.3GB, which can be implemented in IoT devices.},

Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel and efficient malware detection techniques to improve accuracy and robustness.This study first employs the minhash algorithm to convert binary files of malware into grayscale images, followed by the extraction of global and local texture features using GIST and LBP algorithms. Additionally, the study utilizes IDA Pro to decompile and extract opcode sequences, applying N-gram and tf-idf algorithms for feature vectorization. The fusion of these features enables the model to comprehensively capture the behavioral characteristics of malware.In terms of model construction, a CNN-BiLSTM fusion model is designed to simultaneously process image features and opcode sequences, enhancing classification performance. Experimental validation on multiple public datasets demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional detection techniques in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, particularly in detecting variants and obfuscated malware with greater stability.The research presented in this paper offers new insights into the development of malware detection technologies, validating the effectiveness of feature and model fusion, and holds promising application prospects.},

In order to identify counterfeit APP more quickly and effectively, this paper proposes a counterfeit APP recognition model based on twin network. The model first decompiles and extracts the name, package name, icon, and signature information of the APP, then filters out suspected counterfeit applications by calculating the editing distance of the name, and finally calculates the icon similarity based on the twin network model to determine whether the application is counterfeit. In this paper, datasets containing multiple types of phishing applications are used for experiments, and the effects of VGG16, ResNet50, and ViT algorithms on the recognition results are compared as the basic feature extraction networks. The results show that the accuracy of the ViT-based twin network architecture reaches 85.12%, which can effectively identify counterfeit applications.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is the main process of software development, which is very important when a program tries to retrieve lost source codes. Although decompiling Java bytecode is easier than bytecode, many Java decompilers cannot recover originally lost sources, especially the selection statement, i.e., if statement. This deficiency affects directly decompilation performance. In this paper, we propose the methodology for guiding Java decompiler to deal with the aforementioned problem. In the framework, Java bytecode is transformed into two kinds of features called frame feature and latent semantic feature. The former is extracted directly from the bytecode. The latter is achieved by two-step transforming the Java bytecode to bigram and then term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF). After that, both of them are fed to the genetic algorithm to reduce their dimensions. The proposed feature is achieved by converting the selected TFIDF to a latent semantic feature and concatenating it with the selected frame feature. Finally, KNN is used to classify the proposed feature. The experimental results show that the decompilation accuracy is 93.68 percent, which is obviously better than Java Decompiler.},

An analysis of existing decompilers is conducted, with examples of programming language constructs that lead to decompilation errors or incorrect decompilation results. The principle of the methodology is demonstrated, and experiments are conducted to confirm that after embedding the digital watermark using the developed approach, it remains resilient to decompilation attacks aimed at its removal. The compiled class file containing the modified bytecode is analyzed. It is proven that the logic of the Java application remains unchanged after editing the bytecode of the class file and recompiling it. Certain constructs and code design patterns are examined, demonstrating that specific constructs in the source code increases the likelihood of incorrect decompilation of Java application class files, the inability to recompile the decompiled code.},

  abstract = {Static binary analysis is a widely used approach for ensuring the security of closed-source software. However, the absence of type information in stripped binaries, particularly for composite data types, poses significant challenges for both static analyzers and reverse engineering experts in achieving efficient and accurate analysis. Existing methods often struggle with inaccuracies and scalability limitations when dealing with such data types. To address these problems, we present Typeforge, a novel approach inspired by the workflow of reverse engineering experts, which uses a two-stage synthesis-selection strategy to automate the recovery of composite data types from stripped binaries. We design a new graph structure, the Type Flow Graph (TFG) to represent type information within stripped binaries. In the first stage, TFG-based Type Synthesis focuses on efficiently and accurately building constraints and synthesizing possible composite type declarations from the stripped binaries. In the second stage, we propose an LLM-assisted double-elimination framework to select the best-fit type declaration from the candidates by assessing the readability of the decompiled code. Our comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrates that TYPEFORGE achieves F1 scores of 81.7% and 88.2% in Composite Data Type Identification and Layout Recovery, respectively, substantially outperforming existing methods. Additionally, TYPEFORGE achieves an F1 score of 72.1% in Relationship Recovery, a particularly challenging task for previous approaches. Furthermore, TYPEFORGE has significantly lower time overhead, requiring only about 3.8% of the time taken by OSPREY, the best-performing existing approach, making it a promising solution for various real-world reverse engineering tasks.},

Most malicious applications masquerade as normal apps to steal private information from users. Conventional security approaches, both static analysis and dynamic analysis, have natural limitations when utilized individually. For the purpose of enhancing mobile security, this work suggests a Comprehensive Mobile Application Security Analysis Framework which combines static analysis, dynamic analysis, malware analysis, and reverse engineering techniques in the interest of identifying security defects in Android applications.The framework employs MoBSF for static analysis, Frida for dynamic instrumentation, VirusTotal for malware detection, and Apktool and Quark for reverse engineering. Apktool enables low-level decompilation of smali code, while Quark focuses on malware behavior detection through API call analysis. All these tools facilitate a comprehensive analysis of APK vulnerabilities, runtime threats, and malicious payloads.In this research paper, we explore various methodologies to analyze and improve mobile application security accuracy through static analysis, dynamic analysis, malware detection, and reverse engineering.This study shows how an integrated approach combining all four techniques improves detection accuracy, reducing false positives and uncovering hidden security threats. Results show that the hybrid approach effectively detects both known and unknown malware, making it an efficient approach for mobile application security assessments.

  abstract = {Reverse engineering is a crucial technique in software security, enabling professionals to analyze malware, identify vulnerabilities, and patch legacy software without access to source code. Although decompilers attempt to reconstruct high-level code from binaries, essential information, such as variable names and types, is often dissimilar from the original version, hindering readability and comprehension.Recent advancements have employed AI to enhance decompiler output by recovering original variable names and types. Traditional evaluation of recovery techniques relies on measuring similarity between original and recovered names, assuming that higher similarity enhances readability. However, studies suggest that these "intrinsic" metrics may not accurately predict "extrinsic" outcomes like user comprehension or task performance, revealing a gap in understanding readability and cognitive load in reverse engineering.This paper presents an extrinsic evaluation of machine-generated variable and type names, focusing on their impact on reverse engineers’ comprehension of decompiled code. We conducted a user study with 40 participants—including students and professionals—to assess code comprehension both with and without AI-generated variable and type name assistance. Our findings indicate a lack of correlation between traditional machine learning metrics and actual comprehension gains, highlighting limitations in current evaluation techniques. Despite this, participants showed a preference for AI-augmented decompiler outputs. These insights contribute to understanding the effectiveness of automatic recovery techniques in enhancing reverse engineering tasks and underscore the need for comprehensive, user-centered evaluation frameworks.},

  abstract = {Since the introduction of deep learning-based binary code similarity detection methods, there has been a proliferation of methods using graph neural networks to learn semantic information from intermediate representations such as control flow graphs. Graph Attention Network (GAT) is a graph neural network model based on the attention mechanism, the core idea of which is to dynamically aggregate information from adjacent nodes by adaptively learning the importance weights between nodes in the graph, which can enhance the training effect of the model by incorporating the attention mechanism. The structured representation advantage of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) is reflected in the hierarchical decomposition of program syntax structures, which effectively captures the logical semantics and contextual dependencies of the code, a feature that makes AST robust against the obfuscation of cross-architecture binary code. However, there has not yet been an approach that fuses graph attention networks and abstract syntax trees in the field of binary code similarity detection, so we propose a cross-architecture binary code similarity detection approach that fuses abstract syntax trees and graph attention networks. We use the open-source dataset provided by Asteria, decompile the binary code using the binary analysis tool IDA pro to extract the abstract syntax tree as the feature source of the neural network, and deeply optimize GAT for the limitations of processing tree data structure to improve its ability to learn the semantic information of AST. We trained TreeLSTM, plain GAT, and deeply optimized GAT neural network models respectively, and compared them. The experimental results show that the training speed of our proposed method is improved by 54.63% compared to the TreeLSTM-based method, and the AUC and Accuracy metrics are basically comparable.},

With the emergence of pattern-independent restructuring techniques, various attempts have been made to overcome readability limitations, especially concerning the use of gotos. However, despite these advances, recent approaches often fail to thoroughly address several inherent challenges of control-flow structuring, thereby affecting output quality or practicality.In this paper, we systematize the intrinsic challenges of control-flow structuring that every approach must address. In addition, we review existing methods, comparing them, while highlighting both their advantages and limitations with respect to these challenges. Specifically, we emphasize the practicability issues of current pattern-independent restructuring techniques and discuss whether and how future methods might overcome them. Finally, we explore the theoretical potential to mitigate some of these challenges by suggesting methodology ideas for various aspects of control-flow structuring.

  abstract = {Recovering high-level control-flow structures is a crucial part of modern reverse engineering, especially in fields like binary analysis. Here, analysts often use decompilers to convert functions of binary programs into a more humanreadable C -like representation. Among these control-flow structures, switch statements have unique significance because of their ability to represent complex decision-making and branching behavior in a concise and readable manner. Consequently, the successful recovery of switch statements during decompilation can greatly enhance the readability of the resulting output, making it a highly desired goal in the field of reverse engineering. In this paper, we present a new technique for identifying abstract syntax tree components that can be transformed into semantically equivalent switches, thus improving code readability. In contrast to other approaches, we do not rely on jump tables that have or have not been emitted during compilation. Instead, we identify clusters of comparisons involving the same expression but with varying constant values within the abstract syntax tree to be transformed into switch constructs. Because this approach is inherently linked to the semantic definition of a switch statements, it only generates meaningful switches by design. We evaluated our approach on the coreutils-9.3 dataset and compared it to the leading decompilers Ghidra and Hex-Rays, both of which attempt to recover switch statements as well. Our evaluation results indicate that our approach outperforms both Ghidra and Hex-Rays by successfully recovering more than twice as many switch constructs in the given dataset.},

Thus, security engineers require third-party tools to decompile and then visualize the contents of the profiles mentioned above. This paper presents a validation framework for iOS sandbox profile decompilers, specifically targeting the SandBlaster tool. Our approach represents sandbox profiles as dependency graphs and compares decompiled profiles with reference implementations compiled from Sandbox Profile Language (SBPL) representations using SandScout. We evaluated our framework in iOS versions 7–10, analyzing both individual profiles and bundled profile collections. The results demonstrate 100% precision and recall for iOS 7–8 profiles, 90-100% for iOS 9, and 75-100% for iOS 10. We also optimised a performance bottleneck in SandBlaster's node matching algorithm, reducing decompilation time from over 7 hours to under 5 minutes.},

  abstract = {Malware Detection is a nuanced activity that often requires human intervention and complex sandboxing methodology to detect complex and obfuscated malware. Human intervention is not practical for a large sample size of untested applications. Android, being the most used and heavily built-upon mobile operating system, is no stranger to having malware embedded in its packaged applications. This paper proposes an innovative ensemble deep learning model designed to classify Android applications as benign or malicious, known as AMADel. AMADeL includes three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) models ensembled together, which were trained on images generated using DEX bytecode obtained by decompiling APKs using Androguard. The APK files were sourced from the AndroZoo dataset. The dataset was prepared and used to train various models. The standalone CNNs gave the highest accuracy of 86.14%. Pre-trained models, such as ResNet50 and VGG16, achieved accuracies of 81.19% and 82.18%, respectively. However, the proposed AMADel attained an accuracy of over 90%.},

  abstract = {Android malware propagation poses increasing security risks to mobile ecosystems, with conventional detection techniques fighting an uphill battle against advanced evasion strategies and polymorphic variants that take advantage of static analysis limitations. Existing approaches including signature-based detection and conventional machine learning techniques have moderate performance against advanced obfuscation techniques and cannot capture complex structural relationships inherent in malicious code execution behavior. These limitations necessitate advanced techniques capable of carrying out in-depth structural analysis and dynamic pattern detection for malware detection. This paper proposes a new hybrid deep learning technique that combines Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis with Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DeepGraphCNNs) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to overcome current limitations. Our technique meticulously reverse-engineers APK packages, decompiles Dalvik bytecode to extract CFG representations and utilizes sophisticated graph embedding methods (DeepWalk, Node2Vec, Word2Vec) in the feature transformation process. The experiment is conducted on 2,349 samples from CICMalAnal2017 and MalwareBazar. Our DeepWalk-DeepGraphCNNs and TCN model demonstrated superior performance with 95.10% accuracy and 93.67% AUC-ROC. Our experimental results ensure the success of the technique for addressing contemporary Android security issues.},

  abstract = {The rapid proliferation of Android applications has made mobile platforms a prime target for malware attacks. To address the growing concern of malicious apps, this study presents an AI-based malware classification approach using Vision Transformer (ViT) on bytecode images of Android applications. Traditional malware detection techniques, including signature-based and heuristic methods, often fail to detect novel and obfuscated malware due to limited generalization and static rule-based systems. These limitations have necessitated the need for more intelligent and adaptive solutions that can handle complex and evolving malware patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework: Real-Time Malware Detection in App Stores using Bytecode Image Generation and Vision Transformer-Based Classification (RAMViD). In this approach, Android APK files are first decompiled to extract Dalvik bytecode, which is then transformed into grayscale images representing the byte patterns of the application. These images are fed into a finetuned Vision Transformer model that learns intricate visual features of benign and malicious patterns for accurate classification. The proposed method can be integrated into app store infrastructures to perform real-time malware analysis during the app submission process. This ensures proactive filtering of malicious applications before they reach end-users, enhancing platform security without manual intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that the ViT-based classification framework outperforms conventional CNN-based models in accuracy and robustness. The system achieves high detection rates with reduced false positives, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying both known and previously unseen malware. This solution offers a scalable, automated, and intelligent alternative for securing Android ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Android app security is a critical concern for the software industry, with companies investing significantly in protecting their intellectual property from reverse engineering attacks. While commercial protection tools exist to prevent decompilation and unauthorized code access, they pose substantial challenges for businesses: high licensing costs ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars annually, significant performance overhead that impacts user experience and app ratings, and increased app size that affects download rates. These limitations particularly burden small to medium-sized enterprises and independent developers, creating an urgent industry need for cost-effective protection solutions.To address these challenges, we propose a novel file format-based anti-decompilation strategy that systematically exploits structural vulnerabilities in APK files. Building upon this strategy, we have developed APKARMOR, a lightweight and cost-effective anti-decompilation framework that exploits inherent vulnerabilities in popular reverse engineering tools. Through systematic analysis, we first identified critical weaknesses in common decompilation tools’ parsing mechanisms and structural assumptions. Based on these findings, we developed seven mutation-based protection strategies that deliberately trigger these vulnerabilities by introducing specific structural anomalies into APK files and the AndroidManifest.xml. These methods include Countermeasures against Dirty Code and Corrupted Payloads (CACoP), Pseudo-Encryption (PE), Using Unknown Compression Method (UUCM), Unavailable Magic Value (UMA), Modify the Offset Field in stringChunk (MOFS), and Dirty Bytecode Replacement of "Android" (DRA). We evaluated our exploitation strategies through extensive experiments on 100 randomly selected Android apps, testing against the latest versions of three widely used decompilation tools: JADX (v1.5.1), APKTool (v2.11.0), and Androguard (v4.1.2). Our results demonstrate that PE and DRA achieved complete protection by successfully exploiting vulnerabilities present in all tested tools. MOFS, UUCM, and UNV effectively exploited weaknesses in APKTool and Androguard’s parsing mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, PHP has consistently been one of the most popular server-side programming languages among developers for web development. To protect intellectual property, various PHP source code obfuscation and encryption methods have been developed, which has led to difficulties in performing security analysis on PHP source code. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of recovering source code by extracting bytecode from PHP during dynamic execution. However, there is still a lack of a universal decompilation method for this kind of bytecode, tailored to PHP’s unique syntax. Thus, we propose a systematic decompilation framework for PHP bytecode. First, we design a unified intermediate representation that eliminates the differences between bytecodes from different PHP versions. Then, we introduce a structural analysis algorithm specifically for PHP syntax, improving upon existing methods to better accommodate PHP’s unique syntax. We use over 3 million lines of PHP code as a dataset and compiled it into PHP bytecode. After decompiling it with our method, we successfully recovered 92% of the classes and 85% of the methods. Furthermore, from the encrypted dataset containing 37 SQL injection and 31 XSS vulnerability patterns, we fully restored the original vulnerability patterns and reconstructed the exploitation chains. Furthermore, we identified a series of vulnerabilities in real-world projects and were assigned 6 new CVE IDs1, demonstrating the correctness of our method and its ability to assist in static analysis for vulnerability discovery.1CVE-2025-45046, CVE-2025-45047, CVE-2025-45048, CVE-2025-45049, CVE-2025-45050, CVE-2025-45052},

  abstract = {We study effects of compilation and decompilation to code clone detection in Java. Compilation/decompilation canonicalise syntactic changes made to source code and can be used as source code normalisation. We used NiCad to detect clones before and after decompilation in three open source software systems, JUnit, JFreeChart, and Tomcat. We filtered and compared the clones in the original and decompiled clone set and found that 1,201 clone pairs (78.7%) are common between the two sets while 326 pairs (21.3%) are only in one of the sets. A manual investigation identified 325 out of the 326 pairs as true clones. The 252 original-only clone pairs contain a single false positive while the 74 decompiled-only clone pairs are all true positives. Many clones in the original source code that are detected only after decompilation are type-3 clones that are dicult to detect due to added or deleted statements, keywords, package names; flipped if-else statements; or changed loops. We suggest to use decompilation as normalisation to compliment clone detection. By combining clones found before and after decompilation, one can achieve higher recall without losing precision.},

Due to unknown build flags and compiler information, third party components usually cannot be reused. When it comes to the matter of software components developed in C language, the only place to look for this information is in compiled binary file. Since there are no standards for C language that bind compiler to leave any information about itself in binary file, the information is not expected to be found. However, the information can be found in most of the binary files. This paper investigates what is the possibility of retrieving the information about compiler name and version based on the content of the binary code, without decompiling the binary code. The information retrieving opens up new possibilities for reusing the components and verifying the software requirements as well.},

Identifying app installation packages from network traffic is one of the most feasible approaches to collect these data. But asymmetric routing, incomplete capture and so on make it challenging to determine app's name at large scale in network traffic. With these constraints, we proposed AppTwins, an efficient, robust and automatical approach which has the ability to determine corrupted package's name. The identification consists of three distinct steps. Step 1, identify app packages with a stream fuzzy hash fingerprint database in live network traffic. Step 2, the unprecedented ones were captured and decompiled to acquire new app's name, a fingerprint was also calculated. Step3, update the database with new app's name and fingerprint. AppTwins achieves up a recall rate of 97.63% and a precision rate of 96.44% when app packages are almost complete. Furthermore, It can also identify incomplete app packages in the real traffic where there are no name or URL.},

  abstract = {Android access control granularity based on its permission mechanism is relatively coarse, which cannot effectively protect the user privacy. Many Android applications do not strictly abide by the principle of least privilege (PLP). Both benign and malicious apps may request more permissions than those they really use. We rethink previous permission over-claim problem of Android applications, and extend it to three kinds of problems: Explicit Permission Over-claim, Implicit Permission Over-claim and Ad Library Permission Over-claim. The latter two problems are new that have not been raised by any previous work. Static analysis is to decompile the applications to generate intermediate code and then analyze the usage of permissions. Our static analysis on 10710 applications shows that 76.08% of them may have Explicit Permission Over-claim problem, among those there are 424 applications that have sensitive permissions, which are only used in the advertisement library's code of the applications rather than developer's own code. They have Ad Library Permission Over-claim problem. The main idea of our semantic analysis is to calculate the semantic similarity between apps' descriptions and function phrases. If the similarity exceeds a certain threshold, the app is considered relevant to the corresponding function. We compare the results of the semantic analysis with those of manual reading of 102 Android application descriptions. The F-measures of the three chosen functions are 80.82%, 70.48% and 89.62%, respectively. The evaluation results show our method can efficiently detect the above three kinds of permission over claim problems which indicates that our method would be helpful for normal users to have a clear understanding of permission usage of Android applications.},

  abstract = {With Android application packing technology evolving, there are more and more ways to harden APPs. Manually unpacking APPs becomes more difficult as the time needed for analyzing increase exponentially. At the beginning, the packing technology is designed to prevent APPs from being easily decompiled, tampered and re-packed. But unfortunately, many malicious APPs start to use packing service to protect themselves. At present, most of the antivirus software focus on APPs that are unpacked, which means if malicious APPs apply the packing service, they can easily escape from a lot of antivirus software. Therefore, we should not only emphasize the importance of packing, but also concentrate on the unpacking technology. Only by doing this can we protect the normal APPs, and not miss any harmful APPs at the same time. In this paper, we first systematically study a lot of DEX packing and unpacking technologies, then propose and develop a universal unpacking system, named CrackDex, which is capable of extracting the original DEX file from the packed APP. We propose three core technologies: simulation execution, DEX reassembling, and DEX restoration, to get the unpacked DEX file. CrackDex is a part of the Dalvik virtual machine, and it monitors the execution of functions to locate the unpacking point in the portable interpreter, then launches the simulation execution, collects the data of original DEX file through corresponding structure pointer, finally fulfills the unpacking process by reassembling the data collected. The results of our experiments show that CrackDex can be used to effectively unpack APPs that are packed by packing service in a universal approach without any other knowledge of packing service.},

The application wrapping (Appwrapping) technology is one way to be applied EMM solutions, by modifying binary applications without the original source code. In the past, Appwrapping was performed to control permissions or APIs to protect privacy on Android. This method is applied collectively to the whole section, not a specific section of the app, so it is difficult to control the section (flow) desired by the user or the manager. In addition, system overhead can occur because the control is applied to the whole section of the app. In this paper, we propose a method to insert an additional security policy code at a certain interval position in the intermediate code of a binary app, so that it can be controlled at a specific interval rather than the whole interval of the app. The proposed method extracts and saves the security policy intermediate code and the related file in advance and then adds the security policy code to the specific method on the intermediate code of the specific activity acquired by decompiling the target app. Finally, the additional security policy code is modified to avoid errors caused by the additional code. We create an automation tool for performance verification, experiment with five commercial office apps, and confirm that the apps work properly with the added EMM security functions.},

At the same time, security became a critical aspect, since private patient medical data are handled. In this field in which gather mobile technologies with medicine, security has great importance. Therefore, it is essential to conduct security audits to mobile applications which deal with private information and confidential patient data. The main objective of this paper is to carry out an audit of security of an mHealth Android application. Taking HeartKeeper application to self-manage cardiac patients, a series of tests and modifications are conducted to check its strengths and weaknesses. The methodology consists in attempting to decompile the application HeartKeeper. Applying to the source code techniques of reverse engineering, we will try to perform an analysis that allows us to carry out the security check of the Android application HeartKeeper. It can be applied to audit security on any other Android application. In this way, it provides developers a tool that allows them to check the security of any Android app. Among these vulnerabilities found, the most relevant is that which allows us to inject code to steal some private information. This information should only be accessible from the application itself and only once the user is authenticated. As solutions, we propose different protections. These are: protection against decompilation, against code analysis, and against modified applications. It is very important to carry out a comprehensive review of the mobile applications' strength, since they are increasingly present in our lives and they manage sensitive and protected data. It is highly recommended to install applications from trusty sources, as they are the official app stores like Google Play Store in Android and iOS App Store.},

It offers various features such as GPS tracking, Siri, multi touch gestures, biometric authentication etc. The functionality of an iOS device can be expanded by installing third party applications, available from App store. Apple follows a mandatory code signing process to ensure that applications are developed by trusted enterprises/developers and no malware exists on App Store. However, past attacks on iOS devices such as ikee, Wirelurker have revealed that Apple's code signing process is not sufficient to ensure the security of its devices. Considering past attacks on iOS devices and with view of analyzing the behavior of iOS applications, this paper aims to describe how an analyst can perform reverse engineering of iOS applications by disassembling, decompiling and debugging application's code using Disassembler to discover the vulnerable areas.},

  abstract = {Reverse engineering is the process of decompiling and disassembling the executables to recover the source code/assembly code embedded within it. While reverse engineering is the process of examining the code, in offensive context the attackers can re-engineer the code which leads to software piracy. Software anti-tamper technology like obfuscation is used to deter both reverse engineering and re-engineering of proprietary software and software-powered systems. Code obfuscation, as a part of software protection, got commercial interest from both vendors and as well as from the clients. Vendors want to keep their proprietary code as secret and customers needs software upon which they can trust. In this article, a code obfuscation technique has been proposed to complicate the process of reverse engineering. The basic idea is to conceal the proprietary code section by using preventive design obfuscation and insertion of self-modifying code at the binary level. The combination of design level obfuscation and the insertion of self-modifying code converts the code into a semantically equivalent one that makes it difficult to reverse engineer. The technique is evaluated using different sorting algorithms. The experimental results quantify the degree of obfuscation, stealth of the code, and effects on execution time and code size.},

Our solution, SmartInspect, also uses a mirror-based architecture to represent locally object responsible for the interpretation of the contract state. SmartInspect allows contract developers to better visualize and understand the contract stored state without needing to redeploy, nor develop any ad-hoc code.},

  abstract = {Configuring and maintaining a firewall configuration is notoriously hard. Policies are written in low-level, platform-specific languages where firewall rules are inspected and enforced along non trivial control flow paths. Further difficulties arise from Network Address Translation (NAT), since filters must be implemented with addresses translations in mind. In this work, we study the problem of decompiling a real firewall configuration into an abstract specification. This abstract version throws the low-level details away by exposing the meaning of the configuration, i.e., the allowed connections with possible address translations. The generated specification makes it easier for system administrators to check if: (i) the intended security policy is actually implemented; (ii) two configurations are equivalent; (iii) updates have the desired effect on the firewall behavior. The peculiarity of our approach is that is independent of the specific target firewall system and language. This independence is obtained through a generic intermediate language that provides the typical features of real configuration languages and that separates the specification of the rulesets, determining the destiny of packets, from the specification of the platform-dependent steps needed to elaborate packets. We present a tool that decompiles real firewall configurations from different systems into this intermediate language and uses the Z3 solver to synthesize the abstract specification that succinctly represents the firewall behavior and the NAT. Tests on real configurations show that the tool is effective: it synthesizes complex policies in a matter of minutes and, and it answers to specific queries in just a few seconds. The tool can also point out policy differences before and after configuration updates in a simple, tabular form.},

This paper proposes an android mobile malware detection system based on deep neural network, a novel malware detection method which uses optimized deep Convolutional Neural Network to learn from opcode sequences. In the proposed detection system, the optimized Convolutional Neural Network is trained multiple times by the raw operation code sequence extracted from the decompiled android file, so that the feature information can be effectively learned and the malicious program can be detected more accurately. More critically, the k-max pooling method with better results was adopted in the pooling operation phase, and which improves the detection effect of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the detection system achieved the accuracy of 99%, which is 2%-11 % higher than the accuracy of the machine learning detection algorithms when using the same dataset. It also ensures that the indicators such as Fl-score, Recall and Precision are maintained above 97%.},

Malimg dataset, a publicly available benchmark data set was used for the experimentation. The architecture used in this work is a hybrid cost-sensitive network of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which obtained an accuracy of 94.4%, an increase in performance compared to work done by [1] which got 84.9%. Hyper parameter tuning is done on deep learning architecture to set the parameters. A learning rate of 0.01 was taken for all experiments. Train-test split of 70-30% was done during experimentation. This facilitates to find how well the models perform on imbalanced data sets. Usual methods like disassembly, decompiling, de-obfuscation or execution of the binary need not be done in this proposed method.

  abstract = {During compilation from Java source code to bytecode, some information is irreversibly lost. In other words, compilation and decompilation of Java code is not symmetric. Consequently, the decompilation process, which aims at producing source code from bytecode, must establish some strategies to reconstruct the information that has been lost. Modern Java decompilers tend to use distinct strategies to achieve proper decompilation. In this work, we hypothesize that the diverse ways in which bytecode can be decompiled has a direct impact on the quality of the source code produced by decompilers. We study the effectiveness of eight Java decompilers with respect to three quality indicators: syntactic correctness, syntactic distortion and semantic equivalence modulo inputs. This study relies on a benchmark set of 14 real-world open-source software projects to be decompiled (2041 classes in total). Our results show that no single modern decompiler is able to correctly handle the variety of bytecode structures coming from real-world programs. Even the highest ranking decompiler in this study produces syntactically correct output for 84% of classes of our dataset and semantically equivalent code output for 78% of classes.},

Each graph is viewed probabilistically as a Markov chain where each node represents a code block of the corresponding function, and by computing the PageRank vector (Perron vector with transport), a probability measure can be defined over the nodes of the given graph. Each graph is vectorized by computing Lebesgue antiderivatives of hand-engineered functions defined on the vertex set of the given graph against the PageRank measure. Files are subsequently vectorized by aggregating the set of vectors corresponding to the set of graphs resulting from decompiling the given file. The result is a fast, intuitive, and easy-to-compute glass-box vectorization scheme, which can be leveraged for training a standalone classifier or to augment an existing feature space.

Our approach first uses a decompilation tool (remill) to extract low-level intermediate representation (LLVM) from the machine code. This step consists of instruction translation (i.e. recovery of operation semantics), control flow extraction and address identification.The main contribution of this paper is the second step, which builds on data flow analysis and refinement of indirect (i.e. data-dependent) control flow. This step makes the processed bitcode much more amenable to formal analysis.To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we have compiled a set of benchmark programs into native executables and analysed them using two LLVM-based tools: DIVINE, a software model checker and KLEE, a symbolic execution engine. We have compared the outcomes to direct analysis of the same programs.},

  abstract = {We propose an intelligent malware detection system (MOBDroid) that aims to protect the end-user's mobile device (MD) in mobile cloud computing (MCC) environment. MOBDroid utilizes the Android Operating System (OS) permission-based security system. The APK files of 28,306 benign and malicious applications (apps) collected from the AndroZoo and RmvDroid malware repositories were used in the system development process. The apps were decompiled in order to extract their manifest files and construct a dataset comprising the permissions requested by each of the apps. We identified some unique permissions that could be used to distinguish between malicious and benign apps and performed a series of experiments using a machine learning (ML) model; the model drew on the ML.net library and was implemented in C#.net. In the experiments conducted, we obtained classification accuracy of 96.89%, a detection rate of 98.65%, and false negative rate of 1.35%. The results indicate that our model compares very favorably to other models reported in the extant literature.},

  abstract = {Android is the major operating system for mobile devices. The presence of the Google Play Store creates an ecosystem between the app developers and users. As the ecosystem grows, some pirated apps start to show up. This is possible due to the nature of the Android Application that easily can be extracted and decompiled to reveal the source code and the assets file. This research proposed a methodology to protect the application assets from piracy using the cryptographic algorithm. The assets are encrypted during the compile-time using the Gradle build system provided by the Android Studio. While the decryption is performed in the Android device during the application run-time. The proposed algorithm is the pair of asymmetric algorithm called RSA and the symmetric algorithm called AES. This research shows that RSA-AES gives the best security in protecting the assets of Android applications. Besides, the performance of the algorithm is evaluated based on the speed of the encryption and decryption that reach 106.82 MB/s and 44.42 MB/s respectively.},

  abstract = {Decompilers are indispensable tools in Android malware analysis and app security auditing. Numerous academic works also employ an Android decompiler as the first step in a program analysis pipeline. In such settings, decompilation is frequently regarded as a "solved" problem, in that it is simply expected that source code can be accurately recovered from an app. While a large proportion of methods in an app can typically be decompiled successfully, it is common that at least some methods fail to decompile. In order to better understand the practical applicability of techniques in which decompilation is used as part of an automated analysis, it is important to know the actual expected failure rate of Android decompilation. To this end, we have performed what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale study of Android decompilation failure rates. We have used three sets of apps, consisting of, respectively, 3,018 open-source apps, 13,601 apps from a recent crawl of Google Play, and a collection of 24,553 malware samples. In addition to the state-of-the-art Dalvik bytecode decompiler jadx, we used three popular Java decompilers. While jadx achieves an impressively low failure rate of only 0.02% failed methods per app on average, we found that it manages to recover source code for all methods in only 21% of the Google Play apps.We have also sought to better understand the degree to which in-the-wild obfuscation techniques can prevent decompilation. Our empirical evaluation, complemented with an indepth manual analysis of a number of apps, indicate that code obfuscation is quite rarely encountered, even in malicious apps. Moreover, decompilation failures mostly appear to be caused by technical limitations in decompilers, rather than by deliberate attempts to thwart source-code recovery by obfuscation. This is an encouraging finding, as it indicates that near-perfect Android decompilation is, at least in theory, achievable, with implementation-level improvements to decompilation tools.},

Some researches have proved that IOT APP could be cracked down and source code (C/C++, JAVA, etc) is likely to be decompiled by attackers with expert skills. And this trend is going to be irreversible with a variety of auto-cracking tools published, which means that the cost of time and cracking technique are unprecedentedly decreased. To avoid source code leaking, some ways of protecting native code in ELF file such as code obfuscation or ELF shell (special in Android) were provided and then applied widely. But these schemes can not meanwhile completely satisfy the performance and secure rate in Linux platform. This paper originally proposes a scheme that protects native code from being decompiled and stolen in situation where ELF file is called by JAVA in Linux. The SM4 encryption algorithm and look-up table are creatively used to achieve the goals of apparently elevating the security within a limited performance price. At the posterior of the paper, a control experiment between one famous open source project and this scheme is introduced to supply the data supporting.},

  abstract = {Industrial control systems (ICSs) consist of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) which communicate with an engineering station on one side, and control a certain physical process on the other side. Siemens PLCs, particularly S7-300 controllers, are widely used in industrial systems, and modern critical infrastructures heavily rely on them. But unfortunately, security features are largely absent in such devices or ignored/disabled because security is often at odds with operations. As a consequence of the already reported vulnerabilities, it is possible to leverage PLCs and perhaps even the corporate IT network. In this paper we show that S7-300 PLCs are vulnerable and demonstrate that exploiting the execution process of the logic program running in a PLC is feasible. We discuss a replay attack that compromises the password protected PLCs, then we show how to retrieve the Bytecode from the target and decompile the Bytecode to STL source code. Afterwards we present how to conduct a typical injection attack showing that even a very tiny modification in the code is sufficient to harm the target system. Finally we combine the replay attack with the injection approach to achieve a stronger attack – the stealth program injection attack – which can hide the previous modification by engaging a fake PLC, impersonating the real infected device. For real scenarios, we implemented all our attacks on a real industrial setting using S7-300 PLC. We eventually suggest mitigation approaches to secure systems against such threats.},

  abstract = {On-device deep learning models have shown growing popularity in mobile apps, which allows offline model inference while preserving user privacy. However, on-device deep learning models also introduce security challenges, i.e., the trained models can be easily stolen or even be tampered by attackers. Recent studies suggested that most of the on-device models are lacking of sufficient protection, i.e., can be stolen by decompiling the apps directly. In this work, we present MMGUARD, an automated framework for building mutual authentication between Android apps and deep neural network models, which can thus protect on-device models from being easily attacked (piracy and tampering). Unlike existing model protect methods, our approach does not require model re-training or any prior knowledge of the training data. The key idea of MMGUARD is to verify the deep learning model in the app before inference, i.e., feeding owner- and apprelated information to it, which can greatly increase the effort of model hacking. We evaluate MMGUARD on 5 popular image classification DNNs and 43 real world Android apps from Google Play. Experiment results suggest that MMGUARD introduces negligible latency on models and can be automatically applied to real world apps.},

  abstract = {Recovering variables and data structure information from stripped binary is a prominent challenge in binary program analysis. While various state-of-the-art techniques are effective in specific settings, such effectiveness may not generalize. This is mainly because the problem is inherently uncertain due to the information loss in compilation. Most existing techniques are deterministic and lack a systematic way of handling such uncertainty. We propose a novel probabilistic technique for variable and structure recovery. Random variables are introduced to denote the likelihood of an abstract memory location having various types and structural properties such as being a field of some data structure. These random variables are connected through probabilistic constraints derived through program analysis. Solving these constraints produces the posterior probabilities of the random variables, which essentially denote the recovery results. Our experiments show that our technique substantially outperforms a number of state-of-the-art systems, including IDA, Ghidra, Angr, and Howard. Our case studies demonstrate the recovered information improves binary code hardening and binary decompilation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss an approach which allows an attacker to modify the control logic program that runs in S7 PLCs in its high-level decompiled format. Our full attack-chain compromises the security measures of PLCs, retrieves the machine bytecode of the target device, and employs a decompiler to convert the stolen compiled bytecode (low-level) to its decompiled version (high-level) e.g. Ladder Diagram LAD. As the LAD code exposes the structure and semantics of the control logic, our attack also manipulates the LAD code based on the attacker’s understanding to the physical process causing abnormal behaviors of the system that we target. Finally, it converts the infected LAD code to its executable version i.e. machine bytecode that can run on the PLC using a compiler before pushing the malicious code back to the PLC. For a real scenario, we implemented our full attack-chain on a small industrial setting using real S7-300 PLCs, and built the database (for our decompiler and compiler) using 108 different control logic programs of varying complexity, ranging from simple programs consisting of a few instructions to more complex ones including multi functions, sub-functions and data blocks. We tested and evaluated the accuracy of our decompiler and compiler on 5 random programs written for real industrial applications. Our experimental results showed that an external adversary is able to infect S7 PLCs successfully.

The exploration used the static analysis method, where the source code of the two applications were decompiled, compared, and analyzed. The de-compilation is done using the MobSF tool and the comparison using the extension of Visual Studio Code called Compare Folders. The differences in the source code found are then analyzed for possible behavior to determine whether it can cause harm, for example stealing user credentials. Although no malicious code was found on WhatsApp Plus, in our study, users must stay alert since they remain vigilant in installing and using WhatsApp Plus because the developer may add malicious code to the next version update.},

First, the binary sample of the malicious code of the APT attack are preprocessed with some operations such as decompression and decompilation. APT attack malicious code samples are running in a sandbox with anti-code escaping technology, and the acquired data are converted into grayscale images. Then, we perform feature extraction and family clustering operations on the pre-processed image. Finally, the DenseNet convolutional neural network model is trained and tested on the sample data of the APT attack malicious code of eight families. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed scheme for the detection of APT attack malicious code and its variants can reach 98.84%. While cutting off the APT attack chain, it has a high detection accuracy.},

The findings show that BINDEEP is more robust and achieves significant improvement over these existing systems when confronted with changes introduced by code transformation methods or the use of different compilers and optimization levels. Furthermore, BINDEEP is able to discover source packages in malware binaries, such as Zeus and Citadel, that match those listed in existing security reports.},

  abstract = {Binary lifters convert executables into an intermediate representation (IR) of a compiler framework. The recovered IR code is generally deemed “analysis friendly,” bridging low-level code analysis with well-established compiler infrastructures. With years of development, binary lifters are becoming increasingly popular for use in various security, systems, and software (re)-engineering applications. Recent studies have also reported highly promising results that suggest binary lifters can generate LLVM IR code with correct functionality, even for complex cases.This paper conducts an in-depth study of binary lifters from an orthogonal and highly demanding perspective. We demystify the “expressiveness” of binary lifters, and reveal how well the lifted LLVM IR code can support critical downstream applications in security analysis scenarios. To do so, we generate two pieces of LLVM IR code by compiling C/C++ programs or by lifting the corresponding executables. We then feed these two pieces of LLVM IR code to three keystone downstream applications (pointer analysis, discriminability analysis, and decompilation) and determine whether inconsistent analysis results are generated. We study four popular static and dynamic LLVM IR lifters that were developed by the industry or academia from a total of 252,063 executables generated by various compilers and optimizations and on different architectures. Our findings show that modern binary lifters afford IR code that is highly suitable for discriminability analysis and decompilation, and suggest that such binary lifters can be applied in common similarity- or code comprehension-based security analysis (e.g., binary diffing). However, the lifted IR code appears unsuited to rigorous static analysis (e.g., pointer analysis). To obtain a more comprehensive view of the utility of binary lifters, we also compare the performance of lifter-enabled approaches with that of binary-only tools in three security tasks, i.e., sanitization, binary diffing, and C decompilation. We summarize our findings and make suggestions for the correct use and further enhancement of binary lifters. We also explored practical ways to enhance the accuracy of pointer analysis using lifted IR code, by using and augmenting Debin, a tool for predicting debug information.},

Attackers target ICS, mainly programmable logic controllers (PLC), to sabotage underlying infrastructure. A PLC controls a physical process through connected sensors and actuators. It runs a control-logic program that specifies monitoring and controlling a physical process and is a common target of cyberattacks. A vendor-provided proprietary engineering software is typically used to investigate the infected control logic. This paper shows that an attacker can use control-logic obfuscation as an anti-forensics technique to hinder the investigations and incident response. The control-logic obfuscation subverts the engineering software’s decompilation function; therefore, we call it a denial-of-decompilation attack. The attack exploits a fundamental design principle of creating compiled control logic in engineering software, thereby affecting the engineering software of multiple vendors in the industry.},

To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a binary vulnerability mining technology based on neural network feature fusion. Firstly, this method constructs binary vulnerability data sets containing multiple vulnerability types, then decompile them to the pcode intermediate language level, and then extracts relevant feature vectors from binary vulnerability data sets according to Bert fine tuning model and bilstm model respectively. In order to fully obtain the semantic information of vulnerabilities, this method standardized the two, fused them, and carried out relevant experiments. The experimental results show that the accuracy of vulnerability detection on SARD data set is 96.92%, which is higher than other binary vulnerability detection methods based on neural network.},

  abstract = {The software compilation process has a tendency to obscure the original design of the system and makes it difficult both to identify individual components and discern their purpose simply by examining the resulting binary code. Although decompilation techniques attempt to recover higher-level source code from the machine code in question, they are not fully able to restore the semantics of the original functions. Furthermore, binaries are often stripped of metadata, and this makes it challenging to reverse engineer complex binary software. In this paper we show how a combination of binary decomposition techniques, decompilation passes, and LLM-powered function summarization can be used to build an economical engine to identify modules in stripped binaries and associate them with high-level natural language descriptions. We instantiated this technique with three underlying open-source LLMs -- CodeQwen, DeepSeek-Coder and CodeStral -- and measured its effectiveness in identifying modules in robotics firmware. This experimental evaluation involved 467 modules from four devices from the ArduPilot software suite, and showed that CodeStral, the best-performing backend LLM, achieves an average F1-score of 0.68 with an online running time of just a handful of seconds. },

  abstract = {Cryptographic libraries are a main target of timing side-channel attacks. A practical means to protect against these attacks is to adhere to the constant-time (CT) policy. However, it is hard to write constant-time code, and even constant-time code can be turned vulnerable by mainstream compilers. So how can we verify that binary code is constant-time? The obvious answer is to use binary-level CT tools. To do so, a common approach is to use decompilers or lifters as a front-end for CT analysis tools operating on source code or IR. Unfortunately, this approach is problematic with current decompilers. To illustrate this fact, we use the recent Clangover vulnerability and other constructed examples to show that five popular decompilers eliminate CT violations, rendering them not applicable with the approach. In this paper, we develop foundations to asses whether a decompiler is fit for the Decompile-then-Analyze approach. We propose CT transparency, which states that a transformation neither eliminates nor introduces CT violations, and a general method for proving that a program transformation is CT transparent. Then, we build CT-RetDec, a CT analysis tool based on a modified version of the LLVM-based decompiler RetDec. We evaluate CT-RetDec on a benchmark of real-world vulnerabilities in binaries, and show that the modifications had significant impact on CT-RetDec's performance. As a contribution of independent interest, we found that popular tools for binary-level CT analysis rely on decompiler-like transformations before analysis. We show that two such tools employ transformations that are not CT transparent, and, consequently, that they incorrectly accept non-CT programs. While our examples are very specific and do not invalidate the general approach of these tools, we advocate that tool developers counter such potential issues by proving the transparency of such transformations. },

  abstract = {Binary-source code matching plays an important role in many security and software engineering related tasks such as malware detection, reverse engineering and vulnerability assessment. Currently, several approaches have been proposed for binary-source code matching by jointly learning the embeddings of binary code and source code in a common vector space. Despite much effort, existing approaches target on matching the binary code and source code written in a single programming language. However, in practice, software applications are often written in different programming languages to cater for different requirements and computing platforms. Matching binary and source code across programming languages introduces additional challenges when maintaining multi-language and multi-platform applications. To this end, this paper formulates the problem of cross-language binary-source code matching, and develops a new dataset for this new problem. We present a novel approach XLIR, which is a Transformer-based neural network by learning the intermediate representations for both binary and source code. To validate the effectiveness of XLIR, comprehensive experiments are conducted on two tasks of cross-language binary-source code matching, and cross-language source-source code matching, on top of our curated dataset. Experimental results and analysis show that our proposed XLIR with intermediate representations significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art models in both of the two tasks.},

  abstract = {Binary code similarity detection (BCSD) has various applications, including but not limited to vulnerability detection, plagiarism detection, and malware detection. Previous research efforts mainly focus on transforming binary code to assembly code strings using reverse compilation and then using pre-trained deep learning models with large parameters to obtain feature representation vector of binary code. While these models have proven to be effective in representing binary code, their large parameter size leads to considerable computational expenses during both training and inference. In this paper, we present a lightweight neural network, called FastBCSD, that employs a dynamic instruction vector encoding method and takes only assembly code as input feature to achieve comparable accuracy to the pre-training models while reducing the computational resources and time cost. On the BinaryCorp dataset, our method achieves a similar average MRR score to the state-of-the-art pre-training-based method (jTrans), while on the BinaryCorp 3M dataset, our method even outperforms the latest technology by 0.01. Notably, FastBCSD has a much smaller parameter size (13.4M) compared to jTrans (87.88M), and its latency time is 1/5 of jTrans on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti.},

  abstract = {Human-Oriented Binary Reverse Engineering (HOBRE) lies at the intersection of binary and source code, aiming to lift binary code to human-readable content relevant to source code, thereby bridging the binary-source semantic gap. Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE. However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively. In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis. Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context. This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3\% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7\% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7\% and 7.4\% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in automating and improving binary code analysis.},

However, only a small number of Ethereum contracts have released their source code, so vulnerability detection at the bytecode level is crucial. This paper introduces SmartBugBert, a novel approach that combines BERT-based deep learning with control flow graph (CFG) analysis to detect vulnerabilities directly from bytecode. Our method first decompiles smart contract bytecode into optimized opcode sequences, extracts semantic features using TF-IDF, constructs control flow graphs to capture execution logic, and isolates vulnerable CFG fragments for targeted analysis. By integrating both semantic and structural information through a fine-tuned BERT model and LightGBM classifier, our approach effectively identifies four critical vulnerability types: transaction-ordering, access control, self-destruct, and timestamp dependency vulnerabilities. Experimental evaluation on 6,157 Ethereum smart contracts demonstrates that SmartBugBert achieves 90.62% precision, 91.76% recall, and 91.19% F1-score, significantly outperforming existing detection methods. Ablation studies confirm that the combination of semantic features with CFG information substantially enhances detection performance. Furthermore, our approach maintains efficient detection speed (0.14 seconds per contract), making it practical for large-scale vulnerability assessment. },

@article{Butz2020,
  abstract = {There exists a dichotomy between classical probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian networks (BNs), and modern tractable models, such as sum-product networks (SPNs). The former generally have intractable inference, but provide a high level of interpretability, while the latter admits a wide range of tractable inference routines, but are typically harder to interpret. Due to this dichotomy, tools to convert between BNs and SPNs are desirable. While one direction -- compiling BNs into SPNs -- is well discussed in Darwiche's seminal work on arithmetic circuit compilation, the converse direction -- decompiling SPNs into BNs -- has received surprisingly little attention. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing SPN2BN, an algorithm that decompiles an SPN into a BN. SPN2BN has several salient features when compared to the only other two works decompiling SPNs. Most significantly, the BNs returned by SPN2BN are minimal independence-maps that are more parsimonious with respect to the introduction of latent variables. Secondly, the output BN produced by SPN2BN can be precisely characterized with respect to a compiled BN. More specifically, a certain set of directed edges will be added to the input BN, giving what we will call the moral-closure. Lastly, it is established that our compilation-decompilation process is idempotent. This has practical significance as it limits the size of the decompiled SPN. },

  abstract = {The ability to identify authors of computer programs based on their coding style is a direct threat to the privacy and anonymity of programmers. While recent work found that source code can be attributed to authors with high accuracy, attribution of executable binaries appears to be much more difficult. Many distinguishing features present in source code, e.g. variable names, are removed in the compilation process, and compiler optimization may alter the structure of a program, further obscuring features that are known to be useful in determining authorship. We examine programmer de-anonymization from the standpoint of machine learning, using a novel set of features that include ones obtained by decompiling the executable binary to source code. We adapt a powerful set of techniques from the domain of source code authorship attribution along with stylistic representations embedded in assembly, resulting in successful de-anonymization of a large set of programmers. We evaluate our approach on data from the Google Code Jam, obtaining attribution accuracy of up to 96% with 100 and 83% with 600 candidate programmers. We present an executable binary authorship attribution approach, for the first time, that is robust to basic obfuscations, a range of compiler optimization settings, and binaries that have been stripped of their symbol tables. We perform programmer de-anonymization using both obfuscated binaries, and real-world code found "in the wild" in single-author GitHub repositories and the recently leaked Nulled.IO hacker forum. We show that programmers who would like to remain anonymous need to take extreme countermeasures to protect their privacy. },

Although multicore architectures are ubiquitous, the state-of-the-art translation tools do not handle concurrency primitives correctly. Doing so is rather challenging because of the subtle differences in the concurrency models between architectures. In response, we address various aspects of the challenge. First, we develop correct and efficient translations between the concurrency models of two mainstream architecture families: x86 and ARM (versions 7 and 8). We develop direct mappings between x86 and ARMv8 and ARMv7, and fence elimination algorithms to eliminate redundant fences after direct mapping. Although our mapping utilizes ARMv8 as an intermediate model for mapping between x86 and ARMv7, we argue that it should not be used as an intermediate model in a decompiler because it disallows common compiler transformations. Second, we propose and implement a technique for inserting memory fences for safely migrating programs between different architectures. Our technique checks robustness against x86 and ARM, and inserts fences upon robustness violations. Our experiments demonstrate that in most of the programs both our techniques introduce significantly fewer fences compared to naive schemes for porting applications across these architectures. },

Commercial malware detection software can be costly, and tools that attribute malware to the specific software vulnerabilities it exploits are largely lacking. Understanding the connection between malware and the vulnerabilities it targets is crucial for analyzing past threats and proactively defending against current ones. In this study, we propose an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware, specifically within JAR files, and uses LLM capabilities combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept tool, MalCVE, that integrates binary code decompilation, deobfuscation, LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and LLM-based CVE classification. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of 3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware-detection accuracy of 97%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. In particular, the results demonstrate that LLM-based code summarization enables highly accurate and explainable malware identification. MalCVE is also the first tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65%, which is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code. },

  abstract = {Analyzing third-party software such as malware or firmware is a crucial task for security analysts. Although various approaches for automatic analysis exist and are the subject of ongoing research, analysts often have to resort to manual static analysis to get a deep understanding of a given binary sample. Since the source code of encountered samples is rarely available, analysts regularly employ decompilers for easier and faster comprehension than analyzing a binary's disassembly. In this paper, we introduce our decompilation approach dewolf. We developed a variety of improvements over the previous academic state-of-the-art decompiler and some novel algorithms to enhance readability and comprehension, focusing on manual analysis. To evaluate our approach and to obtain a better insight into the analysts' needs, we conducted three user surveys. The results indicate that dewolf is suitable for malware comprehension and that its output quality noticeably exceeds Ghidra and Hex-Rays in certain aspects. Furthermore, our results imply that decompilers aiming at manual analysis should be highly configurable to respect individual user preferences. Additionally, future decompilers should not necessarily follow the unwritten rule to stick to the code-structure dictated by the assembly in order to produce readable output.

  abstract = {In software reverse engineering, decompilation is the process of recovering source code from binary files. Decompilers are used when it is necessary to understand or analyze software for which the source code is not available. Although existing decompilers commonly obtain source code with the same behavior as the binaries, that source code is usually hard to interpret and certainly differs from the original code written by the programmer. Massive codebases could be used to build supervised machine learning models aimed at improving existing decompilers. In this article, we build different classification models capable of inferring the high-level type returned by functions, with significantly higher accuracy than existing decompilers. We automatically instrument C source code to allow the association of binary patterns with their corresponding high-level constructs. A dataset is created with a collection of real open-source applications plus a huge number of synthetic programs. Our system is able to predict function return types with a 79.1% F1-measure, whereas the best decompiler obtains a 30% F1-measure. Moreover, we document the binary patterns used by our classifier to allow their addition in the implementation of existing decompilers. },

  abstract = {Recognizing vulnerabilities in stripped binary files presents a significant challenge in software security. Although some progress has been made in generating human-readable information from decompiled binary files with Large Language Models (LLMs), effectively and scalably detecting vulnerabilities within these binary files is still an open problem. This paper explores the novel application of LLMs to detect vulnerabilities within these binary files. We demonstrate the feasibility of identifying vulnerable programs through a combined approach of decompilation optimization to make the vulnerabilities more prominent and long-term memory for a larger context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in binary vulnerability analysis. Our findings highlight the potential for LLMs to overcome the limitations of traditional analysis methods and advance the field of binary vulnerability detection, paving the way for more secure software systems. In this paper, we present Vul-BinLLM , an LLM-based framework for binary vulnerability detection that mirrors traditional binary analysis workflows with fine-grained optimizations in decompilation and vulnerability reasoning with an extended context. In the decompilation phase, Vul-BinLLM adds vulnerability and weakness comments without altering the code structure or functionality, providing more contextual information for vulnerability reasoning later. Then for vulnerability reasoning, Vul-BinLLM combines in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting along with a memory management agent to enhance accuracy. Our evaluations encompass the commonly used synthetic dataset Juliet to evaluate the potential feasibility for analysis and vulnerability detection in C/C++ binaries. Our evaluations show that Vul-BinLLM is highly effective in detecting vulnerabilities on the compiled Juliet dataset. },

To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code.

Existing literature has proposed several techniques; however, a quick survey reveals a lack of clarity in the types of techniques proposed, and how many are unique. What is also unclear is whether there is a disparity in the theory and practice of CFO. In this paper, we systematically study CFO techniques proposed for Java programs, both from papers and commercially available tools. We evaluate 13 obfuscators using a dataset of 16 programs with varying software characteristics, and different obfuscator parameters. Each program is carefully reverse engineered to study the effect of obfuscation. Our study reveals that there are 36 unique techniques proposed in the literature and 7 from tools. Three of the most popular commercial obfuscators implement only 13 of the 36 techniques in the literature. Thus there appears to be a gap between the theory and practice of CFO. We propose a novel classification of the obfuscation techniques based on the underlying component of a program that is transformed. We identify the techniques that are potent against reverse engineering attacks, both from the perspective of a human analyst and an automated program decompiler. Our analysis reveals that majority of the tools do not implement these techniques, thus defeating the protection obfuscation offers. We furnish examples of select techniques and discuss our findings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to assemble such a research. This study will be useful to software designers to decide upon the best techniques to use based upon their needs, for researchers to understand the state-of-the-art and for commercial obfuscator developers to develop new techniques. },

In recent years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf\{19,448\} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \textbf\{19\} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation. },

SMT solvers, which serve as a foundation for these tools, have thus increased support for bitvector reasoning through bit-blasting and linear arithmetic approximations. In this paper we show that similar linear arithmetic approximation of bitvector operations can be done at the source level through transformations. Specifically, we introduce new paths that over-approximate bitvector operations with linear conditions/constraints, increasing branching but allowing us to better exploit the well-developed integer reasoning and interpolation of verification tools. We show that, for reachability of bitvector programs, increased branching incurs negligible overhead yet, when combined with integer interpolation optimizations, enables more programs to be verified. We further show this exploitation of integer interpolation in the common case also enables competitive termination verification of bitvector programs and leads to the first effective technique for LTL verification of bitvector programs. Finally, we provide an in-depth case study of decompiled ("lifted") binary programs, which emulate X86 execution through frequent use of bitvector operations. We present a new tool DarkSea, the first tool capable of verifying reachability, termination, and LTL of lifted binaries. },

  abstract = {Security experts reverse engineer (decompile) binary code to identify critical security vulnerabilities. The limited access to source code in vital systems - such as firmware, drivers, and proprietary software used in Critical Infrastructures (CI) - makes this analysis even more crucial on the binary level. Even with available source code, a semantic gap persists after compilation between the source and the binary code executed by the processor. This gap may hinder the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. That being said, current research on Large Language Models (LLMs) overlooks the significance of decompiled binaries in this area by focusing solely on source code. In this work, we are the first to empirically uncover the substantial semantic limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs when it comes to analyzing vulnerabilities in decompiled binaries, largely due to the absence of relevant datasets. To bridge the gap, we introduce DeBinVul, a novel decompiled binary code vulnerability dataset. Our dataset is multi-architecture and multi-optimization, focusing on C/C++ due to their wide usage in CI and association with numerous vulnerabilities. Specifically, we curate 150,872 samples of vulnerable and non-vulnerable decompiled binary code for the task of (i) identifying; (ii) classifying; (iii) describing vulnerabilities; and (iv) recovering function names in the domain of decompiled binaries. Subsequently, we fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using DeBinVul and report on a performance increase of 19%, 24%, and 21% in the capabilities of CodeLlama, Llama3, and CodeGen2 respectively, in detecting binary code vulnerabilities. Additionally, using DeBinVul, we report a high performance of 80-90% on the vulnerability classification task.

Results: We developed the algorithms for the following operations: preprocessing assembly code, searching data accesses, extracting system values, decompiling arithmetic operations and recovering data types. We also developed templates for decompilation of branching operations. Practical relevance: We implemented the presented algorithms in Python as a tool called OpenCLDecompiler, which supports a large subset of AMD GCN instructions. This tool automatically converts disassembled GPGPU code into the equivalent OpenCL code, which reduces the effort required to analyze assembly code. },

However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage. We also conduct investigations into components within CovAgent to reveal further insights regarding the efficacy of Agentic AI in the field of automated app testing such as the agentic activation condition inference accuracy, and agentic activity-launching success rate. },

Given that the main purpose of decompilation is to facilitate code comprehension in scenarios where the source code is unavailable, the understandability of decompiled code is of great importance. In this paper, we propose the first empirical study on the understandability of Java decompiled code and obtained the following findings: (1) Understandability of Java decompilation is considered as important as its correctness, and decompilation understandability issues are even more commonly encountered than decompilation failures. (2) A notable percentage of code snippets decompiled by Java decompilers exhibit significantly lower or higher levels of understandability in comparison to their original source code. (3) Unfortunately, Cognitive Complexity demonstrates relatively acceptable precision while low recall in recognizing these code snippets exhibiting diverse understandability during decompilation. (4) Even worse, perplexity demonstrates lower levels of precision and recall in recognizing such code snippets. Inspired by the four findings, we further proposed six code patterns and the first metric for the assessment of decompiled code understandability. This metric was extended from Cognitive Complexity, with six more rules harvested from an exhaustive manual analysis into 1287 pairs of source code snippets and corresponding decompiled code. This metric was also validated using the original and updated dataset, yielding an impressive macro F1-score of 0.88 on the original dataset, and 0.86 on the test set. },

  abstract = {Hardware decompilation reverses logic synthesis, converting a gate-level digital electronic design, or netlist, back up to hardware description language (HDL) code. Existing techniques decompile data-oriented features in netlists, like loops and modules, but struggle with sequential logic. In particular, they cannot decompile memory elements, which pose difficulty due to their deconstruction into individual bits and the feedback loops they form in the netlist. Recovering multi-bit registers and memory blocks from netlists would expand the applications of hardware decompilation, notably towards retargeting technologies (e.g. FPGAs to ASICs) and decompiling processor memories. We devise a method for register aggregation, to identify relationships between the data flip-flops in a netlist and group them into registers and memory blocks, resulting in HDL code that instantiates these memory elements. We aggregate flip-flops by identifying common enable pins, and derive the bit-order of the resulting registers using functional dependencies. This scales similarly to memory blocks, where we repeat the algorithm in the second dimension with special attention to the read, write, and address ports of each memory block. We evaluate our technique over a dataset of 13 gate-level netlists, comprising circuits from binary multipliers to CPUs, and we compare the quantity and widths of recovered registers and memory blocks with the original source code. The technique successfully recovers memory elements in all of the tested circuits, even aggregating beyond the source code expectation. In 10 / 13 circuits, all source code memory elements are accounted for, and we are able to compact up to 2048 disjoint bits into a single memory block. },

  abstract = {Binary analysis is a core component of many critical security tasks, including reverse engineering, malware analysis, and vulnerability detection. Manual analysis is often time-consuming, but identifying commonly-used or previously-seen functions can reduce the time it takes to understand a new file. However, given the complexity of assembly, and the NP-hard nature of determining function equivalence, this task is extremely difficult. Common approaches often use sophisticated disassembly and decompilation tools, graph analysis, and other expensive pre-processing steps to perform function similarity searches over some corpus. In this work, we identify a number of discrepancies between the current research environment and the underlying application need. To remedy this, we build a new benchmark, REFuSE-Bench, for binary function similarity detection consisting of high-quality datasets and tests that better reflect real-world use cases. In doing so, we address issues like data duplication and accurate labeling, experiment with real malware, and perform the first serious evaluation of ML binary function similarity models on Windows data. Our benchmark reveals that a new, simple basline, one which looks at only the raw bytes of a function, and requires no disassembly or other pre-processing, is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple settings. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions that complex models with highly-engineered features are being used to their full potential, and demonstrate that simpler approaches can provide significant value. },

  abstract = {Binary analysis remains pivotal in software security, offering insights into compiled programs without source code access. As large language models (LLMs) continue to excel in diverse language understanding and generation tasks, their potential in decoding complex binary data structures becomes evident. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks in this domain limits the assessment and comparison of LLM's capabilities in binary analysis and hinders the progress of research and practical applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce BinMetric, a comprehensive benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the performance of large language models on binary analysis tasks. BinMetric comprises 1,000 questions derived from 20 real-world open-source projects across 6 practical binary analysis tasks, including decompilation, code summarization, assembly instruction generation, etc., which reflect actual reverse engineering scenarios. Our empirical study on this benchmark investigates the binary analysis capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing their strengths and limitations in this field. The findings indicate that while LLMs show strong potential, challenges still exist, particularly in the areas of precise binary lifting and assembly synthesis. In summary, BinMetric makes a significant step forward in measuring the binary analysis capabilities of LLMs, establishing a new benchmark leaderboard, and our study provides valuable insights for the future development of these LLMs in software security. },

  abstract = {Manual translation of the algorithms from sequential version to its parallel counterpart is time consuming and can be done only with the specific knowledge of hardware accelerator architecture, parallel programming or programming environment. The automation of this process makes porting the code much easier and faster. The key aspect in this case is how efficient the generated parallel code will be. The paper describes J-Parallelio, the framework for automatic analysis of the bytecode source codes and its parallelisation on multicore processors. The process consists of a few steps. First step is a process of decompilation of JVM and its translation to internal abstract syntax tree, the dependency extraction and memory analysis is performed. Finally, the mapping process is performed which consists of a set of rules responsible for translating the input virtual machine source code to its parallel version. The main novelty is that it can deal with pure Java virtual machine and can generate parallel code for multicore processors. This makes the system portable and it can work with different languages based on JVM after some small modifications. The efficiency of automatically translated source codes were compared with their manually written counterparts on chosen benchmarks. },

  abstract = {In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations (IR) to improve code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic information and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and produces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation (NMT) approaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one can get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as sequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between similar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages. The consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of NMT, and stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy. Here we propose to augment code translation with IRs, specifically LLVM IR, with results on the C++, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon the state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number of correct translations by 11% on average, and up to 79% for the Java -> Rust pair with greedy decoding. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of Go and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on the problem of IR decompilation, generating programming source code from IR, and study using IRs as intermediary pivot for translation. },

  abstract = {Recent advances in LLM-based decompilers have been shown effective to convert low-level binaries into human-readable source code. However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLM decompilation technology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Decompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmark Decompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues. We further explore commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide a thorough assessment of the studied LLM decompilers and find that fine-tuning with Decompile-Bench causes a 20% improvement over previous benchmarks in terms of the re-executability rate.

However, as with other neural network models, there is currently no general method available to explain their inner workings. The present paper represents a first step towards this direction. We utilize \textit\{Transformer Compiler for RASP\} (Tracr) to generate a large dataset of pairs of transformer weights and corresponding RASP programs. Based on this dataset, we then build and train a model, with the aim of recovering the RASP code from the compiled model. We demonstrate that the simple form of Tracr compiled transformer weights is interpretable for such a decompiler model. In an empirical evaluation, our model achieves exact reproductions on more than 30\% of the test objects, while the remaining 70\% can generally be reproduced with only few errors. Additionally, more than 70\% of the programs, produced by our model, are functionally equivalent to the ground truth, and therefore a valid decompilation of the Tracr compiled transformer weights. },

Pictographic characters, which combine visual form with symbolic structure, provide an ideal test case for this capability. We formulate this visual recognition challenge in the mathematical domain, where each character is represented by an executable program of geometric primitives. This is framed as a program synthesis task, training a VLM to decompile raster images into programs composed of Bézier curves. Our model, acting as a "visual decompiler", demonstrates performance superior to strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o. The most significant finding is that when trained solely on modern Chinese characters, the model is able to reconstruct ancient Oracle Bone Script in a zero-shot context. This generalization provides strong evidence that the model acquires an abstract and transferable geometric grammar, moving beyond pixel-level pattern recognition to a more structured form of visual understanding. },

  abstract = {With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has been paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various educational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on blockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by developers for its ``event-triggered" mechanism for building education intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified, so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly, the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG) are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the vulnerability detection of smart contracts. Compared with the traditional approaches, it can get good results with fewer layers of the GCN model, which shows that the contract bytecode and GCN model are efficient in vulnerability detection. },

were acquired. Then these traces were modeled as execution sequences and
then simplified so as to get simplified sequences (SFS), followed by the
extraction of patterns through pattern extraction (PE) algorithm from
SFS. After that, evalu-ating indicators inner-importance and
inter-importance were designed to measure the note-worthiness of
functions in DNFM algorithm. Finally, these functions were sorted by
their noteworthiness. Comparison and contrast were conducted on the

  abstract = {Android provides a permission declaration and a certification mechanism
to detect and report potential security threats of applications.
Normally, an application is certified based on its declared permissions,
but declared permissions are often coarse-grained or inconsistent with
those actually used in the program code. The authors propose application
programming interface (API)-level security certification of android
applications (ASCAA), a cloud-based framework, which employs a
systematic method to identify and analyse security threats at API level.
To certify an application, ASCAA examines all permission labels in its
manifest and API invocations extracted from its decompiled code based on
a set of requirementdependent security rules. In addition, the authors
provide ASCAA Security Language to formalise security rules and the
certification process, which makes ASCAA general and scalable. Since it
is a cloud-based framework, any potential user could easily make ASCAA
work for them, and ASCAA has also been proved to gain high performance.
Hitherto, they have analysed over 200 applications with an automated
tool based on ASCAA, and discovered that about one-eighth failed to pass
part of our sample rules. We find evidence that ASCAA can identify risk
factors in a fine-grained way, for example, applications' being over
privileged or the use of some dangerous APIs require no permission
declaration.},

  abstract = {This study addresses the challenge of performing fast and accurate
titrations with end points that are difficult to identify. In this
sense, the combination of digital movies (DMs) with a flow-batch
analyzer (FBA) has shown to be a promising analytical tool. In a digital
movie-based automatic titrator (DMB-AT), a DM is recorded by a webcam as
the titrant is added in the mixing chamber (MC). The DM is then
decompiled into frames that are ordered sequentially. In the first
frame, the region of interest (ROI) of 257 x 255 pixels is defined. The
red (R) component is used to calculate the Pearson's correlation
coefficient (r) between the first frame and each subsequent one. The
titration curve is obtained in real time by plotting r values and the
opening time of the titrant valve. The experimental titration curve is
fitted in a sigmoidal regression, and the new titration curve is used to
estimate the end point by means of the second derivative method. A
software program written in Adobe AIR for a desktop platform programmed
in ActionScript 3.0 controlled the opening time of the solenoid valves,
gathered the analytical signal and carried out the analytical procedure
in real time. The feasibility of the method was confirmed by determining
the total hardness and the total alkalinity in mineral waters. The
results were compared with classical batch titration and did not exhibit
statistically significant differences when the paired t-test at the 95\%
confidence level was applied. The proposed method is able to process
approximately 67 and 86 samples H-1 for total hardness and total
alkalinity, respectively. Its precision was confirmed by overall
relative standard deviation (RSD) values of less than 1.0\% in both
applications. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Android is now the most popular smartphone platform and remains rapid
growth. There are huge number of sensitive privacy information stored in
Android devices. Kinds of methods have been proposed to detect Android
malicious applications and protect the privacy information. In this
work, we focus on extracting the fine-grained features to maximize the
information of Android malware detection, and selecting the least joint
features to minimize the number of features. Firstly, permissions and
APIs, not only from Android permissions and SDK APIs but also from the
developer-defined permissions and third-party library APIs, are
extracted as features from the decompiled source codes. Secondly,
feature selection methods, including information gain (IG),
regularization and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, are
used to analyze and utilize the correlation between the features to
eliminate the redundant data, reduce the feature dimension and mine the
useful joint features. Furthermore, regularization and PSO are
integrated to create a new joint feature mining method. Experiment
results show that the joint feature mining method can utilize the
advantages of regularization and PSO, and ensure good performance and
efficiency for Android malware detection.},

  abstract = {Mobile security is an important issue on Android platform. Most malware
detection methods based on machine learning models heavily rely on
expert knowledge for manual feature engineering, which are still
difficult to fully describe malwares. In this paper, we present
LSTM-based hierarchical denoise network (HDN), a novel static Android
malware detection method which uses LSTM to directly learn from the raw
opcode sequences extracted from decompiled Android files. However, most
opcode sequences are too long for LSTM to train due to the gradient
vanishing problem. Hence, HDN uses a hierarchical structure, whose
first-level LSTM parallelly computes on opcode subsequences (we called
them method blocks) to learn the dense representations; then the
second-level LSTM can learn and detect malware through method block
sequences. Considering that malicious behavior only appears in partial
sequence segments, HDN uses method block denoise module (MBDM) for data
denoising by adaptive gradient scaling strategy based on loss cache. We
evaluate and compare HDN with the latest mainstream researches on three
datasets. The results show that HDN outperforms these Android malware
detection methods, and it is able to capture longer sequence features
and has better detection efficiency than N-gram-based malware detection
which is similar to our method.},

  abstract = {Software security of Android applications is especially susceptible
(vulnerable) to malicious reverse engineer than the native code based
software, because its Java bytecode is easier to decompile and to
reconstruct the original Java source code. Therefore obfuscation is an
essential criterion for the protection of Android applications.
Meanwhile, the unpredicted performance loss will be caused by the
obfuscation, which might seriously influence the user experience of the
software. Therefore the obfuscation degree and the performance cost out
of it require being optimized. In this paper, we are working on the
problem that: to obfuscate an Android application to a target level of
``difficulty{''} degree, while not substantially ``slowing it down{''}.
We measure ``difficulty{''} by utilizing software complexity metrics and
the ``slow{''} in CPU cycles. Within the framework designed for
obfuscating Android applications, we implement the ``Naive Bayesian
Classifier{''} algorithm for the optimized obfuscation of the software
complexity and the performance, and show that it outperforms the
algorithm whose predictions rely on mean values. We furthermore
investigate the performance penalty imposed by obfuscation process when
framework targets different complexity values and metrics. We show that
some obfuscation methods are more performance costly than others to
achieve the same metric value increase. Our result shows that, for any
given software complexity, the required performance benefits can be
achieved if the right obfuscation techniques are used. (C) 2017 Elsevier

  abstract = {Malware detection plays a crucial role in computer security. Recent
researches mainly use machine learning based methods heavily relying on
domain knowledge for manually extracting malicious features. In this
paper, we propose MalNet, a novel malware detection method that learns
features automatically from the raw data. Concretely, we first generate
a grayscale image from malware file, meanwhile extracting its opcode
sequences with the decompilation tool IDA. Then MalNet uses CNN and LSTM
networks to learn from grayscale image and opcode sequence,
respectively, and takes a stacking ensemble for malware classification.
We perform experiments on more than 40,000 samples including 20,650
benign files collected from online software providers and 21,736
malwares provided by Microsoft. The evaluation result shows that MalNet
achieves 99.88\% validation accuracy for malware detection. In addition,
we also take malware family classification experiment on 9 malware
families to compare MalNet with other related works, in which MalNet
outperforms most of related works with 99.36\% detection accuracy and
achieves a considerable speed-up on detecting efficiency comparing with
two state-of-the-art results on Microsoft malware dataset.},

  abstract = {Copying and pasting of source code is a common activity in software
engineering. Often, the code is not copied as it is and it may be
modified for various purposes; e.g. refactoring, bug fixing, or even
software plagiarism. These code modifications could affect the
performance of code similarity analysers including code clone and
plagiarism detectors to some certain degree. We are interested in two
types of code modification in this study: pervasive modifications, i.e.
transformations that may have a global effect, and local modifications,
i.e. code changes that are contained in a single method or code block.
We evaluate 30 code similarity detection techniques and tools using five
experimental scenarios for Java source code. These are (1) pervasively
modified code, created with tools for source code and bytecode
obfuscation, and boiler-plate code, (2) source code normalisation
through compilation and decompilation using different decompilers, (3)
reuse of optimal configurations over different data sets, (4) tool
evaluation using ranked-based measures, and (5) local + global code
modifications. Our experimental results show that in the presence of
pervasive modifications, some of the general textual similarity measures
can offer similar performance to specialised code similarity tools,
whilst in the presence of boiler-plate code, highly specialised source
code similarity detection techniques and tools outperform textual
similarity measures. Our study strongly validates the use of
compilation/decompilation as a normalisation technique. Its use reduced
false classifications to zero for three of the tools. Moreover, we
demonstrate that optimal configurations are very sensitive to a specific
data set. After directly applying optimal configurations derived from
one data set to another, the tools perform poorly on the new data set.
The code similarity analysers are thoroughly evaluated not only based on
several well-known pair-based and query-based error measures but also on
each specific type of pervasive code modification. This broad, thorough
study is the largest in existence and potentially an invaluable guide
for future users of similarity detection in source code.},

  abstract = {With the popularity of Android applications, Android malware has an
exponential growth trend. In order to detect Android malware
effectively, this paper proposes a novel lightweight static detection
model, TinyDroid, using instruction simplification and machine learning
technique. First, a symbol-based simplification method is proposed to
abstract the opcode sequence decompiled from Android Dalvik Executable
files. Then, N-gram is employed to extract features from the simplified
opcode sequence, and a classifier is trained for the malware detection
and classification tasks. To improve the efficiency and scalability of
the proposed detection model, a compression procedure is also used to
reduce features and select exemplars for the malware sample datasct.
TinyDroid is compared against the state-of-the-art antivirus tools in
real world using Drebin dataset. The experimental results show that
TinyDroid can get a higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate with
satisfied efficiency.},

  abstract = {Mobile app ads pose a far greater security threat to users than adverts
on computer browsers. This is because app developers must embed a
Software Development Kit (SDK), called an ad library or ad lib for
short, provided by ad networks (i.e., ad companies) into their app
program, and then merge and compile it into an Android PacKage (APK)
execution file. The ad lib thus becomes a part of the entire app, and
shares the whole permissions granted to the app. Unfortunately, this
also resulted in many security issues, such as ad libs abusing the
permissions to collect and leak private data, ad servers redirecting ad
requests to download malicious JavaScript from unknown servers to
execute it in the background of the mobile operating system without the
user's consent. The more well-known an embedded ad lib, the safer the
app may be, and vice versa. Importantly, while decompiling an APK to
inspect its source code may not identify the ad lib(s), executing the
app on a simulator can reveal the network behavior of the embedded ad
lib(s). Ad libs exhibit different behavior patterns when communicating
with ad servers. This study uses a dynamic analysis method to inspect an
executing app, and plots the ad lib behavior patterns related to the
advertisement into a graph. It is then determined whether or not the ad
lib is from a trusted ad network using comparisons of graph
similarities.},

  abstract = {Software defect prediction locates defective code to help developers
improve the security of software. However, existing studies on software
defect prediction are mostly limited to the source code. Defect
prediction for Android binary executables (called apks) has never been
explored in previous studies. In this paper, we propose an explorative
study of defect prediction in Android apks. We first propose smali2vec,
a new approach to generate features that capture the characteristics of
smali (decompiled files of apks) files in apks. Smali2vec extracts both
token and semantic features of the defective files in apks and such
comprehensive features are needed for building accurate prediction
models. Then we leverage deep neural network (DNN), which is one of the
most common architecture of deep learning networks, to train and build
the defect prediction model in order to achieve accuracy. We apply our
defect prediction model to more than 90,000 smali files from 50 Android
apks and the results show that our model could achieve an AUC (the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 85.98\% and it is
capable of predicting defects in apks. Furthermore, the DNN is proved to
have a better performance than the traditional shallow machine learning
algorithms (e.g., support vector machine and naive bayes) used in
previous studies. The model has been used in our practical work and
helped locate many defective files in apks.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach for predicting program properties from large
codebases (aka ``Big Code{''}). Our approach learns a probabilistic
model from ``Big Code{''} and uses this model to predict properties of
new, unseen programs.
The key idea of our work is to transform the program into a
representation that allows us to formulate the problem of inferring
program properties as structured prediction in machine learning. This
enables us to leverage powerful probabilistic models such as Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) and perform joint prediction of program properties.
As an example of our approach, we built a scalable prediction engine
called JSNICE for solving two kinds of tasks in the context of
JavaScript: predicting (syntactic) names of identifiers and predicting
(semantic) type annotations of variables. Experimentally, JSNICE
predicts correct names for 63\% of name identifiers and its type
annotation predictions are correct in 81\% of cases. Since its public
release at http://jsnice.org, JSNice has become a popular system with
hundreds of thousands of uses.
By formulating the problem of inferring program properties as structured
prediction, our work opens up the possibility for a range of new ``Big
Code{''} applications such as de-obfuscators, decompilers, invariant
generators, and others.},

  abstract = {Repackaging of applications is one of the key attack vectors for mobile
malware. This is particularly easy and popular in Android Markets, where
applications can be downloaded, decompiled, modified and re-uploaded at
a very low cost. Detecting clones and victims is often a hard task,
especially in markets with several million of applications to analyze,
such as Google Play Store. This work proposes CloneSpot, a novel
methodology to efficiently detect Repackaged versions of Android apps
using Min Hashing techniques applied to applications' meta-data publicly
available at Google Play. We validate our approach by analyzing 1.3
Million of applications collected from Google Play in September 2017,
from which around 420K are detected as potential repackaged or victim

As a demonstration, in silico combinations of the building blocks

  abstract = {Pirated application developers find an alternate way to publish pirated
versions of the same Android mobile applications (apps) on different
Android markets. Therefore, a centralized, automated scrutiny system
among multiple app stores is inevitable to prevent publishing pirated or
cloned version of these Android applications. In this paper, we proposed
an Android clone detection system for Internet of things (IoT)
(Droid-IoT) devices. First, the proposed system receives an original
Android application package (APK) file along with possible candidate
cloned APKs over the cloud network. The system uses an apkExtractor tool
to extract Dalvik Executable (DEX) files for each subject program. The
Jdex decompiler is used to extract Java source files from DEXs. Then,
the bag-of-word model is used to extract tokenized features from source
files. Further, the weighting filters are used to zoom the importance of
each token. Moreover, Synthetic Minority Oversampling is applied to
retrieve balanced features for better training of data. Finally,
TensorFlow with Keras deep learning model is designed to predict clones

Droid-IoT can successfully detect cloned apps with an accuracy of up to
96\%. The primary purpose of this system is to prevent the publishing of

  abstract = {Android usually employs the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to
protect the user's privacy in network transmission. However, developers
may misuse SSL-related APIs, which would lead attackers to steal user's
privacy through man-in-the-middle attacks. Existing methods based on
static decompiling technology to detect SSL security vulnerabilities of
Android applications cannot cope with the increasingly common packed
applications. Meanwhile, dynamic analysis approaches have the
disadvantages of excessive resource consumption and time-consuming. In
this paper, we propose a dynamic method to solve this issue based on our
novel automatic traversal model. At first, we propose several new
traversal strategies to optimize the widget tree according to the user
interface (UI) types and the interface state similarity. Furthermore, we
develop a more granular traversal model by refining the traversal level
from the Activity component to the Widget and implement a heuristic
depth-first traversal algorithm in combination with our customized
traversal strategy. In addition, the man-in-the-middle agent plug-in is
extended to implement real-time attack test and return the attack
results. Based on the above ideas, we have implemented SSLDetecter, an
efficient automated detection system of Android application SSL security
vulnerability. We apply it on multiple devices in parallel to detect
2456 popular applications in several mainstream application markets and
find that 424 applications are suffering from SSL security
vulnerabilities. Compared with the existing system SMV-HUNTER, the time
efficiency of our system increases by 38\% and the average detection
rate increases by 6.39 percentage points, with many types of SSL
vulnerabilities detected.},

the vulnerabilities in the mobile device. The proposed mechanism is
validated through an experiment on an actual mobile device with four

  abstract = {Infringing intellectual property by reverse analysis is a severe threat
to Android applications. By replacing the program instructions with
virtual instructions that an adversary is unfamiliar with, code
obfuscation based on virtualization is a promising way of protecting
Android applications against reverse engineering. However, the current
code virtualization approaches for Android only target at the DEX
bytecode level. The DEX file with the open file format and more semantic
information makes the decode-dispatch pattern easier to expose, which
has been identified as a severe vulnerability of security and can be
exploited by various attacks. Further, decode-dispatch interpretation
frequently uses indirect branches in this structure to introduce extra
overhead. This paper presents a novel approach to transfer code
virtualization from DEX level to native level, which possesses strong
security strength and good stealth, with only modest cost. Our approach
contains two components: pre-compilation and compile-time
virtualization. Pre-compilation is designed for performance improvement
by identifying and decompiling the critical functions which consume a
significant fraction of execution time. Compile-time virtualization
builds upon the widely used LLVM compiler framework. It automatically
translates the DEX bytecode into the common LLVM intermediate
representations where a unified code virtualization pass can be applied
for DEX code. We have implemented a working prototype Dex2VM of our
technique and applied it to eight representative Android applications.
Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively
protect the target code against a state-of-the-art code reverse
engineering tool that is specifically designed for code virtualization,
and it achieves good stealth with only modest cost. (C) 2020 Elsevier

  abstract = {Due to the increasing growth in the variety of Android malware, it is
important to distinguish between the unique types of each. In this
paper, we introduce the use of a decompiled source code for malicious
code classification. This decompiled source code provides deeper
analysis opportunities and understanding of the nature of malware.
Malicious code differs from text due to syntax rules of compilers and
the effort of attackers to evade potential detection. Hence, we adapt
Natural Language Processing-based techniques under some constraints for
malicious code classification. First, the proposed methodology
decompiles the Android Package Kit files, then API calls, keywords, and
non-obfuscated tokens are extracted from the source code and categorized
to stop-tokens, feature-tokens, and long-tail-tokens. We also introduce
the use of generalized N-tokens to represent tokens that are typically
less frequent. Our approach was evaluated, in comparison to the use of
API calls and permissions for features, as a baseline, and their
combination, as well as in comparison to the use of neural network
architectures based on decompiled Android Package Kits. A rigorous
evaluation of comprehensive public real-world Android malware datasets,
including 24,553 apps that were categorized to 71 families for the
malicious families classification, and 60,000 apps for malicious code
detection was performed. Our approach outperformed the baselines in both
tasks. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Traditional machine learning based malware detection methods often use
decompiling techniques or dynamic monitoring techniques to extract the
feature representation of malware. This procedure is time consuming and
strongly depends on the skills of experts. In addition, malware can be
packed or encrypted to evade the analysis of decompiling tools. To solve
this issue, we propose a static detection method based on deep learning.
We directly extract bytecode file from Android APK file, and convert the
bytecode file into a two-dimensional bytecode matrix, then use the deep
learning algorithm, convolution neural network (CNN), to train a
detection model and apply it to classify malware. CNN can automatically
learn features of bytecode file which can be used to recognize malware.
The proposed detection model avoids the procedure for analyzing malware
features and designing the feature representation of malware. The
experimental results show the proposed method is effective to detect
malware, especially malware encrypted using polymorphic techniques.},

  abstract = {During compilation from Java source code to bytecode, some information
is irreversibly lost. In other words, compilation and decompilation of
Java code is not symmetric. Consequently, decompilation, which aims at
producing source code from bytecode, relies on strategies to reconstruct
the information that has been lost. Different Java decompilers use
distinct strategies to achieve proper decompilation. In this work, we
hypothesize that the diverse ways in which bytecode can be decompiled
has a direct impact on the quality of the source code produced by
decompilers.
In this paper, we assess the strategies of eight Java decompilers with
respect to three quality indicators: syntactic correctness, syntactic
distortion and semantic equivalence modulo inputs. Our results show that
no single modern decompiler is able to correctly handle the variety of
bytecode structures coming from real-world programs. The highest ranking
decompiler in this study produces syntactically correct, and
semantically equivalent code output for 84\%, respectively 78\%, of the
classes in our dataset. Our results demonstrate that each decompiler
correctly handles a different set of bytecode classes.
We propose a new decompiler called Arlecchino that leverages the
diversity of existing decompilers. To do so, we merge partial
decompilation into a new one based on compilation errors. Arlecchino
handles 37.6\% of bytecode classes that were previously handled by no
decompiler. We publish the sources of this new bytecode decompiler. (C)

  abstract = {The number of malware has exploded due to the openness of the Android
platform, and the endless stream of malware poses a threat to the
privacy, tariffs, and device of mobile phone users. A novel Android
mobile malware detection system is proposed, which employs an optimized
deep convolutional neural network to learn from opcode sequences. The
optimized convolutional neural network is trained multiple times by the
raw opcode sequences extracted from the decompiled Android file, so that
the feature information can be effectively learned and the malicious
program can be detected more accurately. More critically, thek-max
pooling method with better results is adopted in the pooling operation
phase, which improves the detection effect of the proposed method. The
experimental results show that the detection system achieved the
accuracy of 99\%, which is 2\%-11\% higher than the accuracy of the
machine learning detection algorithms when using the same data set. It
also ensures that the indicators, such as F1-score, recall, and
precision, are maintained above 97\%. Based on the detection system, a
multi-data set comparison experiment is carried out. The introducedk-max
pooling is deeply studied, and the effect ofkofk-max pooling on the
overall detection effect is observed.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods are gaining popularity in different application
domains, and especially in natural language processing. It is commonly
believed that using a large enough dataset and an adequate network
architecture, almost any processing problem can be solved. A frequent
and widely used typology is the encoder-decoder architecture, where the
input data is transformed into an intermediate code by means of an
encoder, and then a decoder takes this code to produce its output.
Different types of networks can be used in the encoder and the decoder,
depending on the problem of interest, such as convolutional neural
networks (CNN) or long-short term memories (LSTM). This paper uses for
the encoder a method recently proposed, called Causal Feature Extractor
(CFE). It is based on causal convolutions (i.e., convolutions that
depend only on one direction of the input), dilatation (i.e., increasing
the aperture size of the convolutions) and bidirectionality (i.e.,
independent networks in both directions). Some preliminary results are
presented on three different tasks and compared with state-of-the-art
methods: bilingual translation, LaTeX decompilation and audio
transcription. The proposed method achieves promising results, showing
its ubiquity to work with text, audio and images. Moreover, it has a
shorter training time, requiring less time per iteration, and a good use
of the attention mechanisms based on attention matrices.},

  abstract = {The fast-growing Android application market has attracted more and more
application developers. However, many plagiarists use decompiled tools
to modify original applications to get clones, which has become a
serious threat. For detecting cloned applications, most of the existing
schemes do not consider the detected accuracy and time consumption at
the same time. In this article, we proposea two-phase detection scheme
to achieve fast and accurate clone detection in large-scale
applications. In the rapid screening phase, a fix-length minhash summary
is constructed for each application and the locality-sensitive hashing
(LSH) algorithm is used to obtain suspicious cloned applications
quickly. In the accurate detection phase, by merging and pruning the
layout and interaction information of all user interfaces (UIs) at the
application runtime, we obtain the birthmark named merged layout tree
(MLT), which can resist nested obfuscation and repacking attack.
Finally, cloned apps are detected by calculating the similarity between
MLTs from suspicious cloned apps. We evaluate our detection scheme in
two app datasets (nearly 170,000 Android applications) and compare it
with the state-of-the-art clone detection methods. Extensive experiments
show that our method has high accuracy and efficiency for clone
detection in large-scale apps.},

  abstract = {Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem
for smart contracts: full-fledged intercommunicating programs that
capture the transaction logic of an account. A gas limit caps the
execution of an Ethereum smart contract: instructions, when executed,
consume gas, and the execution proceeds as long as gas is available.
Gas-focused vulnerabilities permit an attacker to force key contract
functionality to run out of gas-effectively performing a permanent
denial-of-service attack on the contract. Such vulnerabilities are among
the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior
may be uncommon in nonattack scenarios and reasoning about these
vulnerabilities is nontrivial.
In this paper, we identify gas-focused vulnerabilities and present
MadMax: a static program analysis technique that automatically detects
gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. MadMax combines a
smart contract decompiler and semantic queries in Datalog. Our approach
captures high-level program modeling concepts (such as ``dynamic data
structure storage{''} and ``safely resumable loops{''}) and delivers
high precision and scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart
contracts in the Ethereum blockchain in just 10 hours and flags
vulnerabilities in contracts with a monetary value in billions of
dollars. Manual inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that
81\% of the sampled warnings do indeed lead to vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {In industrial control systems (ICS), attackers inject malicious
control-logic into programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to sabotage
physical processes, such as nuclear plants, traffic-light signals,
elevators, and conveyor belts. For instance, Stuxnet operates by
transfering control logic to Siemens S7-300 PLCs over the network to
manipulate the motor speed of centrifuges. These devestating attacks are
referred to as control-logic injection attacks. Their network traffic,
if captured, contains malicious control logic that can be leveraged as a
forensic artifact. In this paper, we present Reditus to recover control
logic from a suspicious ICS network traffic. Reditus is based on the
observation that an engineering software has a built-in decompiler that
can transform the control logic into its source-code. Reditus integrates
the decompiler with a (previously-captured) set of network traffic from
a control-logic to recover the source code of the binary control-logic
automatically. We evaluate Reditus on the network traffic of 40 control
logic programs transferred from the SoMachine Basic engineering software
to a Modicon M221 PLC. Our evaluation successfully demonstrates that
Reditus can recover the source-code of a control logic from its network
traffic. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of

@article{WOS:000589187000048,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND:
The bispectral index (BIS) monitor has been available for clinical use
for >20 years and has had an immense impact on academic activity in
Anesthesiology, with >3000 articles referencing the bispectral index.
Despite attempts to infer its algorithms by external observation, its
operation has nevertheless remained undescribed, in contrast to the
algorithms of other less commercially successful monitors of
electroencephalogram (EEG) activity under anesthesia. With the
expiration of certain key patents, the time is therefore ripe to examine
the operation of the monitor on its own terms through careful
dismantling, followed by extraction and examination of its internal
software.
METHODS:
An A-2000 BIS Monitor (gunmetal blue case, amber monochrome display) was
purchased on the secondary market. After identifying the major data
processing and storage components, a set of free or inexpensive tools
was used to retrieve and disassemble the monitor's onboard software. The
software executes primarily on an ARMv7 microprocessor (Sharp/NXP
LH77790B) and a digital signal processor (Texas Instruments TMS320C32).
The device software can be retrieved directly from the monitor's
hardware by using debugging interfaces that have remained in place from
its original development.
RESULTS:
Critical numerical parameters such as the spectral edge frequency (SEF),
total power, and BIS values were retraced from external delivery at the
device's serial port back to the point of their calculation in the
extracted software. In doing so, the locations of the critical
algorithms were determined. To demonstrate the validity of the
technique, the algorithms for SEF and total power were disassembled,
comprehensively annotated and compared to their theoretically ideal
behaviors. A bug was identified in the device's implementation of the
SEF algorithm, which can be provoked by a perfectly isoelectric EEG.
CONCLUSIONS:
This article demonstrates that the electronic design of the A-2000 BIS
Monitor does not pose any insuperable obstacles to retrieving its device
software in hexadecimal machine code form directly from the motherboard.
This software can be reverse engineered through disassembly and
decompilation to reveal the methods by which the BIS monitor implements
its algorithms, which ultimately must form the definitive statement of
its function. Without further revealing any algorithms that might be
considered trade secrets, the manufacturer of the BIS monitor should be
encouraged to release the device software in its original format to
place BIS-related academic literature on a firm theoretical foundation
and to promote further academic development of EEG monitoring
algorithms.},

  abstract = {Purpose The online platform is one of the essential components of the
platform economy that is constructed by a large scale of the personal
data resource. However, accurate empirical test of the competition
structure of the data-driven online platform is still less. This
research is trying to reveal market allocation structure of the personal
data resource of China's car-hailing platforms competition by the
empirical data analysis. Design/methodology/approach This research is
applying the social network analysis by R packages, which include k-core
decomposition and multilevel community detection from the data
connectedness via the decompilation and the examination of the
application programming interface of terminal applications. Findings
This research has found that the car-hailing platforms, which establish
more constant personal data connectedness and connectivity with social
media platforms, are taking the competitive market advantage within the
sample network. Data access discrimination is a complementary method of
market power in China's car-hailing industry. Research
limitations/implications This research offers a new perspective on the
analysis of the multi-sided market from the personal data resource
allocation mechanism of the car-hailing platform. However, the
measurement of the data connectedness requires more empirical industry
data. Practical implications This research reveals the competition
structure that relies on personal data resource allocation mechanism. It
offers empirical evidence for governance, which is considered as the
critical issue of big data research, by reviewing the nature of the data
network. Social implications It also reveals the data convergence
process of the social system and the technological system.
Originality/value This research offers a new research method for the
real-time regulation of the car-hailing platform.},

  abstract = {Green and smart cities deliver services to their residents using mobile
applications that make daily life more convenient. The privacy and
security of these applications are significant in providing sustainable
services in a green city. The software cloning is a severe threat which
may breach the security and privacy of android applications. A centrally
controlled and automated screening system across multiple app stores is
inevitable to prevent the release of copyrighted or cloned copies of
these apps. In this paper, we proposed IoT-enabled green city
architecture for clone detection in android markets using a deep
learning approach. First, the proposed system obtained an original APK
file together with potential candidate cloned APKs via the cloud
network. For each subject software, the system uses an APK Extractor
tool to retrieve Dalvik Executable (DEX) files. The Jdex decompiler is
utilized to retrieve Java source files through Dalvik Executables.
Second, the AST features are extracted using ANother Tool for Language
Recognition (ANTLR) parser. Third, the linear features are mined from
these hierarchical structures, and Term Frequency Inverse Document
Frequency (TFIDF) is applied to estimate the significance of each
feature. Finally, the deep learning model is configured to detect cloned
apps. The deep learning model is fine-tuned to get better accuracy. The
proposed approach is analyzed on five different cloned applications
collected from different android markets. The main objective of this
system is to avoid the release of pirated apps with various pirated
labels in multiple app markets. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

  abstract = {The emergence of a large number of new malicious code poses a serious
threat to network security, and most of them are derivative versions of
existing malicious code. The classification of malicious code is helpful
to analyze the evolutionary trend of malicious code families and trace
the source of cybercrime. The existing methods of malware classification
emphasize the depth of the neural network, which has the problems of a
long training time and large computational cost. In this work, we
propose the shallow neural network-based malware classifier (SNNMAC), a
malware classification model based on shallow neural networks and static
analysis. Our approach bridges the gap between precise but slow methods
and fast but less precise methods in existing works. For each sample, we
first generate n-grams from their opcode sequences of the binary file
with a decompiler. An improved n-gram algorithm based on control
transfer instructions is designed to reduce the n-gram dataset. Then,
the SNNMAC exploits a shallow neural network, replacing the full
connection layer and softmax with the average pooling layer and
hierarchical softmax, to learn from the dataset and perform
classification. We perform experiments on the Microsoft malware dataset.
The evaluation result shows that the SNNMAC outperforms most of the
related works with 99.21\% classification precision and reduces the
training time by more than half when compared with the methods using DNN
(Deep Neural Networks).},

  abstract = {Batik is a traditional handicraft of ethnic minorities in southwestern
China's Guizhou province. It carries distinctive features, and inherits
profound artistic and cultural values. However, the empirical design
model of batik patterns is not fast or diverse enough to meet the highly
personalized market demands. Moreover, it is difficult to parametrize
the complex ethnic patterns with mathematical models. Hence, the design
of batik patterns cannot satisfy the visual cognitive needs of
consumers, which are constantly changing, fuzzy, and personalized. In
other words, the visual cognitive needs of consumers have not been fully
considered in the parametrization and design of batik patterns. To solve
the problem, this paper puts forward a generative design method for
batik patterns based on shape grammar, and relies on the artificial
neural network (ANN) to model the nonlinear mapping between design
parameters and visual cognitive image (VCI) values. The three-layer ANN
model was optimized with the genetic algorithm (GA) to generate new
patterns, and optimize the composition of their VCIs. The workflow and
effectiveness of the proposed method were explained and verified through
experiments on the generative design of bronze drum patterns, which have
rich ethnic and religious connotations. The experimental results show
that our method can predict the VCI values of the composition, provide
the optimal parameter solution of the VCI values, and decompile the
conceptual prototype from the pattern composition that best meets the
visual cognitive needs of consumers. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

  abstract = {The protection and privacy of the 5G-IoT framework is a major challenge
due to the vast number of mobile devices. Specialized applications
running these 5G-IoT systems may be vulnerable to clone attacks. Cloning
applications can be achieved by stealing or distributing commercial
Android apps to harm the advanced services of the 5G-IoT framework.
Meanwhile, most Android app stores run and manage Android apps that
developers have submitted separately without any central verification
systems. Android scammers sell pirated versions of commercial software
to other app stores under different names. Android applications are
typically stored on cloud servers, while API access services may be used
to detect and prevent cloned applications from being released. In this
paper, we proposed a hybrid approach to the Control Flow Graph (CFG) and
a deep learning model to secure the smart services of the 5G-IoT
framework. First, the newly submitted APK file is extracted and the JDEX
decompiler is used to retrieve Java source files from possibly original
and cloned applications. Second, the source files are broken down into
various android-based components. After generating Control-Flow Graphs
(CFGs), the weighted features are stripped from each component. Finally,
the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is designed to predict potential
cloned applications by training features from different components of
android applications. Experimental results have shown that the proposed
approach can achieve an average accuracy of 96.24\% for cloned
applications selected from different android application stores.},

  abstract = {The openness of Android operating system not only brings convenience to
users, but also leads to the attack threat from a large number of
malicious applications (apps). Thus malware detection has become the
research focus in the field of mobile security. In order to solve the
problem of more coarse-grained feature selection and larger feature loss
of graph structure existing in the current detection methods, we put
forward a method named DGCNDroid for Android malware detection, which is
based on the deep graph convolutional network. Our method starts by
generating a function call graph for the decompiled Android application.
Then the function call subgraph containing the sensitive application
programming interface (API) is extracted. Finally, the function call
subgraphs with structural features are trained as the input of the deep
graph convolutional network. Thus the detection and classification of
malicious apps can be realized. Through experimentation on a dataset
containing 11,120 Android apps, the method proposed in this paper can
achieve detection accuracy of 98.2\%, which is higher than other
existing detection methods.},

  abstract = {Firewalls are essential for managing and protecting computer networks.
They permit specifying which packets are allowed to enter a network, and
also how these packets are modified by IP address translation and port
redirection. Configuring a firewall is notoriously hard, and one of the
reasons is that it requires using low level, hard to interpret,
configuration languages. Equally difficult are policy maintenance and
refactoring, as well as porting a configuration from one firewall system
to another.
To address these issues we introduce a pipeline that assists system
administrators in checking if: (i) the intended security policy is
actually implemented by a configuration; (ii) two configurations are
equivalent; (iii) updates have the desired effect on the firewall
behavior; (iv) there are useless or redundant rules; additionally, an
administrator can (v) transcompile a configuration into an equivalent
one in a different language; and (vi) maintain a configuration using a
generic, declarative language that can be compiled into different target
languages.
The pipeline is based on IFCL, an intermediate firewall language
equipped with a formal semantics, and it is implemented in an open
source tool called FWS. In particular, the first stage decompiles real
firewall configurations for iptables, ipfw, pf and (a subset of) Cisco
IOS into IFCL. The second one transforms an IFCL configuration into a
logical predicate and uses the Z3 solver to synthesize an abstract
specification that succinctly represents the firewall behavior. System
administrators can use FWS to analyze the firewall by posing SQL-like
queries, and update the configuration to meet the desired security
requirements. Finally, the last stage allows for maintaining a
configuration by acting directly on its abstract specification and then
compiling it to the chosen target language. Tests on real firewall
configurations show that FWS can be fruitfully used in real-world
scenarios.},

  abstract = {Popularity and openness have made the Android platform a potential
target of malware attacks. The hackers continuously evolve and improve
attacking strategies to identify vulnerabilities in newer Android
versions. Detection and analysis of malware attacks in Android platform
pose unique challenges due to the security restrictions and resource
limitations present in these devices. This paper proposes a new
behavioural method for Android malware detection and classification. In
the proposed approach, the Android malware dataset is decompiled to
identify the suspicious API classes/methods and generated an encoded
list. The multiple sequence alignment for different malware families is
created using the encoded patterns and it is further applied to generate
profile hidden Markov model. The model classifies an unknown application
as benign or malicious based on the log likelihood score generated. The
framework provides an accuracy of 94.5\%, which is relatively higher
compared to existing similar frameworks for detection of android
malware. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Control flow-based feature extraction method has the ability to detect
malicious code with higher accuracy than traditional text-based methods.
Unfortunately, this method has been encountered with the NP-hard
problem, which is infeasible for the large-sized and high-complexity
programs. To tackle this, we propose a control flow-based feature
extraction dynamic programming algorithm for fast extraction of control
flow-based features with polynomial time O(N-2), where N is the number
of basic blocks in decompiled executable codes. From the experimental
results, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is more
efficient and effective in detecting malware than the existing ones.
Applying our algorithm to an Internet of Things dataset gives better
results on three measures: Accuracy = 99.05\%, False Positive Rate =
1.31\% and False Negative Rate = 0.66\%.},

  abstract = {As mobile phone is widely used in social network communication, it
attracts numerous malicious attacks, which seriously threaten users'
personal privacy and data security. To improve the resilience to attack
technologies, structural information analysis has been widely applied in
mobile malware detection. However, the rapid improvement of mobile
applications has brought an impressive growth of their internal
structure in scale and attack technologies. It makes the timely analysis
of structural information and malicious feature generation a heavy
burden. In this paper, we propose a new Android malware identification
approach based on malicious subgraph mining to improve the detection
performance of large-scale graph structure analysis. Firstly, function
call graphs (FCGs), sensitive permissions, and application programming
interfaces (APIs) are generated from the decompiled files of malware.
Secondly, two kinds of malicious subgraphs are generated from malware's
decompiled files and put into the feature set. At last, test
applications' safety can be automatically identified and classified into
malware families by matching their FCGs with malicious structural
features. To evaluate our approach, a dataset of 11,520 malware and
benign applications is established. Experimental results indicate that
our approach has better performance than three previous works and

  abstract = {Callbacks are an effective programming discipline for implementing
event-driven programming, especially in environments like Ethereum which
forbid shared global state and concurrency. Callbacks allow a callee to
delegate the execution back to the caller. Though effective, they can
lead to subtle mistakes principally in open environments where callbacks
can be added in a new code. Indeed, several high profile bugs in smart
contracts exploit callbacks. We present the first static technique
ensuring modularity in the presence of callbacks and apply it to verify
prominent smart contracts. Modularity ensures that external calls to
other contracts cannot affect the behavior of the contract. Importantly,
modularity is guaranteed without restricting programming.
In general, checking modularity is undecidable -even for programs
without loops. This paper describes an effective technique for soundly
ensuring modularity harnessing SMT solvers. The main idea is to define a
constructive version of modularity using commutativity and projection
operations on program segments. We believe that this approach is also
accessible to programmers, since counterexamples to modularity can be
generated automatically by the SMT solvers, allowing programmers to
understand and fix the error.
We implemented our approach in order to demonstrate the precision of the
modularity analysis and applied it to real smart contracts, including a
subset of the 150 most active contracts in Ethereum. Our implementation
decompiles bytecode programs into an intermediate representation and
then implements the modularity checking using SMT queries. Overall, we
argue that our experimental results indicate that the method can be
applied to many realistic contracts, and that it is able to prove
modularity where other methods fail.},

  abstract = {The malicious APK (Android Application Package) makers use some
techniques such as code obfuscation and code encryption to avoid
existing detection methods, which poses new challenges for accurate
virus detection and makes it more and more difficult to detect the
malicious code. A report indicates that a new malicious app for Android
is created every 10 seconds. To combat this serious malware activity, a
scalable malware detection approach is needed, which can effectively and
efficiently identify the malware apps. Common static detection methods
often rely on Hash matching and analysis of viruses, which cannot
quickly detect new malicious Android applications and their variants. In
this paper, a malicious Android application detection method is
proposed, which is implemented by the deep network fusion model. The
hybrid model only needs to use the sample training model to achieve high
accuracy in the identification of the malicious applications, which is
more suitable for the detection of the new malicious Android
applications than the existing methods. This method extracts the static
features in the core code of the Android application by decompiling APK
files, then performs code vectorization processing, and uses the deep
learning network for classification and discrimination. Our experiments
with a data set containing 10,170 apps show that the decisions from the
hybrid model can increase the malware detection rate significantly on a
real device, which verifies the superiority of this method in the
detection of malicious codes.},

  abstract = {The Big Code and Mining Software Repositories research lines analyze
large amounts of source code to improve software engineering practices.
Massive codebases are used to train machine learning models aimed at
improving the software development process. One example is
decompilation, where C code and its compiled binaries can be used to
train machine learning models to improve decompilation. However,
obtaining massive codebases of portable C code is not an easy task,
since most applications use particular libraries, operating systems, or
language extensions. In this paper, we present Cnerator, a Python
application that provides the stochastic generation of large amounts of
standard C code. It is highly configurable, allowing the user to specify
the probability distributions of each language construct, properties of
the generated code, and post-processing modifications of the output
programs. Cnerator has been successfully used to generate code that,
utilized to train machine learning models, has improved the performance
of existing decompilers. It has also been used in the implementation of
an infrastructure for the automatic extraction of code patterns. (C)

  abstract = {Many researchers analyze malware through static analysis and dynamic
analysis technology, and combine it with excellent deep learning
algorithm, which has achieved good results in malware classification.
However, many researches only use the. ASM file generated by decompiler
or. Bytes file represented by hexadecimal for feature extraction. This
paper fully integrates the features of these two files, and uses word
frequency and two deep learning algorithms to extract 184 opcode
features and 16 probability features from ASM file and section file of
Kaggle dataset respectively. Then, double byte feature coding method is
used to fuse the features of the two files. Finally, convolution neural
network is used to classify the fused samples. The experimental results
show that the accuracy is 98.68\% and the logarithm loss is 0.022. (C)

  abstract = {Owing to the development of next-generation network and data processing
technologies, massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming
hyperconnected. As a result, Linux malware is being created to attack
such hyperconnected networks by exploiting security threats in IoT
devices. To determine the potential threats of such Linux malware and
respond effectively, malware classification through an analysis of the
executed code is required; however, a limitation exists in that each
heterogeneous architecture must be analyzed separately. However, the
binary codes of a heterogeneous architecture can be translated to a
high-level intermediate representation (IR) of the same format using
binary lifting and malicious behavior information can be identified
because the functions and parameters of the assembly code are stored in
the IR. Consequently, this study suggests a Linux malware classification
method applicable to various architectures by converting Linux assembly
codes into an IR using binary lifting and then learning the IR Sequence
which reflects malicious behavior pattern using deep learning model for
sequence learning.},

  abstract = {More and more Android application developers are adopting many different
methods against reverse engineering, such as adding a shell, resulting
in certain features that cannot be obtained through decompilation, which
causes a serious sample imbalance in Android malware detection based on
machine learning. Hence, the researchers have focused on how to solve
class-imbalance to improve the performance of Android malware detection.
However, the disadvantages of the existing class-imbalance learning are
mainly the loss of valuable samples and the computational cost. In this
paper, we propose a method of Class-Imbalance Learning (CIL), which
first selects representative features, uses the clustering K-Means
algorithm and under-sampling to retain the important samples of the
majority class while reducing the number of samples of the majority
class. After that, we use the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique
(SMOTE) algorithm to generate minority class samples for data balance,
and finally use the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to build a malware
detection model. The result of experiments indicates that CIL
effectively improves the performance of Android malware detection based
on machine learning, especially for class imbalance. Compared with
existing class-imbalance learning methods, CIL is also effective for the
Machine Learning Repository from the University of California, Irvine
(UCI) and has better performance in some data sets.},

  abstract = {Many internet artworks from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s used Adobe
Flash technology for creating animated content. However, in the light of
recent web standard developments (HTML5), Adobe has stopped supporting
Flash and its related tools. The removal of Flash has made those net
artworks non-functional and unviewable, including Sinae Kim's Genesis
(2001), the focus of this study. Recently proposed emulation- and
virtualisation-based strategies are not always suitable, particularly if
there is a desire to keep the artwork on the `live web'. This article
outlines an alternative method of migration facilitated by reverse
engineering techniques-specifically decompilation-and foregrounds the
significance of maintaining online access to the obsolete Adobe
Shockwave Flash (SWF) files through the source code. On this premise,
the source code is re-imagined as a site for further re-enactment,
allowing a departure from its current role as a marker of
`authenticity'.},

  abstract = {Cyberattacks are increasing in both number and severity for private,
corporate, and governmental bodies. To prevent these attacks, many
intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems provide
computer security by monitoring network packets and auditing system
records. However, most of these systems only monitor network packets
rather than the computer itself, so physical intrusion is also an
important security issue. Furthermore, with the rapid progress of the
Internet of Things (IoT) technology, security problems of IoT devices
are also increasing. Many IoT devices can be disassembled for
decompilation, resulting in the theft of sensitive data. To prevent
this, physical intrusion detection systems of the IoT should be
considered. We here propose a physical security system that can protect
data from unauthorized access when the computer chassis is opened or
tampered with. Sensor switches monitor the chassis status at all times
and upload event logs to a cloud server for remote monitoring. If the
system finds that the computer has an abnormal condition, it takes
protective measures and notifies the administrator. This system can be
extended to IoT devices to protect their data from theft.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain greatly benefit from
cutting-edge analysis techniques and pose significant challenges. A
primary challenge is the extremely low-level representation of deployed
contracts. We present Elipmoc, a decompiler for the next generation of
smart contract analyses. Elipmoc is an evolution of Gigahorse, the top
research decompiler, dramatically improving over it and over other
state-of-the-art tools, by employing several high-precision techniques
and making them scalable. Among these techniques are a new kind of
context sensitivity (termed ``transactional sensitivity{''}) that
provides a more effective static abstraction of distinct dynamic
executions; a path-sensitive (yet scalable, through path merging)
algorithm for inference of function arguments and returns; and a fully
context sensitive private function reconstruction process. As a result,
smart contract security analyses and reverse-engineering tools built on
top of Elipmoc achieve high scalability, precision and completeness.
Elipmoc improves over all notable past decompilers, including its
predecessor, Gigahorse, and the stateof-the-art industrial tool,
Panoramix, integrated into the primary Ethereum blockchain explorer,
Etherscan. Elipmoc produces decompiled contracts with fully resolved
operands at a rate of 99.5\% (compared to 62.8\% for Gigahorse), and
achieves much higher completeness in code decornpilation than
Panoramix-e.g., up to 67\% more coverage of external call
statements-while being over 5x faster. Elipmoc has been the enabler for
recent (independent) discoveries of several exploitable vulnerabilities
on popular protocols, over funds in the many millions of dollars.},

  abstract = {Software piracy is an act of illegal stealing and distributing
commercial software either for revenue or identify theft. Pirated
applications on Android app stores are harming developers and their
users by clone scammers. The scammers usually generate pirated versions
of the same applications and publish them in different open-source app
stores. There is no centralized system between these app stores to
prevent scammers from publishing pirated applications. As most of the
app stores are hosted on cloud storage, therefore a cloud-based
interaction system can prevent scammers from publishing pirated
applications. In this paper, we proposed IoT-based cloud architecture
for clone detection using program dependency analysis. First, the newly
submitted APK and possible original files are selected from app stores.
The APK Extractor and JDEX decompiler extract APK and DEX files for Java
source code analysis. The dependency graphs of Java files are generated
to extract a set of weighted features. The Stacked-Long Short-Term
Memory (S-LSTM) deep learning model is designed to predict possible
clones.
Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach can achieve
an average accuracy of 95.48\% among clones from different application
stores.},

  abstract = {Mobile malware is malicious software designed specifically for targeting
various mobile gadgets like tablets, smartphones, and so forth, in which
any type of malicious code affecting the mobile devices without the
knowledge of the user. The increasing number of users encourages the
hacker for generating various malware applications. Therefore, in this
paper, we utilized three vital phases namely the pre-processing process,
Feature extraction process as well as classification process in which
the malicious data are detected. In the pre-processing phase, an
Androguard tool is used for decompiling and disassembling the android
applications. The API call features are extracted in the feature
extraction phase and in the classification phase, long short term memory
based electro search optimization (LSTM-ESO) is employed to detect the
unknown mobile applications as benign or malicious. The malicious mobile
detecting accuracy deals in requesting permission and exhibiting
malicious code applications. In order to enhance the identification of
various malware applications, this paper utilized frequency analysis and
permissions of API calls. Finally, the experimental analysis is
performed by evaluating the performance measures like accuracy,
precision, recall, and F-measure. From the evaluation outcome, it is
observed that the classification accuracy obtained is 97.69\%.},

  abstract = {Malware detection is of great significance for maintaining the security
of information systems. Malware obfuscation techniques and malware
variants are increasingly emerging, but their samples and API
(application programming interface) sequences are difficult to obtain.
This poses difficulties for the development of malware variant detection
models. To address this issue in this paper, we first generated a
malware variant dataset using the obfuscation technique based on the
disassembly and decompilation of malware. Then, an API call dataset of
these malware variants was constructed through sandboxing. Compared to
similar work, the malware variants and their obfuscated API call
sequences generated in this paper were all runnable. After that, taking
a public API call sequence dataset of obfuscation-free malware as input,
a BERT (bidirectional encoder representation from transformers)
pretrained model for malware detection was constructed. To enhance the
ability of this pretrained model to handle obfuscation and variants, in
this paper, we used adversarial training to improve the robustness and
generalization of the detection model under obfuscation. As the
experimental results show, the proposed scheme can improve the
classification performance of malware variants under obfuscation. The
accuracy of the malware variant classification was close to that of the
unobfuscated case.},

  abstract = {Context: Due to the change and advancement in technology, day by day the
internet service usages are also increasing. Smartphones have become the
necessity for every person these days. It is used to perform all basic
daily activities such as calling, SMS, banking, gaming, entertainment,
education, etc. Therefore, malware authors are developing new variants
of malwares or malicious applications especially for monetary benefits.
Objective: Objective of this research paper is to develop a technique
that can be used to detect malwares or malicious applications on the
android devices that will work for all types of packed or encrypted
malicious applications, which usually evade decompiling tools.
Method: In the proposed approach, visualization method is used for the
detection of malware. In the first phase, application files are
converted into images and then in second phase, texture feature of
images are extracted using Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM). In
the last phase, machine learning classification algorithms are used to
classify the malicious and benign applications.
Results: The proposed approach is rim on different datasets collected
from various repositories. Different efficiency parameters are
calculated and the proposed approach is compared with the existing
approaches.
Conclusion: We have proposed a static technique for efficient detection
of malwares. The proposed technique performs better than the existing
technique.},

  abstract = {Due to the open-source and versatility of the Android operating system,
Android malware has exploded, and the malware detection of Android IoT
devices has become a research hotspot in recent years. Static analysis
technology cannot effectively analyze obfuscated malware. Without
decomposing, the existing detection methods are mainly based on
grayscale images and single files without analyzing and verifying their
anti-obfuscation performance. In addition, the current detection of
Android malware using deep learning is concentrated in the field of
binary classification. This paper proposes a multi-classification method
of the Android malware family based on multi-class feature files and RGB
images to solve these problems. The method proposed in this paper does
not need to decompile the Android APK installation package. However, it
extracts the DEX file and XML file in batch from the APK installation
package. Then, it converts the file into an RGB image using the
conversion algorithm that converts Android software into images.
Finally, the deep neural network automatically obtains the RGB image
texture features to realize the multiple classifications of the Android
malware family. Experimental data show that the proposed method has high
detection performance, and the accuracy of multiple classifications of
the Android malware family is as high as 99.84\%. In addition, the
method based on RGB image is better than the gray-scale image in
detection accuracy, and the effect of RGB image combined with DEX and
XML is better than that of separate DEX file image and separate XML file
image. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can effectively
detect the obfuscated Android malware, and the detection accuracy of
99.23\% can be achieved for the obfuscated sample data. Furthermore,
this method has good anti-obfuscation ability. The proposed method is
compared with those based on Multi-Layer Perceptron, Long Short-Term
Memory, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Deep Belief Network.
The experimental results show the proposed method's effectiveness and
high generalization performance.},

  abstract = {The arrival of the Bourbons to the Hispanic Monarchy brought with it new
ways of conceiving of the society attached to its body politic. New laws
and rights were promoted, which motivated among the free population a
recognition of their status and states in the space of the localities of
Hispanic America. In this sense, the present work attempts to approach
the case of the integration and recognition of the free population of
the city of Caloto, And the contiguous seat of Quilichao. The analysis
of the census carried out in the year 1784 in Caloto and of the
decompiled documentation of the General Archive of the Nation, from the
colony section (Cauca populations) allows the observation and
identification that in the framework of the interwoven relationships of
the free or mestizo population there were some activities that
influenced incorporation and the forms of participation in the
community.},

  abstract = {Centrally controlled energy conversion schemes in intelligent
residential microgrids are a difficult optimization challenge because of
their range of processing and power devices accessible. Typical steps to
shrink the weight and seriousness of the issues are decreasing modelling
precision, adding several weights, or adjusting the measurement
accuracy. Nevertheless, because these interventions modify the
specialization issue and thus result in various approaches as expected,
this article introduces a Bigdata assisted energy conversion model
(BD-ECM) and evaluates a decomposition approach to solve the initial
problem recursively. Compared to the initial compact version, the
decayed approach is tested to demonstrate that all versions differ less
than 18.8\%. Moreover, both methods contribute to the use of roughly
similar structures. The results reveal that because of the existing
constraints on computational capital and simulation techniques,
condensed development of the common law can only be extended to moderate
and limited intelligent grids. However, decentralized approaches can be
dealing with sizeable dispersed generation structures. To assess the
month's environmental and strategic advantages as part of the system,
researchers extend the decompiled approach to a massive smart grid. The
data reveal that prices can be lowered by 14.0\% in local energy
exchanges and pollution by 23.9\% in the situation studied.},

  abstract = {Much software, whether beneficent or malevolent, is distributed only as
binaries, sans source code. Absent source code, understanding binaries'
behavior can be quite challenging, especially when compiled under higher
levels of compiler optimization. These optimizations can transform
comprehensible, ``natural{''} source constructions into something
entirely unrecognizable. Reverse engineering binaries, especially those
suspected of being malevolent or guilty of intellectual property theft,
are important and time-consuming tasks. There is a great deal of
interest in tools to ``decompile{''} binaries back into more natural
source code to aid reverse engineering. Decompilation involves several
desirable steps, including recreating source-language constructions,
variable names, and perhaps even comments. One central step in creating
binaries is optimizing function calls, using steps such as inlining.
Recovering these (possibly inlined) function calls from optimized
binaries is an essential task that most state-of-the-art decompiler
tools try to do but do not perform very well. In this paper, we evaluate
a supervised learning approach to the problem of recovering optimized
function calls. We leverage open-source software and develop an
automated labeling scheme to generate a reasonably large dataset of
binaries labeled with actual function usages. We augment this large but
limited labeled dataset with a pre-training step, which learns the
decompiled code statistics from a much larger unlabeled dataset. Thus
augmented, our learned labeling model can be combined with an existing
decompilation tool, Ghidra, to achieve substantially improved
performance in function call recovery, especially at higher levels of
optimization.},

  abstract = {Aiming at the problems of coupling between transformer input
characteristics and low accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, SSA-MDS
and other soft technologies are used to analyze the key characteristics
of transformer faults, so as to improve the accuracy of transformer
fault diagnosis. The SSA algorithm cascade MDS algorithm to process the
DGA data is proposed. Subsequently, the TSSA-RF model is introduced to
classify the DGA data. The DGA data is first mapped to a
high-dimensional space. Next, the optimal feature subset is encoded
using the SSA algorithm to reduce irrelevant and redundant features. In
this study, the correlation between the optimal feature dimension and
the transformer fault diagnosis accuracy is investigated. the expression
of the optimal feature subset is obtained by decompiling the SSA
operator. The pre-processed data are classified using the RF model, and
the TSSA -RF model for classifying the DGA data is found with the
highest accuracy through the comparison of different optimization
algorithms. After the RF model is optimized using the TSSA algorithm,
its accuracy increases by 7.89\%, and the accuracy of the TSSA -RF model
is obtained as 92.11\%. The example results show that compared with the
original data, the proposed data processing algorithm improves the
diagnostic accuracy of transformer by 11.97 \% in the RF model. Compared
with multiple preprocessing methods, SSA-MDS has the highest accuracy.
Compared with the original data, the accuracy of TSSA-RF model increases
by 11.64 \%.},

  abstract = {With society's increasing reliance on computer systems and network
technology, the threat of malicious software grows more and more
serious. In the field of information security, malware detection has
been a key problem that academia and industry are committed to solving.
Machine learning is an effective method for processing large-scale data,
such as the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and deep neural
network technology. Although these types of detection methods can deal
with cyber threats, most feature extraction methods are based on the
statistical information features of portable executable (PE) files and
thus lack the decompiled code and execution flow structure of the PE
samples. Therefore, we propose a Control-Flow Graph (CFG)- and Graph
Isomorphism Network (GIN)-based malware classification system. The
feature vectors of CFG basic blocks are generated using the large-scale
pre-trained language model MiniLM, which is beneficial for the GIN to
further learn and compress the CFG-based representation, and classified
with multi-layer perceptron. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness
of the representation under different dimensions and classifiers. To
evaluate our method, we set up a CFG-based malware detection graph
dataset from a PE file of the Blue Hexagon Open Dataset for Malware
Analysis (BODMAS), which we call the Malware Geometric Binary Dataset
(MGD-BINARY) and collected the experimental results of CFG
representation in different dimensions and classifier settings. The
evaluation results show that our proposal has proved an Accuracy metric
of 0.99160 and achieved 0.99148 Area Under the Curve (AUC) results.},

  abstract = {Malware detection is an important task in software maintenance. It can
effectively protect user information from the attack of malicious
developers. Existing studies mainly focus on leveraging permission
information and API call information to identify malware. However, many
studies pay attention to the API call without considering the role of
API call sequences. In this study, we propose a new method by combining
both the permission information and the API call sequence information to
distinguish malicious applications from benign applications. First, we
extract features of permission and API call sequence with a decompiling
tool. Then, one-hot encoding and Word2Vec are adopted to represent the
permission feature and the API call sequence feature for each
application, respectively. Based on this, we leverage Random Forest (RF)
and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a permission-based
classifier and an API call sequence-based classifier, respectively.
Finally, we design a linear strategy to combine the outputs of these two
classifiers to predict the labels of newly arrived applications. By an
evaluation with 15,198 malicious applications and 15,129 benign
applications, our approach achieves 98.84\% in terms of precision,
98.17\% in terms of recall, 98.50\% in terms of F1-score, and 98.52\% in
terms of accuracy on average, and outperforms the state-of-art method
Malscan by 2.12\%, 0.27\%, 1.20\%, and 1.24\%, respectively. In
addition, we demonstrate that the method combining two features achieves
better performance than the methods based on a single feature.},

  abstract = {Static detection of security vulnerabilities in binary programs is an
important research field in software supply chain security. However,
existing vulnerability detection methods based on code similarity can
only detect known vulnerabilities. Vulnerability features generated by
vulnerability pattern-based detec-tion methods are low robust due to the
influence of manually defined patterns, compiler diversity, and
irrelevant function instructions. In this paper, we propose BinVulDet,
which is a binary level vulnerability detection tool for accurate known
and unknown vulnerability detection. BinVulDet uses decompilation
techniques to obtain pseudo code containing high-level semantic
information against the impact of com-pilation diversity. Then the
program slicing technique is used to extract the statements with data
depen-dencies and control dependencies related to the vulnerability. A
BiLSTM-attention neural network is used to extract rich contextual
semantic information from slice codes to generate more robust
vulnerability patterns to detect vulnerabilities. The experimental
results show that BinVulDet outperforms the state-of-the-art binary
vulnerability detection methods. The FPR and FNR of BinVulDet are 1.04\%
and 0.89\% on average, respectively, which are 3.93\% and 22.86\% lower
than the baseline model on average. BinVulDet can effectively against
the influence of compilation diversity and successfully be used for
real-world vul-nerability detection by being evaluated in three CVE
vulnerability projects.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Decompilers are indispensable tools in Android malware analysis and app
security auditing. Numerous academic works also employ an Android
decompiler as the first step in a program analysis pipeline. In such
settings, decompilation is frequently regarded as a ``solved{''}
problem, in that it is simply expected that source code can be
accurately recovered from an app. On the other hand, it is known that,
e.g, obfuscation can negatively impact a decompiler's effectiveness.
Therefore, in order to better understand potential failure modes of,
e.g., automated analysis pipelines involving decompilation, it is
important to characterize the performance of decompilers on both benign
and malicious apps. To this end, we have performed what is, to the best
of our knowledge, the first large-scale study of Android decompilation
failure rates, using three sets of apps; namely, 3,018 open-source apps,
13,601 apps crawled from Google Play, and an existing collection of
24,553 malware samples. In addition to the state-of-the-art Dalvik
bytecode decompiler Jadx, we also studied the performance of three
popular Java decompilers. Furthermore, this paper also presents the
findings from a follow-up study on 54,945 malware apps, where we
additionally performed an analysis of the reasons for decompilation
failures. Our study revealed that decompilers generally have very low
failure rates, and that few failures on benign apps appear to be related
to obfuscation. On malware, however, obfuscation appears to be a more
prominent cause of failures, although the vast majority of malicious
apps could still be fully decompiled by an ensemble of decompilers.},

generate a function call graph (FCG), and extract the sensitive function
call graph (SFCG) on the FCG. Secondly, we extract two class features
(1) use the Skip-gram model to obtain function embeddings, and (2) treat
the SFCG as a social network and extract the triads attribute of the
sensitive API. The two types of features are combined as a feature
representation of the SFCG and fed into a graph convolutional network
(GCN) for malware detection. For experiments on 26,939 Android software
datasets, SFCGDroid in this paper can achieve 98.22\% accuracy and

  abstract = {Smart contracts have been widely used in the blockchain world these
years, and simultaneously vulner-ability detection has gained more and
more attention due to the staggering economic losses caused by the
attacker. Existing tools that analyze vulnerabilities for smart
contracts heavily rely on rules predefined by experts, which are
labour-intense and require domain knowledge. Moreover, predefined rules
tend to be misconceptions and increase the risk of crafty potential
back-doors in the future. Recently, researchers mainly used static and
dynamic execution analysis to detect the vulnerabilities of smart
contracts and have achieved acceptable results. However, the dynamic
method cannot cover all the program inputs and execution paths, which
leads to some vulnerabilities that are hard to detect. The static
analysis method commonly includes symbolic execution and theorem
proving, which requires using constraints to detect vulnerability. These
shortcomings show that traditional methods are challenging to apply and
expand on a large scale. This paper aims to detect vulnerabilities via
the Bug Injection framework and transfer learning techniques. First, we
train a Transformer encoder using multi-modality code, which contains
source code, intermediate representation, and assembly code. The input
code consists separately of Solidity source code, intermediate
representation, and assembly code. Specifically, we translate source
code into the intermediate representation and decompile the byte code
into assembly code by the EVM compiler. Then, we propose a novel entropy
embedding technique, which combines token embedding, segment embedding,
and positional embedding of the Transformer encoder in our approach.
After that, we utilize the Bug Injection framework to automatically
generate specific types of buggy code for fine-tuning and evaluating the
performance of vulnerability detection. The experimental results show
that our proposed approach improves the performance in detecting
reentrancy vulnerabilities and timestamp dependence. Moreover, our
approach is more flexible and scalable than static and dynamic analysis
approaches in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. Our approach
improves the baseline approaches by an average of 11.89\% in term of F1

  abstract = {JNI programs are widely used thanks to the combined benefits of C and
Java programs. However, because understanding the interaction behaviors
between two different programming languages is challenging, JNI program
development is difficult to get right and vulnerable to security
attacks. Thus, researchers have proposed static analysis of JNI program
source code to detect bugs and security vulnerabilities in JNI programs.
Unfortunately, such source code analysis is not applicable to compiled
JNI programs that are not open-sourced or open-source JNI programs
containing third-party binary libraries. While JN-SAF, the
state-of-the-art analyzer for compiled JNI programs, can analyze binary
code, it has several limitations due to its symbolic execution and
summary-based bottom-up analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to statically analyze compiled JNI programs without their
source code using binary decompilation. Unlike JN-SAF that analyzes
binaries directly, our approach decompiles binaries and analyzes JNI
programs with the decompiled binaries using an existing JNI program
analyzer for source code. To decompile binaries to compilable C source
code with precise JNI-interoperation-related types, we improve an
existing decompilation tool by leveraging the characteristics of JNI
programs. Our evaluation shows that the approach is precise as almost
the same as the state-of-the-art JNI program analyzer for source code,
and more precise than JN-SAF.},

  abstract = {This paper provides a systematic analysis of existing resource
platforms, evaluating their advantages and drawbacks with respect to
data privacy protection. To address the privacy and security risks
associated with resource platform data, we propose a novel privacy
protection algorithm based on chunking disorder. Our algorithm exchanges
data within a specific range of chunk size for the position and combines
the chunked data with the MD5 value in a differential way, thus ensuring
data privacy. To ensure the security of the algorithm, we also discuss
the importance of preventing client and server decompilation during its
implementation. The findings of our experiments are as follows. Our
proposed privacy-preserving algorithm is extremely secure and easy to
implement. Our algorithm has a significant avalanche effect, maintaining
values of 0.61-0.85, with information entropy being maintained at
4.5-4.9. This indicates that our algorithm is highly efficient without
compromising data security. Furthermore, our algorithm has strong
encryption and decryption time stability. The key length can be up to
594 bits, rendering it challenging to decrypt. Compared with the
traditional DES algorithm, our algorithm has better security under the
same conditions and approaches the levels of security offered by the AES
and RC4 algorithms.},

  abstract = {The massive number of open-source projects in public repositories has
notably increased in the last years. Such repositories represent
valuable information to be mined for different purposes, such as
documenting recurrent syntactic constructs, analyzing the particular
constructs used by experts and beginners, using them to teach
programming and to detect bad programming practices, and building
programming tools such as decompilers, Integrated Development
Environments or Intelligent Tutoring Systems. An inherent problem of
source code is that its syntactic information is represented with tree
structures, while traditional machine learning algorithms use
n-dimensional datasets. Therefore, we present a feature engineering
process to translate tree structures into homogeneous and heterogeneous
n-dimensional datasets to be mined. Then, we run different interpretable
(supervised and unsupervised) machine learning algorithms to mine the
syntactic information of more than 17 million syntactic constructs in
Java code. The results reveal interesting information such as the Java
constructs that are barely (and widely) used (e.g., bitwise operators,
union types and static blocks), different language features and patterns
mostly (and barely) used by beginners (and experts), the discovery of
particular types of source code (e.g., helper or utility classes, data
transfer objects and too complex abstractions), and how complexity is an
inherent characteristic in some clusters of syntactic constructs.},

  abstract = {The smartphone has become an indispensable tool in our daily lives, and
the Android operating system is widely installed on our smartphones.
This makes Android smartphones a prime target for malware. In order to
address threats posed by malware, many researchers have proposed
different malware detection approaches, including using a function call
graph (FCG). Although an FCG can capture the complete call-callee
semantic relationship of a function, it will be represented as a huge
graph structure. The presence of many nonsensical nodes affects the
detection efficiency. At the same time, the characteristics of the graph
neural networks (GNNs) make the important node features in the FCG tend
toward similar nonsensical node features during the propagation process.
In our work, we propose an Android malware detection approach to enhance
node feature differences in an FCG. Firstly, we propose an API-based
node feature by which we can visually analyze the behavioral properties
of different functions in the app and determine whether their behavior
is benign or malicious. Then, we extract the FCG and the features of
each function from the decompiled APK file. Next, we calculate the API
coefficient inspired by the idea of the TF-IDF algorithm and extract the
sensitive function called subgraph (S-FCSG) based on API coefficient
ranking. Finally, before feeding the S-FCSG and node features into the
GCN model, we add the self-loop for each node of the S-FCSG. A 1-D
convolutional neural network and fully connected layers are used for
further feature extraction and classification, respectively. The
experimental result shows that our approach enhances the node feature
differences in an FCG, and the detection accuracy is greater than that
of models using other features, suggesting that malware detection based
on a graph structure and GNNs has a lot of space for future study.},

  abstract = {We introduce the new problem of hardware decompilation. Analogous to
software decompilation, hardware decompilation is about analyzing a
low-level artifact-in this case a netlist, i.e., a graph of wires and
logical gates representing a digital circuit-in order to recover
higher-level programming abstractions, and using those abstractions to
generate code written in a hardware description language (HDL). The
overall problem of hardware decompilation requires a number of pieces.
In this paper we focus on one specific piece of the puzzle: a technique
we call hardware loop rerolling. Hardware loop rerolling leverages clone
detection and program synthesis techniques to identify repeated logic in
netlists (such as would be synthesized from loops in the original HDL
code) and reroll them into syntactic loops in the recovered HDL code. We
evaluate hardware loop rerolling for hardware decompilation over a set
of hardware design benchmarks written in the PyRTL HDL and industry
standard SystemVerilog. Our implementation identifies and rerolls loops
in 52 out of 53 of the netlists in our benchmark suite, and we show
three examples of how hardware decompilation can provide concrete
benefits: transpilation between HDLs, faster simulation times over
netlists (with mean speedup of 6x), and artifact compaction (39\%
smaller on average).},

  abstract = {Energy efficiency is a non-functional requirement that developers must
consider, particularly when building software for battery-operated
devices like mobile ones: a long-lasting battery is an essential
requirement for an enjoyable user experience.In previous studies, it has
been shown that many mobile applications include inefficiencies that
cause battery to be drained faster than necessary. Some of these
inefficiencies result from software patterns that have been catalogued,
and for which more energy-efficient alternatives are also known.The
existing catalogues, however, assume as a fundamental requirement that
one has access to the source code of an application in order to be able
to analyse it. This requirement makes independent energy analysis
challenging, or even impossible, e.g. for a mobile user or, most
significantly, an App Store trying to provide information on how
efficient an application being submitted for publication is.We study the
viability of looking for known energy patterns in applications by
decompiling them and analysing the resulting code. For this, we
decompiled and analysed 420 open-source applications by extending an
existing tool, which is now capable of transparently decompiling and
analysing android applications. With the collected data, we performed a
comparative study of the presence of four energy patterns between the
source code and the decompiled code.We performed two types of analysis:
(i) comparing the total number of energy pattern detections; (ii)
comparing the similarity between energy pattern detections. When
comparing the total number of detections in source code against
decompiled code, we found that 79.29\% of the applications reported the
same number of energy pattern detections.To test the similarity between
source code and APKs, we calculated, for each application, a similarity
score based on our four implemented detectors. Of all applications,
35.76\% achieved a perfect similarity score of 4, and 89.40\% got a
score of 3 or more out of 4. Furthermore, only two applications got a
score of 0.When viewed in tandem, the results of the two analyses we
performed point in a promising direction. They provide initial evidence
that static analysis techniques, typically used in source code, can be a
viable method to inspect APKs when access to source code is restricted,
and further research in this area is worthwhile.},

  abstract = {Android has been a constant target of cybercriminals that try to attack
one of the most used operating systems, commonly using malicious
applications (denominated malware) that, once installed on a device, can
harm users in several ways. Existing malware detection solutions are
usually invasive as they obtain classification features by performing
reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of the analyzed
application, which infringes licenses and terms of use of applications.
In addition, these solutions often employ a single machine learning (ML)
model to detect various types of malware, resulting in several false
alarms. In this context, we propose an approach to detect Android
malware consisting of a set of specific-type detectors in which each one
performs a multi-stage analysis, based on rules and ML techniques, in
different phases of the application cycle (before and after its
installation). Our approach also differs from state-of-the-art solutions
by being non-invasive, since it leverages a process to obtain
application's features that does not infringe licenses and terms of use
of applications. In addition, according to experiments performed on a
real Android smartphone, our proposal presents the following additional
advantages over state-of-the-art solutions: a more efficient process to
classify applications that is three times faster and requires ten times
less CPU usage in some cases (saving device energy); and a better
detection performance, with higher balanced accuracy, nine times less
false positive cases, and ten times less false negative cases.},

  abstract = {With the rising prominence of smart contracts, security attacks
targeting them have increased, posing severe threats to their security
and intellectual property rights. Existing simplistic datasets hinder
effective vulnerability detection, raising security concerns. To address
these challenges, we propose BiAn, a source code level smart contract
obfuscation method that generates complex vulnerability test datasets.
BiAn protects contracts by obfuscating data flows, control flows, and
code layouts, increasing complexity and making it harder for attackers
to discover vulnerabilities. Our experiments with buggy contracts showed
an average complexity enhancement of approximately 174\% after
obfuscation. Decompilers Vandal and Gigahorse had total failure rate
increments of 38.8\% and 40.5\% respectively. Obfuscated contracts also
decreased vulnerability detection rates in more than 50\% of cases for
ten widely-used static analysis detection tools.},

  abstract = {Most of the time, cybercriminals look for new ways to bypass security
controls by improving their attacks. In the 1980s, attackers developed
malware to kidnap user data by requesting payments. Malware is called a
ransomware. Recently, they have demanded payment in Bitcoin or any other
cryptocurrency. Ransomware is one of the most dangerous threats on the
Internet, and this type of malware could affect almost all devices.
Malware cipher device data, making them inaccessible to users. In this
study, a new method for Android ransomware classification was proposed.
This method implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for malware
classification based on images. This paper presents a novel method for
transforming an Android Application Package (APK) into a grayscale
image. The image creation relies on using Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques for text cleaning and Fuzzy Hashing to represent the
decompiled code from the APK in a set of hashes after preprocessing
using NLP techniques. The image is composed of n fuzzy hashes that
represent the APK. The method was tested using a dataset of 7,765
Android ransomware samples obtained from external researchers and public
sources. The accuracy of the proposed method was higher than that of
other methods in the literature.},

  abstract = {Familiar analysis for malware plays an important role in comprehending
the diversity of malicious behaviors and identifying the emerging
security threats. Existing studies mainly focus on classifying malware
into known families by supervised learning. However, these methods face
two main challenges, 1) the lack of a large amount of labeled data and
2) the poor effectiveness in identifying unknown families of malware. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called multiple
features (MulFC) based on unsupervised learning. In the method, we first
leverage a decompiling tool to extract multiple features, including
manifest features, application programming interface (API) features, and
opcode features. Then, the opcode features are preprocessed to filter
out the redundant ones to reduce the calculation cost. After that, we
adopt the Jaccard index to calculate the similarities between malware
and construct a malware network. Finally, InfoMap is applied to perform
the clustering on the basis of the malware network. Overall, MulFC does
not require the use of labeled data and can identify unknown families of
malware. Experiments are conducted on two datasets for the performance
evaluation of MulFC. The experimental results show that MulFC achieves
0.810 in terms of normalized mutual information, 0.576 in terms of
adjusted rand index, 0.620 in terms of the Fowlkes-Mallows index, and
0.805 in terms of V-measure on average, and outperforms the
state-of-the-art baseline method by 0.060, 0.054, 0.038, and 0.065,
respectively.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of Android-based devices has brought about an
unprecedented surge in mobile application usage, making the Android
ecosystem a prime target for cybercriminals. In this paper, a new method
for Android malware classification is proposed. The method implements a
convolutional neural network for malware classification using images.
The research presents a novel approach to transforming the Android
Application Package (APK) into a grayscale image. The image creation
utilizes natural language processing techniques for text cleaning,
extraction, and fuzzy hashing to represent the decompiled code from the
APK in a set of hashes after preprocessing, where the image is composed
of n fuzzy hashes that represent an APK. The method was tested on an
Android malware dataset with 15,493 samples of five malware types. The
proposed method showed an increase in accuracy compared to others in the
literature, achieving up to 98.24\% in the classification task.},

  abstract = {Food chemicals have a fundamental role in our lives, with an extended
impact on nutrition, disease prevention, and marked economic
implications in the food industry. The number of food chemical compounds
in public databases has substantially increased in the past few years,
which can be characterized using chemoinformatics approaches. We and
other groups explored public food chemical libraries containing up to
26,500 compounds. This study aimed to analyze the chemical contents,
diversity, and coverage in the chemical space of food chemicals and
additives and, from here on, food components. The approach to food
components addressed in this study is a public database with more than
70,000 compounds, including those predicted via omics techniques. It was
concluded that food components have distinctive physicochemical
properties and constitutional descriptors despite sharing many chemical
structures with natural products. Food components, on average, have
large molecular weights and several apolar structures with saturated
hydrocarbons. Compared to reference databases, food component structures
have low scaffold and fingerprint-based diversity and high structural
complexity, as measured by the fraction of sp3 carbons. These structural
features are associated with a large fraction of macronutrients as
lipids. Lipids in food components were decompiled by an analysis of the
maximum common substructures. The chemical multiverse representation of
food chemicals showed a larger coverage of chemical space than natural
products and FDA-approved drugs by using different sets of
representations.},

  abstract = {From logical reasoning to mental simulation, biological and artificial
neural systems possess an incredible capacity for computation. Such
neural computers offer a fundamentally novel computing paradigm by
representing data continuously and processing information in a natively
parallel and distributed manner. To harness this computation, prior work
has developed extensive training techniques to understand existing
neural networks. However, the lack of a concrete and low-level machine
code for neural networks precludes us from taking full advantage of a
neural computing framework. Here we provide such a machine code along
with a programming framework by using a recurrent neural network-a
reservoir computer-to decompile, code and compile analogue computations.
By decompiling the reservoir's internal representation and dynamics into
an analytic basis of its inputs, we define a low-level neural machine
code that we use to program the reservoir to solve complex equations and
store chaotic dynamical systems as random-access memory. We further
provide a fully distributed neural implementation of software
virtualization and logical circuits, and even program a playable game of
pong inside of a reservoir computer. Importantly, all of these functions
are programmed without requiring any example data or sampling of state
space. Finally, we demonstrate that we can accurately decompile the
analytic, internal representations of a full-rank reservoir computer
that has been conventionally trained using data. Taken together, we
define an implementation of neural computation that can both decompile
computations from existing neural connectivity and compile distributed
programs as new connections.},

  abstract = {Java bytecode is a quite high-level language and, as such, it is fairly
easy to analyze and decompile with malicious intents, e.g., to tamper
with code and skip license checks. Code obfuscation was a first attempt
to mitigate malicious reverse-engineering based on static analysis.
However, obfuscated code can still be dynamically analyzed with standard
debuggers to perform step-wise execution and to inspect (or change)
memory content at important execution points, e.g., to alter the verdict
of license validity checks. Although some approaches have been proposed
to mitigate debugger-based attacks, they are only applicable to binary
compiled code and none address the challenge of protecting Java
bytecode.
In this article, we propose a novel approach to protect Java bytecode
from malicious debugging. Our approach is based on automated program
transformation to manipulate Java bytecode and split it into two binary
processes that debug each other (i.e., a self-debugging solution). In
fact, when the debugging interface is already engaged, an additional
malicious debugger cannot attach. To be resilient against typical
attacks, our approach adopts a series of technical solutions, e.g., an
encoded channel is shared by the two processes to avoid leaking
information, an authentication protocol is established to avoid
Man-in-the-middle attacks, and the computation is spread between the two
processes to prevent the attacker to replace or terminate either of
them.
We test our solution on 18 real-world Java applications, showing that
our approach can effectively block the most common debugging tasks
(either with the Java debugger or the GNU debugger) while preserving the
functional correctness of the protected programs. While the final
decision on when to activate this protection is still up to the
developers, the observed performance overhead was acceptable for common
desktop application domains.},

@article{WOS:001209927600050,
  abstract = {Java decompilers are programs that perform the reverse process of Java
compilers, i.e., they translate Java bytecode to Java source code. They
are essential for reverse engineering purposes and have become more
sophisticated and reliable over the years. However, it remains
challenging for modern Java decompilers to reliably perform correct
decompilation on real-world programs. To shed light on the key
challenges of Java decompilation, this paper provides the first
systematic study on the characteristics and causes of bugs in mature,
widely-used Java decompilers. We conduct the study by investigating 333
unique bugs from three popular Java decompilers. Our key findings and
observations include: (1) Although most of the reported bugs were found
when decompiling large, real-world code, 40.2\% of them have small test
cases for bug reproduction; (2) Over 80\% of the bugs manifest as
exceptions, syntactic errors, or semantic errors, and bugs with source
code artifacts are very likely semantic errors; (3) 57.7\%, 39.0\%, and
41.1\% of the bugs respectively are attributed to three stages of
decompilers-loading structure entities from bytecode, optimizing these
entities, and generating source code from these entities; (4) Bugs in
decompilers' type inference are the most complex to fix; and (5) Region
restoration for structures like loop, sugaring for special structures
like switch, and type inference of variables of generic types or
indistinguishable types are the three most significant challenges in
Java decompilation, which to some extent explains our findings in (3)
and (4).
Based on these findings, we present JD-Tester, a differential testing
framework for Java decompilers, and our experience of using it in
testing the three popular Java decompilers. JD-Tester utilizes different
Java program generators to construct executable Java tests and finds
exceptions, syntactic, and semantic inconsistencies (i.e. bugs) between
a generated test and its compiled-decompiled version (through
compilation and execution). In total, we have found 62 bugs in the three
decompilers, demonstrating both the effectiveness of JD-Tester, and the
importance of testing and validating Java decompilers.},

  abstract = {Adequately selecting variable names is a difficult activity for
practitioners. In 2018, Jaffe et al. proposed the use of statistical
machine translation (SMT) to suggest descriptive variable names for
decompiled code. A large corpus of decompiled C code was used to train
the SMT model. Our paper presents the results of a partial replication
of Jaffe's experiment. We apply the same technique and methodology to a
dataset made of code written in the Pharo programming language. We
selected Pharo since its syntax is simple - it fits on half of a
postcard - and because the optimizations performed by the compiler are
limited to method scope. Our results indicate that SMT may recover
between 8.9\% and 69.88\% of the variable names depending on the
training set. Our replication concludes that: (i) the accuracy depends
on the code similarity between the training and testing sets; (ii) the
simplicity of the Pharo syntax and the satisfactory decompiled code
alignment have a positive impact on predicting variable names; and (iii)
a relatively small code corpus is sufficient to train the SMT model,
which shows the applicability of the approach to less popular
programming languages. Additionally, to assess SMT's potential in
improving original variable names, ten Pharo developers reviewed 400 SMT
name suggestions, with four reviews per variable. Only 15 suggestions
(3.75\%) were unanimously viewed as improvements, while 45 (11.25\%)
were perceived as improvements by at least two reviewers, highlighting
SMT's limitations in providing suitable alternatives.},

  abstract = {Future protocols in the digital society will be built on the foundation
of smart contracts, which are code and algorithmic contracts. Smart
contracts enable all phases of the contracting process without the need
for outside parties by using protocols and user interfaces. But as
blockchain technology has quickly advanced, many security flaws in smart
contracts have also come to light. This article offers a thorough
examination and organized summary of the pertinent material of smart
contract security analysis. These sections make up the bulk of our
survey's contributions. First, a brief history of Ethereum is provided,
followed by a proposal of the security difficulties now faced by
blockchain smart contracts, with a focus on the analysis and
classification of various security flaws. Second, based on a thorough
examination of these studies, we present a summary of various smart
contract security options, including case studies and detailed
descriptions of the state-of-the-art in terms of automatic auditing,
subject matter experts, scalable smart contracts, smart contract
templates, decompilers, semantic frameworks, and anomaly detection.
Finally, we go over each sort of solution's advantages and disadvantages
and outline potential future research trajectories.},

  abstract = {Ransomware is one of the most extended cyberattacks. It consists of
encrypting a user's files or locking the smartphone in order to
blackmail a victim. The attacking software is ordered on the infected
device from the attacker's remote server, known as command and control.
In this work, we propose a method to recover from a Locker.CB!tr
ransomware attack after it has infected and hit a smartphone. The
novelty of our approach lies on exploiting the communication between the
ransomware on the infected device and the attacker's command and control
server as a point to reverse disruptive actions like screen locking or
file encryption. For this purpose, we carried out both a dynamic and a
static analysis of decompiled Locker.CB!tr ransomware source code to
understand its operation principles and exploited communication patterns
from the IP layer to the application layer to fully impersonate the
command and control server. This way, we gained full control over the
Locker.CB!tr ransomware instance. From that moment, we were able to
command the Locker.CB!tr ransomware instance on the infected device to
unlock the smartphone or decrypt the files. The contributions of this
work are a novel method to recover the mobile phone after ransomware
attack based on the analysis of the ransomware communication with the
C\&C server; and a mechanism for impersonating the ransomware C\&C
server and thus gaining full control over the ransomware instance.},

  abstract = {Binary function analysis is fundamental in understanding the behavior
and genealogy of malware. The detection, classification, and analysis of
Linux IoT malware and its variants present significant challenges due to
the wide range of architectures supported by the Linux IoT platform.
This study concentrates on static analysis using binary lifting
techniques to extract and analyze Intermediate Representation (IR)
opcode sequences. We introduce a set of statistical entropy-based
features derived from these IR opcode sequences, establishing a
practical and straightforward methodology for machine learning
classification models. By exclusively analyzing function metadata and
opcode entropy, our architecture-agnostic approach not only efficiently
detects malware but also classifies its variants with a high degree of
accuracy, achieving an F1 score of 97\%. The proposed approach offers a
robust alternative for enhancing malware detection and variant
identification frameworks for IoT devices.},

  abstract = {Android malware uses anti-reverse analysis and APK shelling technology,
which leads to the failure of the classification method based on
decompiled features and the reduction of the classification accuracy
based on single file features. Moreover, the lack of samples in some
families of Android malware makes the classification model based on
sample learning ineffective. To solve the above problems, this paper
proposes a two-layer general framework for Android malware
classification and adversarial training named GMADV, which enhances
classifier performance through adversarial training. In the sample
classification layer, based on the transformation method of the Markov
model, it is proposed for the first time to convert the three files in
the APK into RGB Markov images, and use VGG13 to automatically extract
features and classification; In the variant amplification layer, the
idea of ``regression for generation{''} is firstly proposed, and GMM-GAN
based on Gaussian process is designed to amplify the diversity of
samples within the family. The experimental results show that RGB Markov
images have better classification performance than grayscale images. On
the three datasets, the classification effect after amplification has
been improved to varying degrees, and all F1\_Score reaches 95 \%.
Compared with other methods, GMADV has stronger family sample
amplification ability and greater adversarial intensity.},

  abstract = {Industrial Control System (ICS) depends on the underlying Programmable
Logical Controllers (PLCs) to run. As such, the security of the internal
control logic of the PLCs is the top concern of ICS. Reversing analysis
and forensic work against PLC require extracting control logic from the
control application running inside PLC, which is still an unresolved
problem. To address the challenge, we propose a PLC decompile framework
named CLEVER, which can analyze the control application and extract the
control logic. First, we propose a simulation execution based code
extraction method, which is utilized to filter the control logic related
data. Then, to normalize the control application decompile process, an
intermediate representation (IR) is designed, which can simplify the
analysis process and enhance the extensibility of CLEVER. Finally, a
heuristic data flow analysis algorithm is proposed to find variable
dependency, and a sequential parsing method is utilized to reconstruct
the source code from the control application. To evaluate our work, real
world PLC hardware and programming software are used for the experiment.
We use 22 real-world, 58 hand-written, and 150 auto-generated control
applications to demonstrate the usability, correctness, and operational
efficiency of CLEVER.},

  abstract = {Static taint analysis is a widely used method to identify
vulnerabilities in Android applications. However, the existing tools for
static analysis often struggle with processing times, particularly when
dealing with complex real-world programs. To reduce time consumption,
some tools choose to sacrifice analytical precision, e.g., FastDroid
sets an upper limit for analysis iterations in Android applications. In
this paper, we propose a labeled taint value graph (LTVG) to store taint
flows, and implement a fine-grained analysis tool called LabeledDroid.
This graph is constructed based on the taint value graph (TVG) of
FastDroid, and takes into account both precision and time consumption.
That is, we decompile an Android app into Jimple statements, develop
finegrained propagation rules to handle List, and construct LTVGs
according to these rules. Afterwards, we traverse LTVGs to obtain
high-precision taint flows. An analysis of 39 apps from the TaintBench
benchmark shows that LabeledDroid is 0.87 s faster than FastDroid on
average. Furthermore, if some common accuracy parameters are adapted in
both LabeledDroid and FastDroid, the experiment demonstrates that the
former is more scalable. Moreover, the maximum analysis time of
LabeledDroid is less than 200 s and its average time is 46.25 s, while
FastDroid sometimes experiences timeouts with durations longer than 600
s. Additionally, LabeledDroid achieves a precision of 70\% in handling
lists, while FastDroid and TaintSA achieve precisions of 38.9\% and
41.2\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Cybersecurity attacks on embedded devices for industrial control systems
and cyber-physical systems may cause catastrophic physical damage as
well as economic loss. This could be achieved by infecting device
binaries with malware that modifies the physical characteristics of the
system operation. Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse
engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of
mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional
reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but
offer little semantic insight. This article proposes the REMaQE
automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from
binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles
equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or
pointers, and can reverse engineer equations from object-oriented
implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug
in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool ``tmon.{''} To evaluate
REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations
implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a
semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes
in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations.
Real-time execution enables integration in an interactive math-oriented
reverse engineering workflow.},

  abstract = {One of the tasks of security analysts is to detect security
vulnerabilities and ongoing attacks. There is already a large number of
software tools that can help to collect security-relevant data, such as
event logs, security settings, application manifests, and even the
(decompiled) source code of potentially malicious applications. The
analyst must study these data, evaluate them, and properly identify and
classify suspicious activities and applications. Fast advances in the
area of Artificial Intelligence have produced large language models that
can perform a variety of tasks, including generating text summaries and
reports. In this article, we study the potential black-box use of LLM
chatbots as a support tool for security analysts. We provide two case
studies: the first is concerned with the identification of
vulnerabilities in Android applications, and the second one is concerned
with the analysis of security logs. We show how LLM chatbots can help
security analysts in their work, but point out specific limitations and
security concerns related to this approach.},

  abstract = {FPGA bitstream is a binary file containing chip configuration
information. It is often compressed to conserve storage space and reduce
configuration time. However, if the bitstream file is compressed,
hardware attacks cannot be detected because FPGA reverse-engineering
tools can only decompile uncompressed and unencrypted bitstream. This
study proposes a low complexity decompression method for commercial FPGA
bitstreams, which is a crucial step for assessing the security of FPGAs.
By comparing the structure of compressed and uncompressed bitstream
files, we identify the compression region, extract the compressed data,
and construct a database for the mapping information. Then, we introduce
a decoding algorithm that utilizes a sliding window approach based on
the characteristics of the compressed data and implement the algorithm
on an Intel Cyclone V FPGA. Finally, the proposed framework is validated
on 24 different types of Intel FPGAs from 6 families, with a perfect
accuracy rate of 100\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
paper to disclose a decompression method for commercial FPGAs.},

  abstract = {Code similarity detection identifies code by analyzing similarities in
syntax, semantics, and structure, which includes types of tasks:
source-to-source, binary-to-binary, and source-to-binary. Due to
encoding and representation disparities between source and binary code,
existing methods have mainly focused on individual tasks, without
providing a universal solution. Additionally, current source-to-binary
tasks only achieve one-to-one matching between source code and binary
functions, neglecting the one-to-many relationship inherent between
source code and its cross-compiled binaries. In this paper, we propose
CrossCode2Vec, a unified framework for representing code in both source
and binary functions, which aims to bridge the gap in original coding
features and provide a standardized similarity measurement across three
code similarity detection tasks. For source code and its corresponding
compiled binary, we first design an enhanced Abstract Path Context data
preprocessing method, construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) from both
source code functions and decompiled binary functions, and implement the
function embedding followed by the pre-trained Word2vec model. Then we
propose a task-specific data sampling strategy. We establish a
one-to-one correspondence between source and binary functions through
symbol tables and create a one-to-many relationship between source
functions and their cross-compiled binaries based on sampling rules.
Finally, we employ a hierarchical LSTM-attention network to facilitate
the representation and similarity measurement of functions. We conduct
both extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations to confirm the effectiveness of
CrossCode2Vec in code representation and code similarity tasks,
validating its superiority in model architecture and data processing
methods. CrossCode2Vec demonstrates stable and exceptional performance
across multiple experiments, reinforcing its ability to bridge the gap
between source and binary code representations while effectively
measuring their similarities.},

  abstract = {Since funds or tokens in smart contracts are maintained through specific
state variables, contract audit, an effective means for security
assurance, particularly focuses on these variables and their related
operations. However, the absence of publicly accessible source code for
numerous contracts, with only bytecode exposed, hinders audit efforts.
Recovering variables and their types from Solidity bytecode is thus a
critical task in smart contract analysis and audit, yet this is a
challenging task because the bytecode loses variable and type
information, only with low-level data operated by stack manipulations
and untyped memory/storage accesses. The state-of-the-art smart contract
decompilers miss identifying many variables and incorrectly infer the
types for many identified variables. To this end, we propose VARLIFTER,
a lifter dedicated to the precise and efficient recovery of typed
variables. VARLIFTER interprets every read or written field of a data
region as at least one potential variable, and after discarding falsely
identified variables, it progressively refines the variable types based
on the variable behaviors in the form of operation sequences. We
evaluate VARLIFTER on 34,832 real-world Solidity smart contracts.
VARLIFTER attains a precision of 97.48\% and a recall of 91.84\% for
typed variable recovery. Moreover, VARLIFTER finishes analyzing 77\% of
smart contracts in around 10 seconds per contract. If VARLIFTER is used
to replace the variable recovery modules of the two state-of-the-art
Solidity bytecode decompilers, 52.4\%, and 74.6\% more typed variables
will be correctly recovered, respectively. The applications of VARLIFTER
to contract decompilation, contract audit, and contract bytecode fuzzing
illustrate that the recovered variable information improves many
contract analysis tasks.},

  abstract = {The .NET framework is widely used for software development, making it a
target for a significant number of malware attacks by developing
malicious executables. Previous studies on malware detection often
relied on developing generic detection methods for Windows malware that
were not tailored to the unique characteristics of .NET executables. As
a result, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the
development of effective detection methods tailored to .NET malware.
This work introduces a novel framework for detecting malicious .NET
executables using statically extracted method names. To address the lack
of datasets focused exclusively on .NET malware, a new dataset
consisting of both malicious and benign .NET executable features was
created. Our approach involves decompiling .NET executables, parsing the
resulting code, and extracting standard .NET method names. Subsequently,
feature selection techniques were applied to filter out less relevant
method names. The performance of six machine learning models-XGBoost,
random forest, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM),
logistic regression, and na \& iuml;ve Bayes-was compared. The results
indicate that XGBoost outperforms the other models, achieving an
accuracy of 96.16\% and an F1-score of 96.15\%. The experimental results
show that standard .NET method names are reliable features for detecting
.NET malware.},

  abstract = {The exponential growth of Android applications has resulted in a surge
of malware threats, posing severe risks to user privacy and data
security. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel
malware detection approach utilizing an ensemble of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) for enhanced classification accuracy. The methodology
incorporates a multi-phase process, starting with the extraction and
preprocessing of APK (Android app) files. The preprocessing phase
involves decompressing, decompiling, and transforming the APK files into
bytecode and Dex files. The extracted byte data is converted into 1D
vectors and reshaped into 2D grayscale images, enabling efficient
feature learning through CNNs. The proposed ensemble of CNN-based models
undergoes comprehensive training, validation, and evaluation,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches. We
used two popular Android datasets to evaluate the performance of our
proposed model. Specifically, the model achieves an accuracy of 98.65\%,
F1-score of 96.43\% on the Drebin dataset and attains 97.91\% accuracy,
96.73\% of F1-score on the AMD dataset. These results confirm the mode's
ability to effectively identify Android malware with high precision and
reliability, outperforming traditional techniques. This research not
only underscores the potential of our proposed approach in malware
detection but also sets a foundation for future advancements. Future
efforts will focus on real-time malware detection, integration with
mobile security frameworks, and evaluation across diverse datasets to
ensure adaptability to emerging malware threats.},

  abstract = {Purpose- The openness of the Android operating system offers users
convenience but also exposes them to a multitude of malicious
applications. Consequently, analyzing applications before installation
has become a crucial research area in mobile security. Static analysis,
known for its accuracy and low cost, is a prominent method within this
field. This paper aims to propose an ML/DL-based approach to detect
benign and malicious applications in APK format.
Design/methodology/approach- The analysis method, detailed further in
the paper, consists of five steps. Step 1, each APK file in the sample
set undergoes decompilation to convert it into source code. Then,
directed API call graph (DACG) generator is used to analyze the
decompiled source code from Step 1 and extract API calls. After that,
the authors apply the graph2vec method to convert the DACG data set into
characteristic subgraphs. Next, saving the necessary features that each
model needs to learn from the vector set. This helps reduce the vector
dimensionality for each model type and reduces time and noise by
eliminating unnecessary features. Finally, training and evaluating the
ability to detect Android malware based on popular machine learning
algorithms such as Random Forest, support vector machine, K-nearest
neighbor, logistic regression and one of the most powerful machine
learning algorithms currently available, gradient boosting regression.
Findings- The authors come to the conclusion, feature graphs based on
API call graphs are effective in detecting Android malware. Experimental
results demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over existing
detection methods on a data set of 7,000 samples, achieving TPR > 97\%,
FPR < 1\% and AUC similar to 0.98. Following these steps, a final
classification will determine the safety of the tested application,
aiding users in avoiding malware installation. Research
limitations/implications- Although some limitations remain to be
addressed, the DACG construction method holds significant potential for
further exploration. Future research will focus on integrating dynamic
analysis techniques to broaden the detectable and classifiable Android
malware categories. In addition, the authors aim to adapt the
methodology for broader applicability to other system types, including
the widely used ELF systems in Linux. Originality/value- In the study,
the authors addressed the issue of generating graph-based feature for
Android malware detection in a meaningful, practical and efficient way.
The results can be used as a pattern for similar scenarios and
applications.},

  abstract = {Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT) provides a sound and complete
framework to reason about trace equivalence between simple imperative
programs. However, there are still several notable limitations. First,
GKAT is completely agnostic with respect to the meaning of primitives,
to keep equivalence decidable. Second, GKAT excludes non-local control
flow such as goto, break, and return. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Control-Flow GKAT (CF-GKAT), a system that allows reasoning
about programs that include non-local control flow as well as hardcoded
values. CF-GKAT is able to soundly and completely verify trace
equivalence of a larger class of programs, while preserving the
nearly-linear efficiency of GKAT. This makes CF-GKAT suitable for the
verification of control-flow manipulating procedures, such as
decompilation and goto-elimination. To demonstrate CF-GKAT's abilities,
we validated the output of several highly non-trivial program
transformations, such as Erosa and Hendren's goto-elimination procedure
and the output of Ghidra decompiler. CF-GKAT opens up the application of
Kleene Algebra to a wider set of challenges, and provides an important
verification tool that can be applied to the field of decompilation and
control-flow transformation.},

  abstract = {The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought convenience
to people's lives, but it also introduces significant security risks.
Due to the limitations of IoT devices themselves and the challenges of
re-hosting technology, existing fuzzing for IoT devices is mainly
conducted through black-box methods, which lack effective execution
feedback and are blind. Meanwhile, the existing static methods mainly
rely on taint analysis, which has high overhead and high false alarm
rates. We propose a new directed fuzz testing method for detecting bugs
in web service programs of IoT devices, which can test IoT devices more
quickly and efficiently. Specifically, we identify external input entry
points using multiple features. Then we quickly find sensitive targets
and paths affected by external input sources based on sensitive data
flow analysis of decompiled code, treating them as testing objects.
Finally, we perform a directed fuzzing test. We use debugging interfaces
to collect execution feedback and guide the program to reach sensitive
targets based on program pruning techniques. We have implemented a
prototype system, AntDFuzz, and evaluated it on firmware from ten
devices across five well-known manufacturers. We discovered twelve
potential vulnerabilities, seven of which were confirmed and assigned
bug id by China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD). The results show
that our approach has the ability to find unknown bugs in real devices
and is more efficient compared to existing tools.},

  abstract = {Recent approaches to binary-source code matching often operate at the
intermediate representation (IR) level, with some applying the matching
process at the binary level by compiling the source code to binary and
then matching it directly with the binary code. Others, though less
common, perform matching at the decompiler-generated pseudo-code level
by first decompiling the binary code into pseudo-code and then comparing
it with the source code. However, all these approaches are limited by
the loss of semantic information in the original source code and the
introduction of noise during compilation and decompilation, making
accurate matching challenging and often requiring specialized expertise.
To address these limitations, this study introduces a system for
binary-source code matching based on decompilation techniques and Graph
analysis (BSMDG) that matches binary code with source code at the source
code level. Our method utilizes the Ghidra decompiler in conjunction
with a custom-built transpiler to reconstruct highlevel C++ source code
from binary executables. Subsequently, call graphs (CGs) and control
flow graphs (CFGs) are generated for both the original and translated
code to evaluate their structural and semantic similarities. To evaluate
our system, we used a curated dataset of C++ source code and
corresponding binary files collected from the AtCoder website for
training and testing. Additionally, a case study was conducted using the
widely recognized POJ-104 benchmark dataset to assess the system's
generalizability. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining
decompilation with graph-based analysis, with our system achieving 90\%
accuracy on POJ-104, highlighting its potential in code clone detection,
vulnerability identification, and reverse engineering tasks.},

  abstract = {Compilers play a crucial role in software development, as most software
must be compiled into binaries before release. Analyzing the compiler
version from binary files is of great importance in software reverse
engineering, maintenance, traceability, and information security. In
this work, we propose a novel framework for compiler version
identification. Firstly, we generated 1000 C language source codes using
CSmith and subsequently compiled them into 16,000 binary files using 16
distinct versions of compilers. The symmetric distribution of the
dataset among different compiler versions may ensure unbiased model
training. Then, IDA Pro was used to decompile the binary files into
assembly instruction sequences. From these sequences, we extracted
frequency-based features via the Bag-of-Words (BOW) model and
sequence-based features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix
(GLCM). Finally, we introduced a divide-and-conquer framework
(DIANA-SVM) to effectively classify compiler versions. The experimental
results demonstrate that traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) models
struggle to accurately identify compiler versions using compiled
executable files. In contrast, DIANA-SVM's symmetric data separation
approach enhances performance, achieving an accuracy of 94\% (+/-
0.375\%). This framework enables precise identification of high-risk
compiler versions, offering a reliable tool for software supply chain
security. Theoretically, our GLCM-based sequence modeling and
divide-and-conquer framework advance feature extraction methodologies
for binary files, offering a scalable solution for similar
classification tasks beyond compiler identification.},

  abstract = {The architecture of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) has evolved into an
integrated cyber-physical system, introducing covert, zero-dynamic
cyberattack vectors that threaten the reliability of ICS. We address two
issues: (1) how to use decentralized solutions to defend
resource-constrained ICS against highly covert zero-dynamic attacks; (2)
how to improve performance (meeting real-time, high-frequency
interaction demands) while enhancing reliability via decentralization.
We propose a defense model integrating blockchain, zero-knowledge
proofs, and smart contract (SC) obfuscation to bolster ICS resilience. A
customized zk-SNARK algorithm enables efficient identity authentication,
completed in under 3 ms. The Garble framework obfuscates SCs, concealing
ICS device IP addresses and disrupting attack chains. A blockchain acts
as a secure intermediary between the engineer workstation (EW) and
programmable logic controller (PLC). To reduce blockchain overhead, we
refine a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based roulette wheel
algorithm. Obfuscated SCs resist decompilation by tools such as Objdump,
ensuring robust protection. Our node selection mechanism balances
security and diversity, mitigating systemic biases like the Matthew
effect. By leveraging blockchain to supply computational power for
encrypting and protecting ICS data flows, we offer new insights into
defending ICS against highly covert cyberattacks. Experimental
evaluation validates the model's effectiveness under real-world ICS
scenarios.},

  abstract = {Reverse engineering complex proprietary software is a tedious and time
consuming task. A fair amount of the overall effort is usually devoted
to locating those software components which are responsible for the
functionality of interest (e.g., a proprietary encryption algorithm). To
aid this process, several tools, available in the public domain, can be
used, implementing sophisticated algorithms for control-flow recovery,
stack frame recovery, data type inference, decompilation etc. However,
the important problem of decomposing a binary executable to its
constituent object files (or compile-units) has not been, in our
opinion, sufficiently studied. In this paper we present novel techniques
for estimating the number, as well as the boundaries, of compile-units
in binary executables. We present algorithms which recover information
that improves the precision degree in reverse engineering tasks. In
addition, our algorithms can be used to reduce the effort of locating,
recovering and understanding specific functionalities of closed-source
software. We evaluate our algorithms on the public DeepBinDiff ELF
dataset, consisting of \textbackslash{}documentclass{[}12pt]\{minimal\}

approach the ground-truth, with an average recovery precision close to
75\%. Furthermore, we show how our research can aid in binary diffing
applications, by comparing the recovered compile-unit structure of a
pair of Microsoft Windows kernel images. We make our prototype

  abstract = {Natural hierarchical porous materials, inspired by biological systems
like plant vascular networks, hold trans-formative potential for
energy-efficient and environmental applications. However, translating
these natural designs into engineered aerogels with precise multiscale
pore control and multifunctional performance remains a critical
challenge. To address this gap, we propose a dual-innovation strategy
integrating bioinspired structural engineering and composite property
synergy. First, we developed an aramid-fiber
decompilation/reconstruction process using ultrasound-assisted
hydrothermal cracking to produce platelet nanofibers. Second, a dynamic
icetemplating technique was employed to create annular temperature
gradients, enabling directional self-assembly of nanofibers into
density-gradient pore architectures. This bioinspired based design not
only replicates the structural complexity of natural systems and
realizes the interfacial synergy of the components (embodied by a
negative Poisson's ratio of-0.30 and an ultra-high porosity of 94.20
\%), but also confers an excellent fatigue resistance to Si@ANF/CNF
aerogel, which maintains a strain retention rate of 83.06 \% after 100
cycles of 50 \% strain. The resulting composite system demonstrates
exceptional multifunctionality, including excellent oil-water separation
capability (49-102 g/g, 99.76 \% water repellency) and superior thermal
insulation (0.044 W/m \& sdot;K at 160 degrees C). By demonstrating that
bioinspired structural precision inherently enables multifunctional
optimization, this work bridges the gap between natural design
principles and scalable engineering solutions, offering a sustainable
platform for advanced aerogel applications.},

  abstract = {Cybersecurity threats continue to escalate with the rapid advancement of
internet technology, with malicious code posing a particularly daunting
challenge. Traditional detection methods based on feature code matching
struggle to keep pace with evolving anti-detection techniques and the
proliferation of malicious code variants. Current malware detection
often relies on extracting opcode sequences or converting binary files
into grayscale maps for analysis based on deep learning. However,
text-based methods for malware detection face decompilation errors due
to obfuscation, which compromise feature extraction accuracy, and the
limitation of n-gram in capturing global behavior patterns beyond local
opcode sequences. Image-based methods, on the other hand, risk losing
code structure and semantics during image conversion, and the need for
fixed-size inputs in convolutional neural networks can lead to feature
information loss during resizing or cropping. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes feature fusion-based squeeze and
excitation (FFSE)-bidirectional temporal convolutional network (BiTCN),
a novel hybrid malware detection model that integrates the advantages of
FFSE and BiTCN. The FFSE is utilized to extract multi-scale features and
fuse global and local features with a channel attention mechanism, while
the BiTCN is adopted to capture temporal evolution of malware behavior
and integrate features of different levels with a pooling fusion
mechanism. Experimental results on the BIG2015 and DataCon datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing malware
detection methods in terms of Accuracy , Recall , and F1-score . It
proves the robustness and generalization of the proposed model and
contributes significantly to the field of malware detection.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of Android-based mobile and IoT applications has
significantly increased the attack surface for malicious actors. These
adversaries often exploit apps and social engineering to deliver malware
that compromises device security and user privacy. To address this
ongoing threat, we present AndroMD, an intelligent and scalable Android
malware detection framework that combines automated dataset
construction, optimal feature selection, and ensemble-based
classification. The proposed framework is built on three core
components. First, an automated pipeline processes over 600,000 APKs to
extract static features from more than 140 million Java files and
600,000 manifest files, resulting in three distinct datasets: KeyCount,
ZeroOne, and MNF. These datasets are constructed using keys and patterns
derived from a detailed analysis of real decompiled malware code,
ensuring semantic relevance. Second, we introduce the AndroMD Optimal
Feature Selection (AOFS) method, which selects compact, high-performing
feature subsets using iterative evaluation based on ensemble feedback.
Third, an ensemble detection model combines Random Forest, Decision
Tree, and Bagging classifiers, with a threshold-based aggregation
mechanism that allows fine-grained control over detection sensitivity.
Extensive evaluation demonstrates AndroMD's strong performance,
achieving up to 99.88\% accuracy on internal datasets and 91.66\%
accuracy in live testing, including detection of custom and zero-day
malware samples. AndroMD also identifies threats overlooked by
VirusTotal, showcasing its real-world applicability. The framework,
along with sample datasets and code, is made publicly available to
support reproducibility and further research on Android security.},

  abstract = {The cybersecurity threats targeting industrial control systems (ICSs)
are evolving with increasing sophistication. Addressing the detection
blind spots in existing source code analysis techniques, this study
reveals a dual security paradox arising from code sensitivity: privacy
leakage risks caused by decompilation techniques and integrity
verification deficiencies in reverse engineering. This article
investigates three critical challenges: 1) what are the component flow
process and detection elements of ICS component source code? 2) how can
high-performance and reliable tracing and traceability be provided for
ICS component source code exceptions and routine detection? and 3) how
can privacy enhancement and trusted detection of ICS component source
code with high sensitivity be achieved? This article proposes a
blockchain-integrated trusted detection framework for ICS (BCTD-ICS),
delivering groundbreaking solutions: 1) establishing a lifecycle
circulation model that systematically maps component types,
stakeholders, and detection parameters; 2) developing a tripartite
collaborative architecture {[}blockchain- identification resolution
zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)], featuring a traceability mechanism with
trusted identification codes (resolution efficiency: 40 ms/105 queries)
to eliminate decompilation-induced privacy risks; and 3) creating an
industrial-oriented privacy enhancement system utilizing DBSCAN
clustering for intelligent sampling (26\% compression rate on BCN3D
Moveo) and optimizing ZK-SNARK protocols through Shamir's secret
sharing, establishing a backdoor-resistant distributed parameter
generation system (time delay increment < 100 ms). Experimentally
verified, our solution enables ICS component code detection
supply-chain-wise without sensitive data leakage in real-world
industries. This work establishes a novel trusted detection paradigm for
ICS, advancing detection efficiency and credibility under strict privacy
preservation requirements, meeting Industry 4.0 security demands.},

  abstract = {Malware detection is a necessity in the modern digital world. This
research presents a novel MalSFF: Multi-Architecture Malware Detection
Using Multi-Static Feature Fusion Based on visual image analysis and
transfer learning. Firstly, it decompiles binary programs to extract
bytecodes and assembly code (ASM) through reverse-engineering before
transforming them into grayscale images. This research strategically
fine-tunes the MobileNet models (V1, V2, V3-Small, and V3-Large) for
feature extraction of both file types. Thereafter, it performs feature
stacking through early fusion, late fusion, and ensemble voting to
obtain a single feature map, and then utilizes a filter-based feature
selection algorithm. Finally, the MalSFF employs six different
classifiers, with optimized hyperparameters using an automated
grid-search algorithm. For better generalization, this study uses four
different datasets: (i) Microsoft BIG, (ii) MalImg, (iii) Dumpware10,
and (iv) Real-world samples. The MalSFF achieved 98.72\% accuracy for
the MalImg and 96.93\% accuracy, 97\% precision, 97\% recall, and 97\%
F1-score, 0.012 ms of response time for the BIG dataset. For
memory-resident malware, it achieved 93.84\% accuracy and a 91\%
F1-score, with a response time of only 0.05 s. The MalSFF demonstrates
resilience against FGSM, PGD, and DeepFool adversarial attacks. The
MalSFF is a lightweight and computationally efficient, well-suited for
resource-constrained IIoT networks.},

  abstract = {The complexities introduced by compiler optimization have long stood as
a significant obstacle in binary analysis and reverse engineering.
Function inlining, in particular, complicates function recognition by
replacing function calls with the entire body of the callee, mixing code
from multiple functions. State-of-the-art approaches can identify
inlined functions at basic block granularity, but cannot determine which
instructions belong to each function and precisely deduce inlined
boundaries. Without this information, further analyses such as
decompilation cannot be performed effectively. This article presents
Highliner, a novel approach that improves state-of-the-art approaches by
identifying inline instances at instruction-level granularity. Highliner
operates downstream of block-level detectors: given basic blocks
reported by state-of-the-art approaches as belonging to a specific
inlined function, it labels each instruction as Inlined or Not inlined
and recovers the inlined-function boundaries. We treat the problem as a
sequence tagging task typical of NLP and implement a learning-based
technique involving instruction embedding and recurrent neural networks.
We compile a dataset of open-source projects with different
optimizations and use the DWARF debug information standard to construct
labeled sequences of inline instructions. We use this dataset to train,
validate, and test a sequence labeling architecture in which
instructions are encoded via the pre-trained assembly language
transformer PalmTree and then processed by an RNN-based classifier to
produce binary predictions. When evaluated as a binary classifier,
Highliner achieves an F1-score of 0.94 overall. In addition, when
specifically tested on recognizing function boundaries, Highliner
achieves an Accuracy of 0.82 on initial boundaries and 0.83 on final
boundaries.},

  abstract = {The Android operating system continues to face escalating security
challenges, primarily due to its open-source nature and the rapid
proliferation of applications from untrusted sources. Traditional static
analysis tools lack the flexibility to capture evolving malware
behaviors, limiting their interpretability and scalability. Large
Language Models (LLMs) are now applied in cybersecurity for malware
detection, phishing classification, and cyber threat intelligence.
However, their use has not been extended to producing detailed and
interpretable Android malware analysis reports. This study integrates
LLMs into Android malware analysis by creating a dataset for instruction
tuning and fine-tuning the Qwen-7B model using the LoRA method. The
model MalQwen is developed by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5-7B with 429 malware
samples containing decompiled code and expert labeled security reports.
MalQwen outperforms models like Gemini and LLaMA, achieving a BERTscore
of 0.84 for SMS malware and a Perplexity score of 3.30 for Scareware.
These findings confirm MalQwen's superior performance in generating
precise malware reports, validating LLMs as a powerful new method for
Android malware analysis.},

  abstract = {Cryptographic techniques are widely used to safeguard software against
privacy breaches. Efficiently detecting encryption algorithms in
software to determine whether they meet security requirements is a
critical task. However, traditional static and dynamic detection methods
often suffer from high false alarm rates or low efficiency, as they
cannot fully capture the structural and semantic features of
cryptographic algorithms. In this article, we propose FirmCCF, a
vulnerability detection tool for custom cryptographic functions in
Internet of Things (IoT) devices. FirmCCF leverages an improved deep
learning encoder-decoder classification model, CodeT5-cate, to identify
and classify cryptographic functions in source code and decompiled
firmware. It then outputs highly structured meta-level attributes of
cryptographic functions via a large language model (LLM) and detects
vulnerabilities through a query-driven approach. FirmCCF achieves
99.97\% accuracy, 99.72\% recall, and 99.86\% \$F1\$ -score in detecting
cryptographic functions from binary files. We further define seven
security rules, encode them as queries, and use them to uncover seven
categories of vulnerabilities. An evaluation of 40902 function codes
revealed 46 vulnerabilities, including eight previously unknown issues.
Our work highlights the urgent need for systematic assessment solutions
to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in custom cryptographic
functions.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have undergone rapid evolution and achieved remarkable results in recent times. OpenAI's ChatGPT, backed by GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, has gained instant popularity due to its strong capability across a wide range of tasks, including natural language tasks, coding, mathematics, and engaging conversations. However, the impacts and limits of such LLMs in system security domain are less explored. In this paper, we delve into the limits of LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) in seven software security applications including vulnerability detection/repair, debugging, debloating, decompilation, patching, root cause analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing. Our exploration reveals that ChatGPT not only excels at generating code, which is the conventional application of language models, but also demonstrates strong capability in understanding user-provided commands in natural languages, reasoning about control and data flows within programs, generating complex data structures, and even decompiling assembly code. Notably, GPT-4 showcases significant improvements over GPT-3.5 in most security tasks. Also, certain limitations of ChatGPT in security-related tasks are identified, such as its constrained ability to process long code contexts. },

  abstract = {WebAssembly is a low-level bytecode language designed for client-side execution in web browsers. The need for decompilation techniques that recover high-level source code from WASM binaries has grown as WASM continues to gain widespread adoption and its security concerns. However little research has been done to assess the quality of decompiled code from WASM. This paper aims to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis between decompiled C code from WASM binaries and state-of-the-art native binary decompilers. We presented a novel framework for empirically evaluating C-based decompilers from various aspects including correctness/ readability/ and structural similarity. The proposed metrics are validated practicality in decompiler assessment and provided insightful observations regarding the characteristics and constraints of existing decompiled code. This in turn contributes to bolstering the security and reliability of software systems that rely on WASM and native binaries. },

@article{Xie2025,
  abstract = {Demonstrating quantum advantage using conventional quantum algorithms remains challenging on current noisy gate-based quantum computers. Automated quantum circuit synthesis via quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution, employing trainable parametric quantum circuits to alleviate this. The circuit ansatz in these solutions is often designed through reinforcement learning-based quantum architecture search when the domain knowledge of the problem and hardware are not effective. However, the interpretability of these synthesized circuits remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their scalability and applicability across diverse problem domains. This work addresses the challenge of explainability in quantum architecture search (QAS) by introducing a novel genetic programming-based decompiler framework for reverse-engineering high-level quantum algorithms from low-level circuit representations. The proposed approach, implemented in the open-source tool DeQompile, employs program synthesis techniques, including symbolic regression and abstract syntax tree manipulation, to distill interpretable Qiskit algorithms from quantum assembly language. Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating the decompiler with online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms. },

@article{Xu2024,
  abstract = {Decompilation aims to recover the source code form of a binary executable. It has many security applications, such as malware analysis, vulnerability detection, and code hardening. A prominent challenge in decompilation is to recover variable names. We propose a novel technique that leverages the strengths of generative models while mitigating model biases. We build a prototype, GenNm, from pre-trained generative models CodeGemma-2B, CodeLlama-7B, and CodeLlama-34B. We finetune GenNm on decompiled functions and teach models to leverage contextual information. GenNm includes names from callers and callees while querying a function, providing rich contextual information within the model's input token limitation. We mitigate model biases by aligning the output distribution of models with symbol preferences of developers. Our results show that GenNm improves the state-of-the-art name recovery precision by 5.6-11.4 percentage points on two commonly used datasets and improves the state-of-the-art by 32% (from 17.3% to 22.8%) in the most challenging setup where ground-truth variable names are not seen in the training dataset. },

@article{You2024,
  abstract = {PyTorch \texttt\{2.x\} introduces a compiler designed to accelerate deep learning programs. However, for machine learning researchers, adapting to the PyTorch compiler to full potential can be challenging. The compiler operates at the Python bytecode level, making it appear as an opaque box. To address this, we introduce \texttt\{depyf\}, a tool designed to demystify the inner workings of the PyTorch compiler. \texttt\{depyf\} decompiles bytecode generated by PyTorch back into equivalent source code, and establishes connections between in-memory code objects and their on-disk source code counterparts. This feature enables users to step through the source code line by line using debuggers, thus enhancing their understanding of the underlying processes. Notably, \texttt\{depyf\} is non-intrusive and user-friendly, primarily relying on two convenient context managers for its core functionality. The project is \href\{https://github.com/thuml/depyf\}\{ openly available\} and is recognized as a \href\{https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/\}\{PyTorch ecosystem project\}. },

  abstract = {This paper presents several efficient decision procedures for trace equivalence of GKAT automata, which make use of on-the-fly symbolic techniques via SAT solvers. To demonstrate applicability of our algorithms, we designed symbolic derivatives for CF-GKAT, a practical system based on GKAT designed to validate control-flow transformations. We implemented the algorithms in Rust and evaluated them on both randomly generated benchmarks and real-world control-flow transformations. Indeed, we observed order-of-magnitude performance improvements against existing implementations for both KAT and CF-GKAT. Notably, our experiments also revealed a bug in Ghidra, an industry-standard decompiler, highlighting the practical viability of these systems. },

  abstract = {Decompiling Rust binaries is challenging due to the language's rich type system, aggressive compiler optimizations, and widespread use of high-level abstractions. In this work, we conduct a benchmark-driven evaluation of decompilation quality across core Rust features and compiler build modes. Our automated scoring framework shows that generic types, trait methods, and error handling constructs significantly reduce decompilation quality, especially in release builds. Through representative case studies, we analyze how specific language constructs affect control flow, variable naming, and type information recovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for tool developers and highlight the need for Rust-aware decompilation strategies. },
