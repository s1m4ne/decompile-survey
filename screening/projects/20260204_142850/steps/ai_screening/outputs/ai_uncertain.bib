  abstract = {Recovering function signatures is a cornerstone of binary program analysis, yet it remains a challenging task. Existing methods either rely on disassembly-based constraints, which struggle with cross-architecture compatibility and scalability, or adopt learning-based approaches that are resource-intensive and often inaccurate. In this paper, we present CDA, a novel decompilation-based method for recovering function signatures that combines the strengths of multiple decompilers while mitigating their limitations. The core idea behind CDA is leveraging probabilistic constraints to estimate the likelihood of each function signature recovery result produced by decompilers, guided by inference rules specifically designed to address the limitations of decompilers. Based on these probabilities, CDA selects the recovery results with the highest likelihood as the final outcomes. We extensively evaluate CDA across five tasks --- variadic function/position detection, parameter identification, return value detection, and parameter type recovery --- comparing it against state-of-the-art tools, including IDA, Ghidra, Binary Ninja, and TYGR. Experimental results show that CDA outperforms baseline tools across multiple architectures (x64, x86, AArch64, Arm, and Mips) and optimization levels (O0-O3), highlighting its robustness and reliability in diverse compilation environments.},

  abstract = {Modern industry is built, among other things, on software, the presence of vulnerabilities in which is a significant problem. It is more rational to search for vulnerabilities in those representations of the program (source code, algorithms, architecture, etc.) on the basis of which they were developed. However, as a rule, there is difficult-to-analyze machine code available. Obtaining higher-level representations is possible by reverse engineering, carried out in various ways, such as expert, algorithmic, intelligent, enumeration and logging. The qualitative comparison of these representations is given. The current study is devoted to a new method of reverse engineering based on the use of genetic algorithms. The course of the research and the following main scientific results are briefly described: the methodology of reverse engineering of a software system, the model of the life cycle of a program with multi-level vulnerabilities, the concept of genetic de-evolution of program representations, scientific, methodological and algorithmic instrumentation for genetic decompilation, an architectural block for conducting genetic de-evolution of representations with functionality for searching for multi-level vulnerabilities. All results are novel, as well as theoretically and practically significant.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, PHP has consistently been one of the most popular server-side programming languages among developers for web development. To protect intellectual property, various PHP source code obfuscation and encryption methods have been developed, which has led to difficulties in performing security analysis on PHP source code. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of recovering source code by extracting bytecode from PHP during dynamic execution. However, there is still a lack of a universal decompilation method for this kind of bytecode, tailored to PHP’s unique syntax. Thus, we propose a systematic decompilation framework for PHP bytecode. First, we design a unified intermediate representation that eliminates the differences between bytecodes from different PHP versions. Then, we introduce a structural analysis algorithm specifically for PHP syntax, improving upon existing methods to better accommodate PHP’s unique syntax. We use over 3 million lines of PHP code as a dataset and compiled it into PHP bytecode. After decompiling it with our method, we successfully recovered 92% of the classes and 85% of the methods. Furthermore, from the encrypted dataset containing 37 SQL injection and 31 XSS vulnerability patterns, we fully restored the original vulnerability patterns and reconstructed the exploitation chains. Furthermore, we identified a series of vulnerabilities in real-world projects and were assigned 6 new CVE IDs1, demonstrating the correctness of our method and its ability to assist in static analysis for vulnerability discovery.1CVE-2025-45046, CVE-2025-45047, CVE-2025-45048, CVE-2025-45049, CVE-2025-45050, CVE-2025-45052},

  abstract = {Analysis of binary code is a building block of computer security. Especially in malware or firmware analysis where source code oftentimes is not available, techniques like decompilation are utilized to Figure out the functionality of binaries. During the optimization phase in modern compilers, human-readable expressions are often transformed into instruction sequences (compiler idioms or idioms) that may be more efficient in terms of speed or size than the direct translation. However, these transformations are often considerably worse in terms of readability for the analyst. Such compiler specific sequences are not only significantly longer than the apparent translation of the original high-level language operation but also have no trivial correlation to the original expression’s semantics. Modern decompilers address this issue by reverting idioms using static, manually crafted rules. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to find and annotate arithmetic idioms with their corresponding high-level language expressions to significantly simplify manual analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require manual work to create the patterns for matching idioms and significantly less manual labour to derive the transformation rules to calculate the original constants. In our evaluation, we compared the results of PIdARCI against the current academic and commercial state-of-the-art Ghidra, RetDec, and Hex Rays / IDA Pro. We show that PIdARCI matches more than 99% of all considered idioms, exceeding the matching rate of the other approaches.},

  abstract = {Binary code analysis is the foundation of crucial tasks in the security domain; thus building effective binary analysis techniques is more important than ever. Large language models (LLMs) although have brought impressive improvement to source code tasks, do not directly generalize to assembly code due to the unique challenges of assembly: (1) the low information density of assembly and (2) the diverse optimizations in assembly code. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code. Nova outperforms existing techniques on binary code decompilation by up to 14.84 -- 21.58% (absolute percentage point improvement) higher Pass@1 and Pass@10, and outperforms the latest binary code similarity detection techniques by up to 6.17% Recall@1, showing promising abilities on both assembly generation and understanding tasks. },

  abstract = {Cybersecurity attacks on embedded devices for industrial control systems
and cyber-physical systems may cause catastrophic physical damage as
well as economic loss. This could be achieved by infecting device
binaries with malware that modifies the physical characteristics of the
system operation. Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse
engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of
mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional
reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but
offer little semantic insight. This article proposes the REMaQE
automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from
binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles
equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or
pointers, and can reverse engineer equations from object-oriented
implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug
in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool ``tmon.{''} To evaluate
REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations
implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a
semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes
in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations.
Real-time execution enables integration in an interactive math-oriented
reverse engineering workflow.},

  abstract = {Vulnerabilities are challenging to locate and repair, especially when
source code is unavailable and binary patching is required. Manual
methods are time-consuming, require significant expertise, and do not
scale to the rate at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. Automated
methods are an attractive alternative, and we propose Partially
Recompilable Decompilation (PRD) to help automate the process. PRD lifts
suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or
review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level
techniques. Although decompilation and recompilation do not typically
succeed on an entire binary, our approach does because it is limited to
a few functions, such as those identified by our binary fault
localization. We evaluate the assumptions underlying our approach and
find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, up to 79\%
of individual functions are successfully decompiled and recompiled. In
comparison, only 1.7\% of the full C-binaries succeed. When
recompilation succeeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 93.0\% of
the time. We evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process
incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; and
human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand
Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating
only on binaries, perform as well as, and sometimes better than
full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a
success rate consistent with the same tools operating with access to the
entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning
CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those
produced by top CGC teams. For generality, the evaluation includes two
independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world
binaries.},
