    "abstract": "According to Comscore1, Android users in the U.S spend an average of 2.8 hours per day using mobile media. On the other hand, according to Statista reports2, Android users were able to choose between 2.2 million applications on June 2016. Among these applications, there are ones reported by Google Android Security Service3 as malware, virus, or illegal theft. Many tools such as Dex2Jar4, apktool5, and jd-gui6 analyze and reverse engineer Android applications and can be used to illegally copy or transform the applications as well. In order to protect applications from piracy or illegal theft, it is necessary to detect theft by measuring application similarity. In the literature, previous studies on theft detection have measured application similarity at two levels, source or executable code level, which have some limitations. Source codes are not available if the codes are legacy one or are developed by upstream suppliers. In the case of the executable codes, application similarity is measured 1) using the source codes decompiled from the executables, or 2) using the characteristics extracted from the executables (i.e., birthmark). For example, DroidMoss [5] applied a fuzzy hashing technique to effectively localize and detect the changes from app-repackaging behavior. Reference [4] proposed software birthmarks to show the unique characteristics of a program and detected software theft based on the birthmarks.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of programs is an important and well researched topic in information security, specifically for finding bugs in binary programs or analyzing malicious software. Many commonly used techniques rely on dynamic analysis by running samples and monitoring their behavior or are based on the cumbersome and time consuming inspection of plain assembly code.In this paper we present a novel approach for static analysis we are using in bin2llvm, a work-in-progress analysis framework, in order to find and identify cryptographic routines in binary programs. Our approach does not need to run the target of analysis in any way and is based on decompilation of binaries to an intermediate language similar to assembly code, the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), by using the open source decompiler Dagger. After decompilation we are able to apply various analysis techniques to the resulting code. These methods can be easily implemented and extended as optimization passes for the LLVM optimizer and can therefore benefit from its extensive API. Although we discovered certain drawbacks and issues with this approach, our results and proof of concept show that IR code is a very suitable target for analyses and it is well worth driving research further into this topic.",

    "abstract": "We present a new type of attack termed denial of engineering operations in which an attacker can interfere with the normal cycle of an engineering operation leading to a loss of situational awareness. Specifically, the attacker can deceive the engineering software during attempts to retrieve the ladder logic program from a programmable logic controller (PLC) by manipulating the ladder logic on the PLC, such that the software is unable to process it while the PLC continues to execute it successfully. This attack vector can provide sufficient cover for the attacker»s actual scenario to play out while the owner tries to understand the problem and reestablish positive operational control. To enable the forensic analysis and, eventually, eliminate the threat, we have developed the first decompiler for ladder logic programs.Ladder logic is a graphical programming language for PLCs that control physical processes such as power grid, pipelines, and chemical plants; PLCs are a common target of malicious modifications leading to the compromise of the control behavior (and potentially serious consequences). Our decompiler, Laddis, transforms a low-level representation to its corresponding high-level original representation comprising of graphical symbols and connections. The evaluation of the accuracy of the decompiler on the program of varying complexity demonstrates perfect reconstruction of the original program. We present three new attack scenarios on PLC-deployed ladder logic and demonstrate the effectiveness of the decompiler on these scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Fitbit fitness trackers record sensitive personal information, including daily step counts, heart rate profiles, and locations visited. By design, these devices gather and upload activity data to a cloud service, which provides aggregate statistics to mobile app users. The same principles govern numerous other Internet-of-Things (IoT) services that target different applications. As a market leader, Fitbit has developed perhaps the most secure wearables architecture that guards communication with end-to-end encryption. In this article, we analyze the complete Fitbit ecosystem and, despite the brand's continuous efforts to harden its products, we demonstrate a series of vulnerabilities with potentially severe implications to user privacy and device security. We employ a range of techniques, such as protocol analysis, software decompiling, and both static and dynamic embedded code analysis, to reverse engineer previously undocumented communication semantics, the official smartphone app, and the tracker firmware. Through this interplay and in-depth analysis, we reveal how attackers can exploit the Fitbit protocol to extract private information from victims without leaving a trace, and wirelessly flash malware without user consent. We demonstrate that users can tamper with both the app and firmware to selfishly manipulate records or circumvent Fitbit's walled garden business model, making the case for an independent, user-controlled, and more secure ecosystem. Finally, based on the insights gained, we make specific design recommendations that can not only mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, but are also broadly applicable to securing future wearable system architectures.",

    "abstract": "A wide range of mobile applications for Apple's iOS platform process sensitive data and, therefore, rely on protective mechanisms natively provided by the operating system. A wrong application of cryptography or security-critical APIs, however, exposes secrets to unrelated parties and undermines the overall security.We introduce an approach for uncovering cryptographic misuse in iOS applications. We present a way to decompile 64-bit ARM binaries to their LLVM intermediate representation (IR). Based on the reverse-engineered code, static program slicing is applied to determine the data flow in relevant code segments. For this analysis to be most accurate, we propose an adapted version of Andersen's pointer analysis, capable of handling decompiled LLVM IR code with type information recovered from the binary. To finally highlight the improper usage of cryptographic APIs, a set of predefined security rules is checked against the extracted execution paths. As a result, we are not only able to confirm the existence of problematic statements in iOS applications but can also pinpoint their origin.To evaluate the applicability of our solution and to disclose possible weaknesses, we conducted a manual and automated inspection on a set of iOS applications that include cryptographic functionality. We found that 343 out of 417 applications (82%) are subject to at least one security misconception. Among the most common flaws are the usage of non-random initialization vectors and constant encryption keys as input to cryptographic primitives.",

    "abstract": "Desktop-manufacturing techniques like 3D printing are increasingly popular because they reduce the cost and complexity of producing customized objects on demand. Unfortunately, the vibrant communities of early adopters, often referred to as \"makers,\" are not well-served by currently available software pipelines. Users today must compose idiosyncratic sequences of tools which are typically repurposed variants of proprietary software originally designed for expert specialists.  This paper proposes fundamental programming-languages techniques to bring improved rigor, reduced complexity, and new functionality to the computer-aided design (CAD) software pipeline for applications like 3D-printing. Compositionality, denotational semantics, compiler correctness, and program synthesis all play key roles in our approach, starting from the perspective that solid geometry is a programming language.  Specifically, we define a purely functional language for CAD called LambdaCAD and a polygon surface-mesh intermediate representation. We then define denotational semantics of both languages to 3D solids and a compiler from CAD to mesh accompanied by a proof of semantics preservation. We illustrate the utility of this foundation by developing a novel synthesis algorithm based on evaluation contexts to \"reverse compile\" difficult-to-edit meshes downloaded from online maker communities back to more-editable CAD programs. All our prototypes have been implemented in OCaml to enable further exploration of functional programming for desktop manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem for smart contracts: full-fledged inter-communicating programs that capture the transaction logic of an account. Unlike programs in mainstream languages, a gas limit restricts the execution of an Ethereum smart contract: execution proceeds as long as gas is available. Thus, gas is a valuable resource that can be manipulated by an attacker to provoke unwanted behavior in a victim's smart contract (e.g., wasting or blocking funds of said victim). Gas-focused vulnerabilities exploit undesired behavior when a contract (directly or through other interacting contracts) runs out of gas. Such vulnerabilities are among the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior may be uncommon in non-attack scenarios and reasoning about it is far from trivial.  In this paper, we classify and identify gas-focused vulnerabilities, and present MadMax: a static program analysis technique to automatically detect gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. Our approach combines a control-flow-analysis-based decompiler and declarative program-structure queries. The combined analysis captures high-level domain-specific concepts (such as \"dynamic data structure storage\" and \"safely resumable loops\") and achieves high precision and scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain in just 10 hours (with decompilation timeouts in 8% of the cases) and flags contracts with a (highly volatile) monetary value of over $2.8B as vulnerable. Manual inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that 81% of the sampled warnings do indeed lead to vulnerabilities, which we report on in our experiment.",

Our approach learns a probabilistic model from \"Big Code\" and uses this model to predict properties of new, unseen programs.The key idea of our work is to transform the program into a representation that allows us to formulate the problem of inferring program properties as structured prediction in machine learning. This enables us to leverage powerful probabilistic models such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and perform joint prediction of program properties.As an example of our approach, we built a scalable prediction engine called JSNICE for solving two kinds of tasks in the context of JavaScript: predicting (syntactic) names of identifiers and predicting (semantic) type annotations of variables. Experimentally, JSNICE predicts correct names for 63% of name identifiers and its type annotation predictions are correct in 81% of cases. Since its public release at http://jsnice.org, JSNice has become a popular system with hundreds of thousands of uses.By formulating the problem of inferring program properties as structured prediction, our work opens up the possibility for a range of new \"Big Code\" applications such as de-obfuscators, decompilers, invariant generators, and others.",

The quality of decompiled code can be a game changer in order to reduce the time and effort required for analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach to restructure the control flow graph recovered from binary programs in a semantics-preserving fashion. The algorithm is designed from the ground up with the goal of producing C code that is both goto-free and drastically reducing the mental load required for an analyst to understand it. As a result, the code generated with this technique is well-structured, idiomatic, readable, easy to understand and fully exploits the expressiveness of C language. The algorithm has been implemented on top of the revng static binary analysis framework. The resulting decompiler, revngc, is compared on real-world binaries with state-of-the-art commercial and open source tools. The results show that our decompilation process introduces between 40% and 50% less extra cyclomatic complexity.",

    "abstract": "Recovering class inheritance from C++ binaries has several security benefits including in solving problems such as decompilation and program hardening. Thanks to the optimization guidelines prescribed by the C++ standard, commercial C++ binaries tend to be optimized. While state-of-the-art class inheritance inference solutions are effective in dealing with unoptimized code, their efficacy is impeded by optimization. Particularly, constructor inlining---or worse exclusion---due to optimization render class inheritance recovery challenging. Further, while modern solutions such as MARX can successfully group classes within an inheritance sub-tree, they fail to establish directionality of inheritance, which is crucial for security-related applications (e.g. decompilation). We implemented a prototype of DeClassifier using Binary Analysis Platform (BAP) and evaluated DeClassifier against 16 binaries compiled using gcc under multiple optimization settings. We show that (1) DeClassifier can recover 94.5% and 71.4% true positive directed edges in the class hierarchy tree (CHT) under O0 and O2 optimizations respectively, (2) a combination of constructor-destructor (ctor-dtor) analysis provides a substantial improvement in inheritance inference than constructor-only (ctor-only) analysis.",

This has been successful for a wide variety of inputs including C programs, XML data, and thread schedules. However, for input that has many internal dependencies, delta debugging scales poorly. Such input includes C#, Java, and Java bytecode and they have presented a major challenge for input reduction until now. In this paper, we show that the core challenge is a reduction problem for dependency graphs, and we present a general strategy for reducing such graphs. We combine this with a novel algorithm for reduction called Binary Reduction in a tool called J-Reduce for Java bytecode. Our experiments show that our tool is 12x faster and achieves more reduction than delta debugging on average. This enabled us to create and submit short bug reports for three Java bytecode decompilers.",

    "abstract": "Android is currently the most popular smartphone platform which occupied 88% of global sale by the end of 2nd quarter 2018. With the popularity of these applications, it is also inviting cybercriminals to develop malware application for accessing important information from smartphones. The major objective of cybercriminals to develop Malware apps or Malicious apps to threaten the organization privacy data, user privacy data, and device integrity. Early identification of such malware apps can help the android user to save private data and device integrity. In this study, features extracted from intermediate code representations obtained using decompilation of APK file are used for providing requisite input data to develop the models for predicting android malware applications. These models are trained using extreme learning with multiple kernel functions ans also compared with the model trained using most frequently used classifiers like linear regression, decision tree, polynomial regression, and logistic regression. This paper also focuses on the effectiveness of data sampling techniques for balancing data and feature selection methods for selecting right sets of significant uncorrelated metrics. The high-value of accuracy and AUC confirm the predicting capability of data sampling, sets of metrics, and training algorithms to malware and normal applications.",

    "abstract": "Mobile phones have become nowadays a commodity to the majority of people. Using them, people are able to access the world of Internet and connect with their friends, their colleagues at work or even unknown people with common interests. This proliferation of the mobile devices has also been seen as an opportunity for the cyber criminals to deceive smartphone users and steel their money directly or indirectly, respectively, by accessing their bank accounts through the smartphones or by blackmailing them or selling their private data such as photos, credit card data, etc. to third parties. This is usually achieved by installing malware to smartphones masking their malevolent payload as a legitimate application and advertise it to the users with the hope that mobile users will install it in their devices. Thus, any existing application can easily be modified by integrating a malware and then presented it as a legitimate one. In response to this, scientists have proposed a number of malware detection and classification methods using a variety of techniques. Even though, several of them achieve relatively high precision in malware classification, there is still space for improvement. In this paper, we propose a text mining all repeated pattern detection method which uses the decompiled files of an application in order to classify a suspicious application into one of the known malware families. Based on the experimental results using a real malware dataset, the methodology tries to correctly classify (without any misclassification) all randomly selected malware applications of 3 categories with 3 different families each.",

Existing binary lifting tools are based on static disassembly and thus have to rely on heuristics to disassemble binaries.In this paper, we present BinRec, a new approach to heuristic-free binary recompilation which lifts dynamic traces of a binary to a compiler-level intermediate representation (IR) and lowers the IR back to a \"recovered\" binary. This enables BinRec to apply rich program transformations, such as compiler-based optimization passes, on top of the recovered representation. We identify and address a number of challenges in binary lifting, including unique challenges posed by our dynamic approach. In contrast to existing frameworks, our dynamic frontend can accurately disassemble and lift binaries without heuristics, and we can successfully recover obfuscated code and all SPEC INT 2006 benchmarks including C++ applications. We evaluate BinRec in three application domains: i) binary reoptimization, ii) deobfuscation (by recovering partial program semantics from virtualization-obfuscated code), and iii) binary hardening (by applying existing compiler-level passes such as AddressSanitizer and SafeStack on binary code).",

Android apps are particularly exposed to malicious reverse engineering, because their code can be easily analyzed and decompiled, or monitored using debugging tools, that were originally meant to be used by developers.In this paper, we propose a solution to identify attempts of malicious reverse engineering on Android apps. Our approach is based on a series of periodic checks on the execution environment (i.e., Android components) and on the app itself. The check outcome is encoded into a Magic Number and send to a sever for validation. The owner of the app is then supposed to take countermeasures and react, by disconnecting or banning the apps under attack.Our empirical validation suggests that the execution overhead caused by our periodic checks is acceptable, because its resource consumption is compatible with the resources commonly available in smartphones.",

    "abstract": "The complexities that arise from the implementation of object-oriented concepts in C++ such as virtual dispatch and dynamic type casting have attracted the attention of attackers and defenders alike. Binary-level defenses are dependent on full and precise recovery of class inheritance tree of a given program. While current solutions focus on recovering single and multiple inheritances from the binary, they are oblivious of virtual inheritance. The conventional wisdom among binary-level defenses is that virtual inheritance is uncommon and/or support for single and multiple inheritances provides implicit support for virtual inheritance. In this paper, we show neither to be true. Specifically, (1) we present an efficient technique to detect virtual inheritance in C++ binaries and show through a study that virtual inheritance can be found in non-negligible number (more than 10% on Linux and 12.5% on Windows) of real-world C++ programs including Mysql and Libstdc++. (2) We show that failure to handle virtual inheritance introduces both false positives and false negatives in the hierarchy tree. These falses either introduce attack surface when the hierarchy recovered is used to enforce CFI policies, or make the hierarchy difficult to understand when it is needed for program understanding (e.g., during decompilation). (3) We present a solution to recover virtual inheritance from COTS binaries. We recover a maximum of 95% and 95.5% (GCC -O0) and a minimum of 77.5% and 73.8% (Clang -O2) of virtual and intermediate bases respectively in the virtual inheritance tree.",

    "abstract": "Malware analysis is key for cybersecurity overall improvement. Analysis tools have been evolving from complete static analyzers to decompilers. Malware decompilation allows for code inspection at higher abstraction levels, easing incident response. However, the decompilation procedure has many challenges, such as opaque constructions, irreversible mappings, semantic gap bridging, among others. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages the human analyst expertise to overcome decompilation challenges. We name this approach \"DoD---debug-oriented decompilation\", in which the analyst is able to reverse engineer the malware sample on his own and to instruct the decompiler to translate selected code portions (e.g., decision branches, fingerprinting functions, payloads etc.) into high level code. With DoD, the analyst might group all decompiled pieces into new code to be analyzed by other tool, or to develop a novel malware sample from previous pieces of code and thus exercise a Proof-of-Concept (PoC). To validate our approach, we propose RevEngE, the Reverse Engineering Engine for malware decompilation and reassembly, a set of GDB extensions that intercept and introspect into executed functions to build an Intermediate Representation (IR) in real-time, enabling any-time decompilation. We evaluate RevEngE with x86 ELF binaries collected from VirusShare, and show that a new malware sample created from the decompilation of independent functions of five known malware samples is considered \"clean\" by all VirusTotal's AVs.",

Without loops or functions, editing CSG can require many coordinated changes, and existing mesh decompilers use heuristics that can obfuscate high-level structure. This paper proposes a second decompilation stage to robustly \"shrink\" unstructured CSG expressions into more editable programs with map and fold operators. We present Szalinski, a tool that uses Equality Saturation with semantics-preserving CAD rewrites to efficiently search for smaller equivalent programs. Szalinski relies on inverse transformations, a novel way for solvers to speculatively add equivalences to an E-graph. We qualitatively evaluate Szalinski in case studies, show how it composes with an existing mesh decompiler, and demonstrate that Szalinski can shrink large models in seconds.",

    "abstract": "A C decompiler converts an executable (the output from a C compiler) into source code. The recovered C source code, once recompiled, will produce an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. With over twenty years of development, C decompilers have been widely used in production to support reverse engineering applications, including legacy software migration, security retrofitting, software comprehension, and to act as the first step in launching adversarial software exploitations. As the paramount component and the trust base in numerous cybersecurity tasks, C decompilers have enabled the analysis of malware, ransomware, and promoted cybersecurity professionals’ understanding of vulnerabilities in real-world systems.  In contrast to this flourishing market, our observation is that in academia, outputs of C decompilers (i.e., recovered C source code) are still not extensively used. Instead, the intermediate representations are often more desired for usage when developing applications such as binary security retrofitting. We acknowledge that such conservative approaches in academia are a result of widespread and pessimistic views on the decompilation correctness. However, in conventional software engineering and security research, how much of a problem is, for instance, reusing a piece of simple legacy code by taking the output of modern C decompilers?  In this work, we test decompilation correctness to present an up-to-date understanding regarding modern C decompilers. We detected a total of 1,423 inputs that can trigger decompilation errors from four popular decompilers, and with extensive manual effort, we identified 13 bugs in two open-source decompilers. Our findings show that the overly pessimistic view of decompilation correctness leads researchers to underestimate the potential of modern decompilers; the state-of-the-art decompilers certainly care about the functional correctness, and they are making promising progress. However, some tasks that have been studied for years in academia, such as type inference and optimization, still impede C decompilers from generating quality outputs more than is reflected in the literature. These issues rarely receive enough attention and can lead to great confusion that misleads users.",

When the input data layout conforms to the visualization design, users can easily specify visualizations by mapping data columns to visual channels of the design.

We propose Falx, a synthesis-powered visualization tool that allows users to specify visualizations in a similarly simple way but without needing to worry about data layout. In Falx, users specify visualizations using examples of how concrete values in the input are mapped to visual channels, and Falx automatically infers the visualization specification and transforms the data to match the design.

    "abstract": "Most of the existing scientific visualizations toward interpretive grammar aim to enhance customizability in either the computation stage or the rendering stage or both, while few approaches focus on the data presentation stage. Besides, most of these approaches leverage the existing components from the general-purpose programming languages (GPLs) instead of developing a standalone compiler, which pose a great challenge about learning curves for the domain experts who have limited knowledge about programming. In this paper, we propose IGScript, a novel script-based interaction grammar tool, to help build scientific data presentation animations for communication. We design a dual-space interface and a compiler which converts natural language-like grammar statements or scripts into a data story animation to make an interactive customization on script-driven data presentations, and then develop a code generator (decompiler) to translate the interactive data exploration animations back into script codes to achieve statement parameters. IGScript makes the presentation animations editable, e.g., it allows to cut, copy, paste, append, or even delete some animation clips. We demonstrate the usability, customizability, and flexibility of IGScript by a user study, four case studies conducted by using four types of commonly-used scientific data, and performance evaluations.",

    "abstract": "Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem for smart contracts: full-fledged intercommunicating programs that capture the transaction logic of an account. A gas limit caps the execution of an Ethereum smart contract: instructions, when executed, consume gas, and the execution proceeds as long as gas is available.Gas-focused vulnerabilities permit an attacker to force key contract functionality to run out of gas---effectively performing a permanent denial-of-service attack on the contract. Such vulnerabilities are among the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior may be uncommon in nonattack scenarios and reasoning about these vulnerabilities is nontrivial.In this paper, we identify gas-focused vulnerabilities and present MadMax: a static program analysis technique that automatically detects gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. MadMax combines a smart contract decompiler and semantic queries in Datalog. Our approach captures high-level program modeling concepts (such as \"dynamic data structure storage\" and \"safely resumable loops\") and delivers high precision and scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain in just 10 hours and flags vulnerabilities in contracts with a monetary value in billions of dollars. Manual inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that 81% of the sampled warnings do indeed lead to vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Volunteer Computing provision of seamless connectivity that enables convenient and rapid deployment of greener and cheaper computing infrastructure is extremely promising to complement next-generation distributed computing systems. Undoubtedly, without tactile Internet and secure VC ecosystems, harnessing its full potentials and making it an alternative viable and reliable computing infrastructure is next to impossible. Android-enabled smart devices, applications, and services are inevitable for Volunteer computing. Contrarily, the progressive developments of sophisticated Android malware may reduce its exponential growth. Besides, Android malwares are considered the most potential and persistent cyber threat to mobile VC systems. To secure Android-based mobile volunteer computing, the authors proposed MulDroid, an efficient and self-learning autonomous hybrid (Long-Short-Term Memory, Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Neural Network) multi-vector Android malware threat detection framework. The proposed mechanism is highly scalable with well-coordinated infrastructure and self-optimizing capabilities to proficiently tackle fast-growing dynamic variants of sophisticated malware threats and attacks with 99.01% detection accuracy. For a comprehensive evaluation, the authors employed current state-of-the-art malware datasets (Android Malware Dataset, Androzoo) with standard performance evaluation metrics. Moreover, MulDroid is compared with our constructed contemporary hybrid DL-driven architectures and benchmark algorithms. Our proposed mechanism outperforms in terms of detection accuracy with a trivial tradeoff speed efficiency. Additionally, a 10-fold cross-validation is performed to explicitly show unbiased results.",

    "abstract": "Callbacks are an effective programming discipline for implementing event-driven programming, especially in environments like Ethereum which forbid shared global state and concurrency. Callbacks allow a callee to delegate the execution back to the caller. Though effective, they can lead to subtle mistakes principally in open environments where callbacks can be added in a new code. Indeed, several high profile bugs in smart contracts exploit callbacks. We present the first static technique ensuring modularity in the presence of callbacks and apply it to verify prominent smart contracts. Modularity ensures that external calls to other contracts cannot affect the behavior of the contract. Importantly, modularity is guaranteed without restricting programming. In general, checking modularity is undecidable—even for programs without loops. This paper describes an effective technique for soundly ensuring modularity harnessing SMT solvers. The main idea is to define a constructive version of modularity using commutativity and projection operations on program segments. We believe that this approach is also accessible to programmers, since counterexamples to modularity can be generated automatically by the SMT solvers, allowing programmers to understand and fix the error. We implemented our approach in order to demonstrate the precision of the modularity analysis and applied it to real smart contracts, including a subset of the 150 most active contracts in Ethereum. Our implementation decompiles bytecode programs into an intermediate representation and then implements the modularity checking using SMT queries. Overall, we argue that our experimental results indicate that the method can be applied to many realistic contracts, and that it is able to prove modularity where other methods fail.",

Over the years, the scope of PEPM has expanded to include a variety of research areas centered around the theme of semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analysed, and transformed whilst establishing or maintaining important semantic properties. Relevant topics range from refactoring, partial evaluation, supercompilation, staged programming, fusion, and other meta-programming to model-driven development, program analysis, inductive programming, decompilation, program generation, and abstract interpretation.",

Despite its popularity in different domains, little is known about WebAssembly binaries that occur in the wild. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of 8,461 unique WebAssembly binaries gathered from a wide range of sources, including source code repositories, package managers, and live websites. We study the security properties, source languages, and use cases of the binaries and how they influence the security of the WebAssembly ecosystem. Our findings update some previously held assumptions about real-world WebAssembly and highlight problems that call for future research. For example, we show that vulnerabilities that propagate from insecure source languages potentially affect a wide range of binaries (e.g., two thirds of the binaries are compiled from memory unsafe languages, such as C and C++) and that 21% of all binaries import potentially dangerous APIs from their host environment. We also show that cryptomining, which once accounted for the majority of all WebAssembly code, has been marginalized (less than 1% of all binaries found on the web) and gives way to a diverse set of use cases. Finally, 29% of all binaries on the web are minified, calling for techniques to decompile and reverse engineer WebAssembly. Overall, our results show that WebAssembly has left its infancy and is growing up into a language that powers a diverse ecosystem, with new challenges and opportunities for security researchers and practitioners. Besides these insights, we also share the dataset underlying our study, which is 58 times larger than the largest previously reported benchmark.",

We have implemented this approach in Pumpkin Pi, an extension to the Pumpkin Patch Coq plugin suite for proof repair. We demonstrate Pumpkin Pi’s flexibility on eight case studies, including supporting a benchmark from a user study,easing development with dependent types, porting functions and proofs between unary and binary numbers, and supporting an industrial proof engineer to interoperate between Coq and other verification tools more easily.",

    "abstract": "Reducing a failure-inducing input to a smaller one is challenging for input with internal dependencies because most sub-inputs are invalid. Kalhauge and Palsberg made progress on this problem by mapping the task to a reduction problem for dependency graphs that avoids invalid inputs entirely. Their tool J-Reduce efficiently reduces Java bytecode to 24 percent of its original size, which made it the most effective tool until now. However, the output from their tool is often too large to be helpful in a bug report. In this paper, we show that more fine-grained modeling of dependencies leads to much more reduction. Specifically, we use propositional logic for specifying dependencies and we show how this works for Java bytecode. Once we have a propositional formula that specifies all valid sub-inputs, we run an algorithm that finds a small, valid, failure-inducing input. Our algorithm interleaves runs of the buggy program and calls to a procedure that finds a minimal satisfying assignment. Our experiments show that we can reduce Java bytecode to 4.6 percent of its original size, which is 5.3 times better than the 24.3 percent achieved by J-Reduce. The much smaller output is more suitable for bug reports.",

    "abstract": "Successful software authorship de-anonymization has both software forensics applications and privacy implications. However, the process requires an efficient extraction of authorship attributes. The extraction of such attributes is very challenging, due to various software code formats from executable binaries with different toolchain provenance to source code with different programming languages. Moreover, the quality of attributes is bounded by the availability of software samples to a certain number of samples per author and a specific size for software samples. To this end, this work proposes a deep Learning-based approach for software authorship attribution, that facilitates large-scale, format-independent, language-oblivious, and obfuscation-resilient software authorship identification. This proposed approach incorporates the process of learning deep authorship attribution using a recurrent neural network, and ensemble random forest classifier for scalability to de-anonymize programmers. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach over the entire Google Code Jam (GCJ) dataset across all years (from 2008 to 2016) and over real-world code samples from 1,987 public repositories on GitHub. The results of our work show high accuracy despite requiring a smaller number of samples per author. Experimenting with source-code, our approach allows us to identify 8,903 GCJ authors, the largest-scale dataset used by far, with an accuracy of 92.3%. Using the real-world dataset, we achieved an identification accuracy of 94.38% for 745 C programmers on GitHub. Moreover, the proposed approach is resilient to language-specifics, and thus it can identify authors of four programming languages (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Python), and authors writing in mixed languages (e.g., Java/C++, Python/C++). Finally, our system is resistant to sophisticated obfuscation (e.g., using C Tigress) with an accuracy of 93.42% for a set of 120 authors. Experimenting with executable binaries, our approach achieves 95.74% for identifying 1,500 programmers of software binaries. Similar results were obtained when software binaries are generated with different compilation options, optimization levels, and removing of symbol information. Moreover, our approach achieves 93.86% for identifying 1,500 programmers of obfuscated binaries using all features adopted in Obfuscator-LLVM tool.",

    "abstract": "Repackaging refers to the core process of unpacking a software package, then repackaging it after a probable modification to the decompiled code and/or to other resource files. In the case of repackaged malware, benign apps are injected with a malicious payload. Repackaged malware pose a serious threat to the Android ecosystem. Moreover, repackaged malware and benign apps share more than 80% of their features, which makes detection a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel technique based on multi-view learning to address this challenge of detecting repackaged malware. Multi-View Learning is a technique where data from multiple distinct feature groups, referred to as views, are fused to improve the model’s generalization performance. In the context of Android, we define views as different components of the app, such as permissions, APIs, sensor usage, etc. We analyzed 15,297 repackaged app pairs and extracted seven different views to represent an app. We perform an ablation study to identify which view(s) contribute more to the classification. The model was trained end-to-end to jointly learn appropriate features and to perform the classification. We show that our approach achieves accuracy and an F1-score of 97.46% and 0.98, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Mobile malware is growing in number and its complexity is constantly increasing. Malware authors are continuously looking new ways to elude anti-malware controls. Anti-malware are not able to detect zero-day malware, because to detect malicious behaviour they need to know its signature, but to have this information the malware must already be widespread. Furthermore, anti-malware are able to scan one application at a time: for this reason a type of malware characterized by the colluding attack, where the malicious action is split in two (or more) applications, can not be recognised. To demonstrate the ineffectiveness of current anti-malware mechanisms in recognizing colluding attacks, in this paper we propose Ste\\ae{}lErgon, a framework aimed to inject a malicious payload in two or more different Android applications. Clearly the malicious payload will be executed once all the applications composing the collusive attacks are installed into the infected device. In detail, Ste\\ae{}lErgon is able to inject a collusive malicious payload attacking the external storage, allowing the attacker to catch sensitive and private information stored into the infected device. We perform an experimental analysis by submitting the generated colluding application to different 79 anti-malware, by showing that current detection mechanism are not able to detect this kind of threat. To boost research in focusing the attention in colluding attacks we freely release Ste\\ae{}lErgon, is available for research purposes at the following url: https://github.com/vigimella/StealErgon.",

Its CPS translation generates λ-terms in which continuation composition is not expressed in terms of nested function calls, as is typical of other delimited-control operators, e.g. shift, but with function applications consuming a sequence of continuations one at a time, as if they formed a stack. We present a novel reduction theory for Moggi’s computational λ-calculus extended with shift0 and a control delimiter dollar, which models the capture of evaluation contexts in a fine-grained manner as an interaction between the let-expressions and the delimiter. We establish a connection between our reduction theory and the existing theories of shif0 and dollar. Moreover, we develop a CPS translation for our calculus along with a direct-style translation that together form a reflection, i.e. the translations preserve reductions and the direct-style translation is a right inverse of the CPS translation. This construction relies on the invariant that CPS root terms are in η-head-normal form. The results of this work could potentially be used for compiler optimisations and lead to a similar development for algebraic effects.",

    "abstract": "Binary code fingerprinting is crucial in many security applications. Examples include malware detection, software infringement, vulnerability analysis, and digital forensics. It is also useful for security researchers and reverse engineers since it enables high fidelity reasoning about the binary code such as revealing the functionality, authorship, libraries used, and vulnerabilities. Numerous studies have investigated binary code with the goal of extracting fingerprints that can illuminate the semantics of a target application. However, extracting fingerprints is a challenging task since a substantial amount of significant information will be lost during compilation, notably, variable and function naming, the original data and control flow structures, comments, semantic information, and the code layout. This article provides the first systematic review of existing binary code fingerprinting approaches and the contexts in which they are used. In addition, it discusses the applications that rely on binary code fingerprints, the information that can be captured during the fingerprinting process, and the approaches used and their implementations. It also addresses limitations and open questions related to the fingerprinting process and proposes future directions.",

    "abstract": "Decompilers are tools designed to recover a high-level language representation (typically in C code) from program binaries. Over the past five years, decompilers have improved enormously, not only in terms of the readability of the produced pseudocode, but also in terms of similarity of the recovered representation to the original source code. Albeit decompilers are routinely used by reverse engineers in different disciplines (e.g., to support vulnerability discovery or malware analysis), they are not yet adopted to produce input for source-code static analysis tools. In particular, source code vulnerability discovery and binary vulnerability discovery remain today two very different areas of research, despite the fact that decompilers could potentially bridge this gap and enable source-code analysis on binary files.In this paper, we conducted a number of experiments on real world vulnerabilities to evaluate the feasibility of this approach. In particular, our measurements are intended to show how the differences between original and decompiled code impact the accuracy of static analysis tools.Remarkably, our results show that in 71% of the cases, the same vulnerabilities can be detected by running the static analyzers on the decompiled code, even though for several cases we observe a steep increment in the number of false positives. To understand the reasons behind these differences, we manually investigated all cases and we identified a number of root causes that affected the ability of static tools to 'understand' the generated code.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, enormously Android malware poses a significant threat to Android platform security. To detect malicious applications, researchers have done a lot of work, in which finding and locating malicious code segments is an important research content. In the previous research, most detection methods cannot directly locate malicious code, and some methods with the locate ability can only find some specific types of malicious operations. This paper proposed a graph convolution algorithm and weighted mechanism to find malicious nodes implied in the Android application function call graph and provided a general method for malicious code location. We analyzed the sub-graph structural differences between benign code and malicious payload in the function call graph, constructed graph convolution operation to make the nodes in the graph learn the surrounding sub-graph structure, designed the weighting mechanism to set the malicious score to every code node, and filtered out the nodes with the highest malicious score to locate the malicious code fragments. On the dataset composed of 2650 malicious and 2650 benign applications, the accuracy of malware detection is 92.6%, and the accuracy of malicious code location is between 72.6% and 88.1%, indicating that our method is accurate and efficient.",

    "abstract": "Along the evolution of malware detection systems, adversaries develop sophisticated evasion techniques that render malicious samples undetectable. Especially for ML-based detection systems, an effective approach is to craft adversarial malware to evade detection. In this position paper, we conduct a critical review of existing adversarial attacks against malware detection, and conclude that current research focuses mainly on evasion techniques against static analysis; generating adversarial Windows samples to evade dynamic analysis remains largely unexplored. In the context of black-box attack scenarios, we investigate an adversary's potential to carry out practical transformations in order to influence behavioral features observed by ML systems and security products. Moreover, we investigate the range of dynamic behavior transformations and identify critical properties and associated challenges that relate to feasibility, automation, technical costs and detection risks. Through this discussion, we propose solutions to important challenges and present promising paths for future research on evasive malware under dynamic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a service (UAVaaS) has increased the field deployment of Robotic Aerial Vehicles (RAVs) for different services such as transportation and terrain exploration. These RAVs are controlled by firmware, which is often closed-source, developed by vendors, and flashed into the ROM. While these binary blobs enable off-the-shelf management of RAVs, end users (individuals or organizations) have no idea if the control firmware is designed and implemented correctly, and can only rely on firmware updates from vendors when any vulnerability is discovered. This paper proposes DisPatch, the first reverse engineering and patching framework for understanding and improving controller design and implementation within RAV firmware. DisPatch first decompiles binary instructions and recovers controller functions and core controller variables by combining control theory with program analysis using symbolic execution and data flow analysis. End users can then write a patch in a domain-specific language (DSL), which will be translated and injected into the binary firmware by DisPatch automatically. We have applied DisPatch to two instances of commodity firmware from3DR IRIS+ and MantisQ RAVs and demonstrated 100% and 80.7% accuracy respectively in the controller decompilation. We have also shown the ability to prevent severe controller performance degradation by patching two real-world bugs with in the firmware and without breaking other functionality. Finally, we show that DisPatch introduces less than 0.53% of space overhead and 1.48% of runtime overhead without violating the soft real-time deadlines. DisPatch provides the first step towards an RAV binary firmware reverse engineering and patching system to customize controller design and implementation.",

    "abstract": "Lifting binaries to a higher-level representation is an essential step for decompilation, binary verification, patching and security analysis. In this paper, we present the first approach to provably overapproximative x86-64 binary lifting. A stripped binary is verified for certain sanity properties such as return address integrity and calling convention adherence. Establishing these properties allows the binary to be lifted to a representation that contains an overapproximation of all possible execution paths of the binary. The lifted representation contains disassembled instructions, reconstructed control flow, invariants and proof obligations that are sufficient to prove the sanity properties as well as correctness of the lifted representation. We apply this approach to Linux Foundation and Intel’s Xen Hypervisor covering about 400K instructions. This demonstrates our approach is the first approach to provably overapproximative binary lifting scalable to commercial off-the-shelf systems. The lifted representation is exportable to the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, allowing formal verification of its correctness. If our technique succeeds and the proofs obligations are proven true, then – under the generated assumptions – the lifted representation is correct.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of new architectures create a recurring challenge to ensure that existing programs still work on them. Manually porting legacy code is often impractical. Static binary translation (SBT) is a process where a program’s binary is automatically translated from one architecture to another, while preserving their original semantics. However, these SBT tools have limited support to various advanced architectural features. Importantly, they are currently unable to translate concurrent binaries. The main challenge arises from the mismatches of the memory consistency model specified by the different architectures, especially when porting existing binaries to a weak memory model architecture. In this paper, we propose Lasagne, an end-to-end static binary translator with precise translation rules between x86 and Arm concurrency semantics. First, we propose a concurrency model for Lasagne’s intermediate representation (IR) and formally proved mappings between the IR and the two architectures. The memory ordering is preserved by introducing fences in the translated code. Finally, we propose optimizations focused on raising the level of abstraction of memory address calculations and reducing the number of fences. Our evaluation shows that Lasagne reduces the number of fences by up to about 65%, with an average reduction of 45.5%, significantly reducing their runtime overhead.",

    "abstract": "Edge computing is a recent computing paradigm that brings cloud services closer to the client. Among other features, edge computing offers extremely low client/server latencies. To consistently provide such low latencies, services should run on edge nodes that are physically as close as possible to their clients. Thus, when the physical location of a client changes, a service should migrate between edge nodes to maintain proximity. Differently from cloud nodes, edge nodes integrate CPUs of different Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), hence a program natively compiled for a given ISA cannot migrate to a server equipped with a CPU of a different ISA. This hinders migration to the closest node.We introduce H-Container, a system that migrates natively compiled containerized applications across compute nodes featuring CPUs of different ISAs. H-Container advances over existing heterogeneous-ISA migration systems by being (a) highly compatible – no user’s source-code nor compiler toolchain modifications are needed; (b) easily deployable – fully implemented in user space, thus without any OS or hypervisor dependency, and (c) largely Linux-compliant – it can migrate most Linux software, including server applications and dynamically linked binaries. H-Container targets Linux and its already-compiled executables, adopts LLVM, extends CRIU, and integrates with Docker. Experiments demonstrate that H-Container adds no overheads during program execution, while 10–100&nbsp;ms are added during migration. Furthermore, we show the benefits of H-Container in real-world scenarios, demonstrating, for example, up to 94% increase in Redis throughput when client/server proximity is maintained through heterogeneous container migration.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain greatly benefit from cutting-edge analysis techniques and pose significant challenges. A primary challenge is the extremely low-level representation of deployed contracts. We present Elipmoc, a decompiler for the next generation of smart contract analyses. Elipmoc is an evolution of Gigahorse, the top research decompiler, dramatically improving over it and over other state-of-the-art tools, by employing several high-precision techniques and making them scalable. Among these techniques are a new kind of context sensitivity (termed “transactional sensitivity”) that provides a more effective static abstraction of distinct dynamic executions; a path-sensitive (yet scalable, through path merging) algorithm for inference of function arguments and returns; and a fully context sensitive private function reconstruction process. As a result, smart contract security analyses and reverse-engineering tools built on top of Elipmoc achieve high scalability, precision and completeness. Elipmoc improves over all notable past decompilers, including its predecessor, Gigahorse, and the state-of-the-art industrial tool, Panoramix, integrated into the primary Ethereum blockchain explorer, Etherscan. Elipmoc produces decompiled contracts with fully resolved operands at a rate of 99.5% (compared to 62.8% for Gigahorse), and achieves much higher completeness in code decompilation than Panoramix—e.g., up to 67% more coverage of external call statements—while being over 5x faster. Elipmoc has been the enabler for recent (independent) discoveries of several exploitable vulnerabilities on popular protocols, over funds in the many millions of dollars.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of blockchain, automatically detecting vulnerabilities in smart contracts is becoming a significant problem. Prior research mainly identifies smart contract vulnerabilities without considering the interactions between multiple contracts. Due to the lack of analyzing the fine-grained contextual information during cross-contract invocations, existing approaches often produced a large number of false positives and false negatives. This paper proposes SmartDagger, a new framework for detecting cross-contract vulnerability through static analysis at the bytecode level. SmartDagger integrates a set of novel mechanisms to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency for cross-contract vulnerability detection. Particularly, SmartDagger effectively recovers the contract attribute information from the smart contract bytecode, which is critical for accurately identifying cross-contract vulnerabilities. Besides, instead of performing the typical whole-program analysis which is heavy-weight and time-consuming, SmartDagger selectively analyzes a subset of functions and reuses the data-flow results, which helps to improve its efficiency. Our further evaluation over a manually labelled dataset showed that SmartDagger significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art tools (i.e., Oyente, Slither, Osiris, and Mythril) for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities. In addition, running SmartDagger over a randomly selected dataset of 250 smart contracts in the real-world, SmartDagger detects 11 cross-contract vulnerabilities, all of which are missed by prior tools.",

    "abstract": "Background: With the boosting development of IoT technology, the supply chains of IoT devices become more powerful and sophisticated, and the security issues introduced by code reuse are becoming more prominent. Therefore, the detection and management of vulnerabilities through code similarity detection technology is of great significance for protecting the security of IoT devices. Aim: We aim to propose a more accurate, parallel-friendly, and realistic software supply chain vulnerability detection solution for IoT devices. Method: This paper presents PG-VulNet, standing for Vulnerability-detection Network based on Pseudo-code Graphs. It is a ”multi-model” cross-architecture vulnerability detection solution based on pseudo-code and Graph Matching Network (GMN). PG-VulNet extracts both behavioral and structural features of pseudo-code to build customized feature graphs and then uses GMN to detect supply chain vulnerabilities based on these graphs. Results: The experiments show that PG-VulNet achieves an average detection accuracy of 99.14%, significantly higher than existing approaches like Gemini, VulSeeker, FIT, and Asteria. In addition to this, PG-VulNet also excels in detection overhead and false alarms. In the real-world evaluation, PG-VulNet detected 690 known vulnerabilities in 1,611 firmwares. Conclusions: PG-VulNet can effectively detect the vulnerabilities introduced by software supply chain in IoT firmwares and is well suited for large-scale detection. Compared with existing approaches, PG-VulNet has significant advantages.",

    "abstract": "The Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is a rich language for modeling embedded systems through several constructs such as component extension and refinement to promote modularity of component declarations. To ease processing AADL models, OSATE, the reference tool for AADL, defines another model (namely 'instance' model) computed from a base 'declarative' model/s. An instance model is a simple object tree where all information from the declarative model is flattened so that tools can easily use this information to analyze the system. However for modifications, they have to make changes in the complex declarative model since there is no automated backward transformation (deinstantiation) from instance to declarative models. Since the instance model is a 'view' of the declarative model, this is a view-update problem. In this paper, we propose the OSATE Declarative-Instance Mapping Tool (OSATE-DIM1), an Eclipse plugin for deinstantiation of AADL models implementing a solution of this view-update problem. We evaluate OSATE-DIM with a benchmark of existing AADL model processing tools and verify the correctness of our deinstantiation transformations. We also discuss how our approach could be useful for decompilation of Object-Oriented languages' intermediate representations.",

Our key insight is that the knowledge of event-activity transitions from the previous testing runs, i.e., executing which events can reach which activities, is valuable for guiding the follow-up testing runs to quickly cover major app functionalities. To this end, we propose (1) a probabilistic model to memorize and leverage this knowledge during testing, and (2) design a model-based guided testing strategy (enhanced by a reinforcement learning algorithm). We implemented our technique as an automated testing tool named Fastbot2. The evaluation on two popular industrial apps (with billions of user installations), Douyin and Toutiao, shows that Fastbot2 outperforms the state-of-the-art testing tools (Monkey, Ape and Stoat) in both activity coverage and fault detection in the context of continuous testing. To date, Fastbot2 has been deployed in the CI pipeline at ByteDance for nearly two years, and 50.8% of the developer-fixed crash bugs were reported by Fastbot2, which significantly improves app quality. Fastbot2 has been made publicly available to benefit the community at: https://github.com/bytedance/Fastbot_Android.",

    "abstract": "More apps are published every day and the functionality of each app increases steadily as well. Consequently app analyses are often overwhelmed when confronted with up-to-date, real-world apps. One of the biggest issues originates from the scalability of analyses with respect to libraries. Analyses, more precisely the tools implementing them, cannot distinguish the app’s code from the code of a library. Always analyzing the whole code base is the result. However, this is usually not necessary, for example, when a security property is checked, trusted libraries must not be analyzed. We propose an approach to differentiate an app’s code from a library’s code. The approach is based on clone detection and implemented in our prototype APK-Simplifier. As the evaluation shows APK-Simplifier can be employed in a cooperative analysis to remove library code and to enhance arbitrary analysis tools’ scalability. In fact, five analysis tools have been enabled to analyze five up-to-date, real-world apps they could not analyze before. Still, it is alerting that the majority of such apps remains not analyzable as also shown during evaluation.",

    "abstract": "With the popularity of Android mobile devices and the increase of related applications, hackers regard it as the primary attack target. Therefore, malware detection is essential nowadays, and many of these studies employ deep learning techniques. In recent years, the attention mechanism provides corresponding attention weights for different hidden states, and it is widely used in many fields, such as machine translation and image markup. However, no research has applied the attention mechanism to Android malware analysis. Hence, this paper completes the goal of malware family classification based on the static features of Android applications. We compare the difference between the original convolutional neural network (CNN) and the addition of the attention mechanism. The final experimental results show that the attention mechanism improves the accuracy of the existing CNN model by 1.99% in static opcode images. In addition, we further adopt the occlusion sensitivity method to try to explain the classification model proposed in this paper. Finally, the experimental results of model interpretation show that the classification model can effectively identify the threat behavior of malware.",

    "abstract": "Manually writing parallel programs is difficult and error-prone.   Automatic parallelization could address this issue, but profitability can be limited by not having facts known only to the programmer.   A parallelizing compiler that collaborates with the programmer can increase the coverage and performance of parallelization while reducing the errors and overhead associated with manual parallelization.   Unlike collaboration involving analysis tools that report program properties or make parallelization suggestions to the programmer, decompiler-based collaboration could leverage the strength of existing parallelizing compilers to provide programmers with a natural compiler-parallelized starting point for further parallelization or refinement.  Despite this potential, existing decompilers fail to do this because they do not generate portable parallel source code compatible with any compiler of the source language.  This paper presents SPLENDID, an LLVM-IR to C/OpenMP decompiler that enables collaborative parallelization by producing standard parallel OpenMP code.   Using published manual parallelization of the PolyBench benchmark suite as a reference, SPLENDID's collaborative approach produces programs twice as fast as either Polly-based automatic parallelization or manual parallelization alone.   SPLENDID's portable parallel code is also more natural than that from existing decompilers, obtaining a 39x higher average BLEU score.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the new problem of hardware decompilation. Analogous to software decompilation, hardware decompilation is about analyzing a low-level artifact—in this case a netlist, i.e., a graph of wires and logical gates representing a digital circuit—in order to recover higher-level programming abstractions, and using those abstractions to generate code written in a hardware description language (HDL). The overall problem of hardware decompilation requires a number of pieces. In this paper we focus on one specific piece of the puzzle: a technique we call hardware loop rerolling. Hardware loop rerolling leverages clone detection and program synthesis techniques to identify repeated logic in netlists (such as would be synthesized from loops in the original HDL code) and reroll them into syntactic loops in the recovered HDL code. We evaluate hardware loop rerolling for hardware decompilation over a set of hardware design benchmarks written in the PyRTL HDL and industry standard SystemVerilog. Our implementation identifies and rerolls loops in 52 out of 53 of the netlists in our benchmark suite, and we show three examples of how hardware decompilation can provide concrete benefits: transpilation between HDLs, faster simulation times over netlists (with mean speedup of 6x), and artifact compaction (39% smaller on average).",

    "abstract": "While third-party libraries (TPLs) are extensively reused to enhance productivity during software development, they can also introduce potential security risks such as vulnerability propagation. Software composition analysis (SCA), proposed to identify reused TPLs for reducing such risks, has become an essential procedure within modern DevSecOps. As one of the mainstream SCA techniques, binary-to-source SCA identifies the third-party source projects contained in binary files via binary source code matching, which is a major challenge in reverse engineering since binary and source code exhibit substantial disparities after compilation. The existing binary-to-source SCA techniques leverage basic syntactic features that suffer from redundancy and lack robustness in the large-scale TPL dataset, leading to inevitable false positives and compromised recall. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce BinaryAI, a novel binary-to-source SCA technique with two-phase binary source code matching to capture both syntactic and semantic code features. First, BinaryAI trains a transformer-based model to produce function-level embeddings and obtain similar source functions for each binary function accordingly. Then by applying the link-time locality to facilitate function matching, BinaryAI detects the reused TPLs based on the ratio of matched source functions. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BinaryAI in terms of binary source code matching and the downstream SCA task. Specifically, our embedding model outperforms the state-of-the-art model CodeCMR, i.e., achieving 22.54% recall@1 and 0.34 MRR compared with 10.75% and 0.17 respectively. Additionally, BinaryAI outperforms all existing binary-to-source SCA tools in TPL detection, increasing the precision from 73.36% to 85.84% and recall from 59.81% to 64.98% compared with the well-recognized commercial SCA product Black Duck.https://www.binaryai.net",

    "abstract": "As an essential component in Ethereum and other blockchains, token assets have been interacted with by diverse smart contracts. Effective permission policies of smart contracts must prevent token assets from being manipulated by unauthorized adversaries. Recent efforts have studied the accessibility of privileged functions or state variables to unauthorized users. However, little attention is paid to how publicly accessible functions of smart contracts can be manipulated by adversaries to steal users' digital assets. This attack is mainly caused by the permission re-delegation (PRD) vulnerability. In this work, we propose PrettySmart, a bytecode-level Permission re-delegation vulnerability detector for Smart contracts. Our study begins with an empirical study on 0.43 million open-source smart contracts, revealing that five types of widely-used permission constraints dominate 98% of the studied contracts. Accordingly, we propose a mechanism to infer these permission constraints, as well as an algorithm to identify constraints that can be bypassed by unauthorized adversaries. Based on the identification of permission constraints, we propose to detect whether adversaries could manipulate the privileged token management functionalities of smart contracts. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PrettySmart, which achieves the highest precision score and detects 118 new PRD vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "Reentrancy, a notorious vulnerability in smart contracts, has led to millions of dollars in financial loss. However, current smart contract vulnerability detection tools suffer from a high false positive rate in identifying contracts with reentrancy vulnerabilities. Moreover, only a small portion of the detected reentrant contracts can actually be exploited by hackers, making these tools less effective in securing the Ethereum ecosystem in practice.In this paper, we propose BlockWatchdog, a tool that focuses on detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying attacker contracts. These attacker contracts are deployed by hackers to exploit vulnerable contracts automatically. By focusing on attacker contracts, BlockWatchdog effectively detects truly exploitable reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying reentrant call flow. Additionally, BlockWatchdog is capable of detecting new types of reentrancy vulnerabilities caused by poor designs when using ERC tokens or user-defined interfaces, which cannot be detected by current rule-based tools. We implement BlockWatchdog using cross-contract static dataflow techniques based on attack logic obtained from an empirical study that analyzes attacker contracts from 281 attack incidents. BlockWatchdog is evaluated on 421,889 Ethereum contract bytecodes and identifies 113 attacker contracts that target 159 victim contracts, leading to the theft of Ether and tokens valued at approximately 908.6 million USD. Notably, only 18 of the identified 159 victim contracts can be reported by current reentrancy detection tools.",

    "abstract": "The prosperous trend of deploying complex applications to web browsers has   boosted the development of WebAssembly (wasm) compilation toolchains. Software   written in different high-level programming languages are compiled into wasm   executables, which can be executed fast and safely in a virtual machine. The   performance of wasm executables depends highly on compiler optimizations.   Despite the prosperous use of wasm executables, recent research has indicated   that real-world wasm applications are slower than anticipated, suggesting   deficiencies in wasm optimizations.    This paper aims to present the first systematic and in-depth understanding of   the status quo of wasm optimizations. To do so, we present DITWO, a   differential testing framework to uncover missed optimizations   (MO) of wasm optimizers. DITWO compiles a C program into both   native x86 executable and wasm executable, and differentiates   optimization indication traces (OITraces) logged by running each   executable to uncover MO. Each OITrace is composed with global variable writes   and function calls, two performance indicators that practically and   systematically reflect the optimization degree across wasm and native   executables.   Our analysis of the official wasm optimizer, wasm-opt, successfully   identifies 1,293 inputs triggering MO of wasm-opt. With extensive manual effort, we  identify nine root causes for all MO, and we estimate that fixing discovered MO   can result in a performance improvement of at least 17.15%. We also summarize   four lessons from our findings to deliver better wasm optimizations.",

    "abstract": "DeFi protocols are programs that manage high-value digital assets on blockchain. The price manipulation vulnerability is one of the common vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols, which allows attackers to gain excessive profits by manipulating token prices. In this paper, we propose DeFiTainter, an inter-contract taint analysis framework for detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities. DeFiTainter features two innovative mechanisms to ensure its effectiveness. The first mechanism is to construct a call graph for inter-contract taint analysis by restoring call information, not only from code constants but also from contract storage and function parameters. The second mechanism is a high-level semantic induction tailored for detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities, which accurately identifies taint sources and sinks and tracks taint data across contracts. Extensive evaluation of real-world incidents and high-value DeFi protocols shows that DeFiTainter outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance with a precision of 96% and a recall of 91.3% in detecting price manipulation vulnerabilities. Furthermore, DeFiTainter uncovers three previously undisclosed price manipulation vulnerabilities.",

It poses a lot of threats for users, such as financial costs, privacy breaches, and remote control. It is more efficient to construct accurate models to detect Android malware. We propose a novel Android malware detection framework MGIDroid. It considers two modality feature representations at the same: the function call graph (FCG) and Dex bytecode image features of Android applications. First, we construct an FCG that describes the relations between function calls for an Android application. We use GraphSAGE with the SAGPool model to extract FCG features. Next, we convert Dalvik Executable files of Android applications to Dex bytecode image, Resnet model with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is adopted to extract image features that represent the data section of an Android application. Then, we use soft attention to fuse two modalities features to finish classification. Lastly, extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The results show that our proposed method outperforms other methods and achieves a high f1-score of 98.60%.",

In this paper, we propose JSLibD, an automated extraction method for third-party libraries in miniapps. Unlike conventional extraction methods that heavily rely on prior knowledge, JSLibD introduces a heuristic prediction approach, comprising two integral components: a whitelist matching method to match the known libraries and a heuristic prediction method to extract the unknown libraries using function call relationships. The results demonstrate that JSLibD can efficiently match known libraries, and accurately predict unknown libraries, achieving an impressive precision rate of 85.9% and a high recall rate of 97.2%.",

    "abstract": "The past few years have witnessed a boom of miniapps, as lightweight applications, miniapps are of great importance in the mobile internet sector. Consequently, the security of miniapps can directly impact compromising the integrity of sensitive data, posing a potential threat to user privacy. However, after a thorough review of the various research efforts in miniapp security, we found that their actions in researching the safety of miniapp web interfaces are limited. This paper proposes a triad threat model focusing on users, servers and attackers to mitigate the security risk of miniapps. By following the principle of least privilege and the direction of permission consistency, we design a novel analysis framework for the security risk assessment of miniapps by this model. Then, we analyzed the correlation between the security risk assessment and the threat model associated with the miniapp. This analysis led to identifying potential scopes and categorisations with security risks. In the case study, we identify nine major categories of vulnerability issues, such as SQL injection, logical vulnerabilities and cross-site scripting. We also assessed a total of 50,628 security risk hazards and provide specific examples.",

    "abstract": "Computing-in-Memory (CIM) architectures using Non-volatile Memories (NVMs) have emerged as a promising way to address the “memory wall” problem in traditional Von Neumann architectures. CIM accelerators can perform arithmetic or Boolean logic operations in NVMs by fully exploiting their high parallelism for bit-wise operations. These accelerators are often used in cooperation with general-purpose processors to speed up a wide variety of artificial neural network applications. In such a heterogeneous computing architecture, the legacy software should be redesigned and re-engineered to utilize new CIM accelerators. In this article, we propose a compilation tool to automatically migrate legacy programs to such heterogeneous architectures based on the low-level virtual machine (LLVM) compiler infrastructure. To accelerate some computations such as vector-matrix multiplication in CIM accelerators, we identify several typical computing patterns from LLVM intermediate representations, which are oblivious to high-level programming paradigms. Our compilation tool can modify accelerable LLVM IRs to offload them to CIM accelerators automatically, without re-engineering legacy software. Experimental results show that our compilation tool can translate many legacy programs to CIM-supported binary executables effectively, and improve application performance and energy efficiency by up to 51\\texttimes{} and 309\\texttimes{}, respectively, compared with general-purpose x86 processors.",

    "abstract": "Java bytecode is a quite high-level language and, as such, it is fairly easy to analyze and decompile with malicious intents, e.g., to tamper with code and skip license checks. Code obfuscation was a first attempt to mitigate malicious reverse-engineering based on static analysis. However, obfuscated code can still be dynamically analyzed with standard debuggers to perform step-wise execution and to inspect (or change) memory content at important execution points, e.g., to alter the verdict of license validity checks. Although some approaches have been proposed to mitigate debugger-based attacks, they are only applicable to binary compiled code and none address the challenge of protecting Java bytecode.In this article, we propose a novel approach to protect Java bytecode from malicious debugging. Our approach is based on automated program transformation to manipulate Java bytecode and split it into two binary processes that debug each other (i.e., a self-debugging solution). In fact, when the debugging interface is already engaged, an additional malicious debugger cannot attach. To be resilient against typical attacks, our approach adopts a series of technical solutions, e.g., an encoded channel is shared by the two processes to avoid leaking information, an authentication protocol is established to avoid Man-in-the-middle attacks, and the computation is spread between the two processes to prevent the attacker to replace or terminate either of them.We test our solution on 18 real-world Java applications, showing that our approach can effectively block the most common debugging tasks (either with the Java debugger or the GNU debugger) while preserving the functional correctness of the protected programs. While the final decision on when to activate this protection is still up to the developers, the observed performance overhead was acceptable for common desktop application domains.",

    "abstract": "Decompilation is a process of converting a low-level machine code snippet back into a high-level programming language such as C. It serves as a basis to aid reverse engineers in comprehending the contextual semantics of the code. In this respect, commercial decompilers like Hex-Rays have made significant strides in improving the readability of decompiled code over time. While previous work has proposed the metrics for assessing the readability of source code, including identifiers, variable names, function names, and comments, those metrics are unsuitable for measuring the readability of decompiled code primarily due to i) the lack of rich semantic information in the source and ii) the presence of erroneous syntax or inappropriate expressions. In response, to the best of our knowledge, this work first introduces R2I, the Relative Readability Index, a specialized metric tailored to evaluate decompiled code in a relative context quantitatively. In essence, R2I can be computed by i) taking code snippets across different decompilers as input and ii) extracting pre-defined features from an abstract syntax tree. For the robustness of R2I, we thoroughly investigate the enhancement efforts made by (non-)commercial decompilers and academic research to promote code readability, identifying 31 features to yield a reliable index collectively. Besides, we conducted a user survey to capture subjective factors such as one’s coding styles and preferences. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that R2I is a versatile metric capable of representing the relative quality of decompiled code (e.g., obfuscation, decompiler updates) and being well aligned with human perception in our survey.",

An attacker can trivially obtain the app, analyze its operation, and potentially eavesdrop on the wireless communication occurring during the setup phase. We develop a semi-automated general methodology involving off-the-shelf tools to examine information disclosure during the setup phase. We tested our methodology on twenty commodity-grade IoT devices. The outcome reveals a wide range of device-dependent choices for encryption at various layers and the potential for exposure of, among other things, device-identifying information and local networking (WiFi) credentials.

    "abstract": "Java decompilers are programs that perform the reverse process of Java compilers, i.e., they translate Java bytecode to Java source code. They are essential for reverse engineering purposes and have become more sophisticated and reliable over the years. However, it remains challenging for modern Java decompilers to reliably perform correct decompilation on real-world programs. To shed light on the key challenges of Java decompilation, this paper provides the first systematic study on the characteristics and causes of bugs in mature, widely-used Java decompilers. We conduct the study by investigating 333 unique bugs from three popular Java decompilers. Our key findings and observations include: (1) Although most of the reported bugs were found when decompiling large, real-world code, 40.2% of them have small test cases for bug reproduction; (2) Over 80% of the bugs manifest as exceptions, syntactic errors, or semantic errors, and bugs with source code artifacts are very likely semantic errors; (3) 57.7%,39.0%, and 41.1% of the bugs respectively are attributed to three stages of decompilers—loading structure entities from bytecode, optimizing these entities, and generating source code from these entities; (4) Bugs in decompilers’ type inference are the most complex to fix; and (5) Region restoration for structures like loop, sugaring for special structures like switch, and type inference of variables of generic types or indistinguishable types are the three most significant challenges in Java decompilation, which to some extent explains our findings in (3) and (4).Based on these findings, we present JD-Tester, a differential testing framework for Java decompilers, and our experience of using it in testing the three popular Java decompilers. JD-Tester utilizes different Java program generators to construct executable Java tests and finds exceptions, syntactic, and semantic inconsistencies (i.e. bugs) between a generated test and its compiled-decompiled version (through compilation and execution). In total, we have found 62 bugs in the three decompilers, demonstrating both the effectiveness of JD-Tester, and the importance of testing and validating Java decompilers.",

    "abstract": "Fuzzing is an effective method for detecting security bugs in software, and there have been quite a few effective works on fuzzing Android. Researchers have developed methods for fuzzing open-source native APIs and Java interfaces on actual Android devices. However, the realm of automatically fuzzing Android closed-source native libraries, particularly on emulators, remains insufficiently explored. There are two key challenges: firstly, the multi-language programming model inherent to Android; and secondly, the absence of a Java runtime environment within the emulator.                 To address these challenges, we propose Atlas, a practical automated fuzz framework for Android closed-source native libraries. Atlas consists of an automatic harness generator and a fuzzer containing the necessary runtime environment. The generator uses static analysis techniques to deduce the correct calling sequences and parameters of the native API according to the information from the \"native world\" and the \"Java world\". To maximize the practicality of the generated harness, Atlas heuristically optimizes the generated harness. The Fuzzer provides the essential Java runtime environment in the emulator, making it possible to fuzz the Android closed-source native libraries on a multi-core server. We have tested Atlas on 17 pre-installed apps from four Android vendors. Atlas generates 820 harnesses containing 767 native APIs, of which 78% is practical. Meanwhile, Atlas has discovered 74 new security bugs with 16 CVEs assigned. The experiments show that Atlas can efficiently generate high-quality harnesses and find security bugs.",

    "abstract": "In software security tasks like malware analysis and vulnerability mining, reverse engineering is pivotal, with C decompilers playing a crucial role in understanding program semantics. However, reverse engineers still predominantly rely on assembly code rather than decompiled code when analyzing complex binaries. This practice underlines the limitations of current decompiled code, which hinders its effectiveness in reverse engineering. Identifying and analyzing the problems of existing decompilers and making targeted improvements can effectively enhance the efficiency of software analysis. In this study, we systematically evaluate current mainstream decompilers’ semantic consistency and readability. Semantic evaluation results show that the state-of-the-art decompiler Hex-Rays has about 55% accuracy at almost all optimization, which contradicts the common belief among many reverse engineers that decompilers are usually accurate. Readability evaluation indicates that despite years of efforts to improve the readability of the decompiled code, decompilers’ template-based approach still predominantly yields code akin to binary structures rather than human coding patterns. Additionally, our human study indicates that to enhance decompilers’ accuracy and readability, introducing human or compiler-aware strategies like a speculate-verify-correct approach to obtain recompilable decompiled code and iteratively refine it to more closely resemble the original binary, potentially offers a more effective optimization method than relying on static analysis and rule expansion.",

    "abstract": "Jump tables are a common source of indirect jumps in binary code. Resolving these indirect jumps is critical for constructing a complete control-flow graph, which is an essential first step for most applications involving binaries, including binary hardening and instrumentation, binary analysis and fuzzing for vulnerability discovery, malware analysis and reverse engineering. Existing techniques for jump table analysis generally prioritize performance over soundness. While lack of soundness may be acceptable for applications such as decompilation, it can cause unpredictable runtime failures in binary instrumentation applications. We therefore present SJA, a new jump table analysis technique in this paper that is sound and scalable. Our analysis uses a novel abstract domain to systematically track the \"structure\" of computed code pointers without relying on syntactic pattern-matching that is common in previous works. In addition, we present a bounds analysis that efficiently and losslessly reasons about equality and inequality relations that arise in the context of jump tables. As a result, our system reduces miss rate by 35\\texttimes{} over the next best technique. When evaluated on error rate based on F1-score, our technique outperforms the best previous techniques by 3\\texttimes{}.",

When it is obfuscated to avoid detection, making it harder to repack and classify. State-of-the-art Android repackaged app classification approaches heavily rely on manually extracting dependency features as fingerprints. In this paper, we present a novel Android app repackaging classification method that utilizes the proposed EDA model to learn the semantic and sequence context information from smali embedding. It is extracted automatically from decompiled android .smali files. We leverage the high-frequency attention of embedding encoding to quickly identify public library subsequences. And our model uses intra-sequence attention for encoding between opcode embeddings within each .smali file to capture richer embedding encoding vectors. We make experiments on 8,000 android app pairs downloaded by Androzoo dataset. The results demonstrate that our method achieves 87.53% accuracy for repackaged apps classification. It can effectively capture context between sequences, and exhibits better training and detection efficiency than time series-based deep neural network learning model.",

Symbolization is a decompilation step that enables binary patching: functions can be modified, and instructions can be interspersed. Moreover, it is the first abstraction step in a larger decompilation chain. The produced NASM is recompilable, and we extensively test the recompiled binaries to see if they exhibit the same behavior as the original ones. In addition to testing, the produced NASM is accompanied with a certificate, constructed in such a way that if all theorems in the certificate hold, symbolization has occurred correctly. The original and recompiled binary are lifted again with a third-party decompiler (Ghidra). These representations, as well as the certificate, are loaded into the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, where proof scripts ensure that correctness can be proven automatically. We have applied symbolization to various stripped binaries from various sources, from various compilers, and ranging over various optimization levels. We show how symbolization enables binary-level patching, by tackling challenges originating from industry.",

This study addresses this gap by conducting a large-scale analysis of TEE utilization in Android applications, focusing on the key areas of cryptography, digital rights management, biometric authentication, and secure dialogs. To facilitate our extensive analysis, we introduce Mobsec Analytika, a framework tailored for large-scale app examinations, which we make available to the research community. Through 333,475 popular Android apps, our analysis illuminates the implementation of TEE-related features and their contextual usage. Our findings reveal that TEE features are predominantly utilized indirectly through third-party libraries, with only 6.2% of apps directly invoking the APIs. Moreover, the study reveals the underutilization of the recent TEE-based UI feature Protected Confirmation.",

While static analysis of ELF binaries is necessarily limited by the theoretical undecidability of control-flow and data-flow analysis algorithms, we detail a new approach to reverse engineering through selective concrete execution of arbitrary functions within a x86_64 GNU/Linux binary by transforming ELF applications into shared libraries. This approach, named \"procedural debugging\", allows us to empirically recover information about function parameters and return values without resorting to any disassembly or decompilation, which are undecidable in general. In turn, this dynamic approach may be used as a feedback loop into existing program analyzers, being them static, fuzzing, symbolic, or concolic, to enrich their understanding of application interfaces. We publish an open-source framework, named the Witchcraft Compiler Collection, under a permissive MIT/BSD license, implementing binary libification, procedural debugging, and automatic function prototype annotations with the hope of benefiting the security community.",

    "abstract": "Writing distributed applications is hard, as the programmer needs to describe the communication protocol between the different endpoints. If this is not done correctly, we can introduce bugs such as deadlocks and data races.  Tierless and choreographic programming models aim to make this easier by describing the interactions of every endpoint in a single compilation unit. When such a program is compiled, ideally, a single endpoint is projected and the code for the other endpoints is removed. This leads to smaller binaries with fewer dependencies, and is called program partitioning. In this pearl, we show how we can use rewrite rules and specialisation to get GHC to partition our Haskell programs (almost) for free, if they are written using the Haste App or HasChor framework.  As an example of why partitioning is useful, we show how an example application can be more easily built and deployed after being partitioned.",

    "abstract": "Specifying and implementing a proof system from scratch requires significant effort. Logical Frameworks and Higher Order Logic Programming Languages provide dedicated, high-level meta languages to facilitate this task in two ways: 1) variable binding and substitution are for free when meta language binders represent object logic ones; 2) proof construction, and proof search, are greatly simplified by leveraging the unification procedure provided by the meta language. Notable examples of meta languages are Elf&nbsp;[21], Twelf&nbsp;[23], λ Prolog&nbsp;[16], Beluga&nbsp;[24], Abella&nbsp;[8] and Isabelle&nbsp;[31] which have been used to implement or specify many formal systems such as First Order Logic&nbsp;[5], Set Theory&nbsp;[20], Higher Order Logic&nbsp;[19], and the Calculus of Constructions&nbsp;[4]. The object logic we are interested in is Coq’s type theory&nbsp;[28]. We aim to develop a higher-order unification-based proof search procedure using the meta language Elpi&nbsp;[3], a dialect of λ Prolog. Elpi’s equational theory includes βη -equivalence and features a higher-order unification procedure ≃ m for the pattern fragment&nbsp;[15]. Elpi offers an encoding of Coq terms that is suitable for meta programming&nbsp;[6, 9, 26, 27] but that restricts ≃ m to first-order unification problems only. We refer to this basic encoding as &lt;Formula format=\"inline\"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX $mathcal {O}$?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 1&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name=\"ppdp2024-1-inline1\" type=\"svg\"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt;.

Moreover, as ≃ o delegates most of the work to ≃ m, it can be used to efficiently simulate a logic program in &lt;Formula format=\"inline\"&gt;&lt;TexMath&gt;&lt;?TeX $mathcal {O}$?&gt;&lt;/TexMath&gt;&lt;AltText&gt;Math 5&lt;/AltText&gt;&lt;File name=\"ppdp2024-1-inline5\" type=\"svg\"/&gt;&lt;/Formula&gt; by taking advantage of unification-related optimizations of the meta language, such as clause indexing.",

More than depending on any tool capability, malware analysis tasks depend on human analysts’ abilities, experiences, and practices when using the tools. Academic research has traditionally been focused on producing solutions to overcome malware analysis technical challenges, but are these solutions adopted in practice by malware analysts? Are these solutions useful? If not, how can the academic community improve its practices to foster adoption and cause a greater impact? To answer these questions, we surveyed 21 professional malware analysts working in different companies, from CSIRTs to AV companies, to hear their opinions about existing tools, practices, and the challenges they face in their daily tasks. In 31 questions, we cover a broad range of aspects, from the number of observed malware variants to the use of public sandboxes and the tools the analysts would like to exist to make their lives easier. We aim to bridge the gap between academic developments and malware practices. To do so, on the one hand, we suggest to the analysts the solutions proposed in the literature that could be integrated into their practices. On the other hand, we also point out to the academic community possible future directions to bridge existing development gaps that significantly affect malware analysis practices.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, the threat of malware has become increasingly evident, posing a significant risk to cybersecurity worldwide and driving extensive research efforts to prevent and mitigate these attacks. Despite numerous efforts to automate malware analysis, these systems are constantly thwarted by evasive techniques developed by malware authors. As a result, the analysis of sophisticated evasive malware falls into the hands of human malware analysts, who must undertake the time-consuming process of overcoming each evasive technique to uncover malware’s malicious behaviors. This highlights the need for approaches that aid malware analysts in this process. Although active measures, such as forced execution and symbolic analysis, can automatically circumvent some evasive checks, they suffer from limitations like path explosion and fail to provide useful insights that analysts can use in their workflow. To fill this gap, we investigate how large language models (LLMs) can address shortcomings of symbolic analysis through the first comparative analysis between the two in bypassing evasion techniques. Our study leads to three key findings: (i) we find that LLMs outperform symbolic analysis in bypassing evasive code, especially in the presence of common code patterns, such as loops, which have historically posed a challenge for symbolic analysis, (ii) we show that LLMs correctly identify methods of bypassing evasive techniques in real-world malware, and (iii) we highlight how even in LLMs failure modes, human malware analysts can benefit from the step-by-step reasoning provided by the model.",

    "abstract": "Since funds or tokens in smart contracts are maintained through specific state variables, contract audit, an effective means for security assurance, particularly focuses on these variables and their related operations. However, the absence of publicly accessible source code for numerous contracts, with only bytecode exposed, hinders audit efforts. Recovering variables and their types from Solidity bytecode is thus a critical task in smart contract analysis and audit, yet this is a challenging task because the bytecode loses variable and type information, only with low-level data operated by stack manipulations and untyped memory/storage accesses. The state-of-the-art smart contract decompilers miss identifying many variables and incorrectly infer the types for many identified variables. To this end, we propose VarLifter, a lifter dedicated to the precise and efficient recovery of typed variables. VarLifter interprets every read or written field of a data region as at least one potential variable, and after discarding falsely identified variables, it progressively refines the variable types based on the variable behaviors in the form of operation sequences. We evaluate VarLifter on 34,832 real-world Solidity smart contracts. VarLifter attains a precision of 97.48% and a recall of 91.84% for typed variable recovery. Moreover, VarLifter finishes analyzing 77% of smart contracts in around 10 seconds per contract. If VarLifter is used to replace the variable recovery modules of the two state-of-the-art Solidity bytecode decompilers, 52.4%, and 74.6% more typed variables will be correctly recovered, respectively. The applications of VarLifter to contract decompilation, contract audit, and contract bytecode fuzzing illustrate that the recovered variable information improves many contract analysis tasks.",

    "abstract": "Patch presence test is critical in software security to ensure that binary files have been patched for known vulnerabilities. It is challenging due to the semantic gap between the source code and the binary, and the small and subtle nature of patches. In this paper, we propose React, the first patch presence test approach on IR-level. Based on the IR code compiled from the source code and the IR code lifted from the binary, we first extract four types of feature (return value, condition, function call, and memory store) by executing the program symbolically. Then, we refine the features from the source code and rank them. Finally, we match the features to determine the presence of a patch with an SMT solver to check the equivalence of features at the semantic level.To evaluate our approach, we compare it with state-of-the-art approaches, BinXray and PS3, on a dataset containing binaries compiled from different compilers and optimization levels. Our experimental results show that React achieves scores of 0.88, 0.98, and 0.93, in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively. React outperforms the baselines by 39% and 12% in terms of the F1 score, while the testing speed of our approach is 2x faster than BinXray and 100x faster than PS3. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study to evaluate the effectiveness of each component in React, which shows that SMT solver and refinement can contribute to 16% and 10% improvement in terms of the F1 score, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of pre-trained models (PTMs) and datasets has led to the emergence of centralized model hubs like Hugging Face, which facilitate collaborative development and reuse. However, recent security reports have uncovered vulnerabilities and instances of malicious attacks within these platforms, highlighting growing security concerns. This paper presents the first systematic study of malicious code poisoning attacks on pre-trained model hubs, focusing on the Hugging Face platform. We conduct a comprehensive threat analysis, develop a taxonomy of model formats, and perform root cause analysis of vulnerable formats. While existing tools like Fickling and ModelScan offer some protection, they face limitations in semantic-level analysis and comprehensive threat detection. To address these challenges, we propose MalHug, an end-to-end pipeline tailored for Hugging Face that combines dataset loading script extraction, model deserialization, in-depth taint analysis, and heuristic pattern matching to detect and classify malicious code poisoning attacks in datasets and models. In collaboration with Ant Group, a leading financial technology company, we have implemented and deployed MalHug on a mirrored Hugging Face instance within their infrastructure, where it has been operational for over three months. During this period, MalHug has monitored more than 705K models and 176K datasets, uncovering 91 malicious models and 9 malicious dataset loading scripts. These findings reveal a range of security threats, including reverse shell, browser credential theft, and system reconnaissance. This work not only bridges a critical gap in understanding the security of the PTM supply chain but also provides a practical, industry-tested solution for enhancing the security of pre-trained model hubs.",

    "abstract": "Android apps extensively collect sensitive personal data from our devices daily. Despite stringent regulations like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), many applications (apps) fail to comply with these legal requirements. While previous studies have focused on the compliance of privacy policies, checking how these policies are implemented in the actual code has not yet been extensively investigated. Moreover, previous efforts have often been limited in scope.This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the challenge of verifying privacy regulation compliance in Android apps. Specifically, we address scenarios where source code is unavailable by investigating whether LLM can work with Smali code—a human-readable representation of Android byte-code extracted from APK files. Through this exploratory investigation, we aim to uncover if LLMs can bridge the gap between legal privacy requirements and their technical implementation in mobile apps. Through initial experiments, we assess the feasibility and effectiveness of a straightforward LLM-driven method for identifying compliance issues and provide directions for our future research efforts to improve our approach and perform large-scale experiments.",

    "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are tools used by humans to enhance the way they perform tasks. CPSs make tasks more efficient, more precise, and safer. Those systems are omnipresent in human lives, e.g., in cars with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for self-balancing or even in medical devices. CPSs can read information from the real world, process it, and affect the real world back, considering constraints such as real-time processing. Furthermore, the safety and security of the software controlling the CPS are directly linked with the safety and security of human bystanders. The European Union (EU) has a process to assess the conformity of specific products exchanged within the EU to ensure the safety of its citizens. Recently, regulations and directives such as the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) pressed European actors to provide compliant software products. Requirements on software started with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2017. However, technical requirements are challenging to understand from legal texts, and certification processes rely solely on manufacturer documentation. On the one hand, the EU has difficulty monitoring and opening the European market to products deemed compliant. On the other hand, manufacturers have difficulty understanding what is technically required of them when introducing products. This thesis aims to reconcile both parties.",

Despite a multitude of malware detection systems, skilled developers of malicious software adeptly conceal harmful code within applications, thus eluding standard detection techniques. A significant challenge in Android application reverse engineering is the extraction of critical code from \".so\" files, known as native code, which is often viewed as a secure and clandestine strategy in Android development. Addressing this challenge, our research introduces a novel Android malware detection approach that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to scrutinize native code opcodes. By decompressing Android Application Packages (APKs) and extracting opcodes from shared libraries, we utilize the tf-idf algorithm for feature selection, facilitating the detection of obscured malicious code in a static analysis context. This methodology, bolstered by LSTM training, constructs a formidable framework for Android malware detection. Our empirical assessments confirm the method's effectiveness and superiority in detecting Android malware.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity attacks on embedded devices for industrial control systems and cyber-physical systems may cause catastrophic physical damage as well as economic loss. This could be achieved by infecting device binaries with malware that modifies the physical characteristics of the system operation. Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but offer little semantic insight. This article proposes the REMaQE automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or pointers, and can reverse engineer equations from object-oriented implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool “tmon.” To evaluate REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations. Real-time execution enables integration in an interactive math-oriented reverse engineering workflow.",

    "abstract": "React Native, an open source framework, simplifies cross-platform app development by allowing JavaScript-side code to interact with native-side code. Previous studies disregarded React Native, resulting in insufficient static analysis of React Native app code. This study initiates the investigation of challenges when statically analyzing React Native apps. We propose ReuNify to improve Soot-based static analysis coverage for JavaScript-side and native-side code. ReuNify converts Hermes bytecode to Soot’s intermediate representation. Hermes bytecode, compiled from JavaScript code and integrated into React Native apps, possesses a unique syntax that eludes current JavaScript analyzers. Additionally, we investigate opcode distribution and conduct in-depth analyses of the usage of opcode between popular apps and malware. We also propose a benchmark consisting of 97 control flow-related cases to validate the control flow recovery of the generated intermediate representation. Furthermore, we model the cross-language communication mechanisms of React Native to expand the static analysis coverage for native-side code. Our evaluation demonstrates that ReuNify enables an average increase of 84% in reached nodes within the callgraph and further identifies an average of two additional privacy leaks in taint analysis. In summary, this article demonstrates that ReuNify significantly improves the static analysis for the React Native Android apps.",

However, there are still several notable limitations. First, GKAT is completely agnostic with respect to the meaning of primitives, to keep equivalence decidable. Second, GKAT excludes non-local control flow such as goto, break, and return. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Control-Flow GKAT (CF-GKAT), a system that allows reasoning about programs that include non-local control flow as well as hardcoded values. CF-GKAT is able to soundly and completely verify trace equivalence of a larger class of programs, while preserving the nearly-linear efficiency of GKAT. This makes CF-GKAT suitable for the verification of control-flow manipulating procedures, such as decompilation and goto-elimination. To demonstrate CF-GKAT’s abilities, we validated the output of several highly non-trivial program transformations, such as Erosa and Hendren’s goto-elimination procedure and the output of Ghidra decompiler. CF-GKAT opens up the application of Kleene Algebra to a wider set of challenges, and provides an important verification tool that can be applied to the field of decompilation and control-flow transformation.",

Cama specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics—consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance—enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison.We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use Cama to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis.",

In particular, we evaluated GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Flash and Gemini in Android Studio and we found that GPT-4o outperforms Google's models, demonstrating higher accuracy and robustness across a range of violations types. Hence, with this dataset, we aim to provide valuable insights for advancing APR research and improving tools for Android security.",

    "abstract": "The current landscape of binary code summarization predominantly focuses on generating a single summary, which limits its utility and understanding for reverse engineers. Existing approaches often fail to meet the diverse needs of users, such as providing detailed insights into usage patterns, implementation nuances, and design rationale, as observed in the field of source code summarization. This highlights the need for multi-intent binary code summarization to enhance the effectiveness of reverse engineering processes. To address this gap, we propose MiSum, a novel method that leverages multi-modality heterogeneous code graph alignment and learning to integrate both assembly code and pseudo-code. MiSum introduces a unified multi-modality heterogeneous code graph (MM-HCG) that aligns assembly code graphs with pseudo-code graphs, capturing both low-level execution details and high-level structural information. We further propose multi-modality heterogeneous graph learning with heterogeneous mutual attention and message passing, which highlights important code blocks and discovers inter-dependencies across different code forms. Additionally, an intent-aware summary generator with an intent-aware attention mechanism is introduced to produce customized summaries tailored to multiple intents. Extensive experiments, including evaluations across various architectures and optimization levels, demonstrate that MiSum outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L metrics. Human evaluations validate its capability to effectively support reverse engineers in understanding diverse binary code intents, marking a significant advancement in binary code analysis.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of Python has spurred interest in decompiling Python PYC bytecode. This work presents the first large-scale study on human-assisted Python decompilation in the wild, leveraging extensive data from pylingual.io, spanning 181,646 PYC binaries, 9,003 user-submitted patches, and 393 accuracy-verified patches. We investigate how reverse engineers respond to inaccurate decompilation and identify factors influencing their efforts to achieve accurate decompilation. We complement this unprecedented observational data with a controlled user study that isolates the technical difficulty of patching imperfect Python decompilations.By contrasting real-world patching behavior with that of the controlled setting, we discover that reversers' decision to repair a decompilation result is more strongly driven by the semantic content of the program (e.g., malware binaries or malicious tools) than by the technical difficulty of the patch. That is, a reverser's motivation is more important than their expertise.Our study reveals common patterns observed in the patching process, including how users approached the patching task, the types of errors they encountered, and the strategies they employed to resolve them. We also examine the strengths and limitations of assistive tools in the pursuit of perfect decompilation. Our findings offer unique insights into the practical dynamics of human-decompiler interaction, providing actionable recommendations for integrating human intelligence into the decompilation workflow and demonstrating the research potential of reliable decompilation accuracy verification.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are proprietary assets due to the expertise, confidential data, and high development costs involved in model training. Well-trained DNN models are compiled into DNN binaries to be efficiently executed on various platforms, such as edge devices and cloud infrastructures. Recent research on DNN binary decompilation shows the potential of stealing DNN models via binary reverse engineering techniques. While obfuscation is a well-studied technique to hamper binary reverse engineering, general obfuscation schemes are not designed for this new type of binary and have limitations in concealing information within DNN binaries due to the unique characteristics of DNN binaries. In this paper, we show that existing reverse engineering attacks on DNN binaries can recover 98.5% of DNN operators from DNN binaries that have been obfuscated using general obfuscators. We then propose new obfuscation schemes tailored for DNN binaries, namely, (1) Flexible Operator Fusion; (2) Fake Operator Insertion; and (3) Operator Computation Reordering. We implement our dedicated obfuscation schemes as an end-to-end obfuscation toolchain called NeuroShield. Experiments show that NeuroShield is resilient to existing model reverse engineering attacks while introducing a reasonable overhead. Specifically, NeuroShield reduces the operator recovery rate to 3.03% for CV models and 47.18% for NLP models. Moreover, it has comparable binary size overhead and significantly lower execution time overhead (7.8% - 36.1%) compared to OLLVM, one of the commonly used general obfuscators.",

    "abstract": "Binary lifting is a key component in binary analysis tools.        In order to guarantee the correctness of binary lifting,        researchers have proposed various formally verified lifters.        However, such formally verified lifters have too strict requirements on binary,        which do not sufficiently reflect real-world lifters. In addition, real-world lifters use heuristic-based assumptions to lift binary code, which makes it difficult to guarantee the correctness of the lifted code using formal methods. In this paper, we propose a new interpretation of the correctness of real-world binary lifting.        We formalize the process of binary lifting with heuristic-based assumptions used in real-world lifters by dividing it into a series of transformations, where each transformation represents a lift with new abstraction features.        We define the correctness of each transformation as filtered-simulation, which is a variant of bi-simulation, between programs before and after transformation.        We present three essential transformations in binary lifting and formalize them: (1) control flow graph reconstruction, (2) abstract stack reconstruction, and (3) function input/output identification.        We implement our approach for x86-64 Linux binaries, named FIBLE, and demonstrate that it can correctly lift Coreutils and CGC datasets compiled with GCC.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Batteryless Things revolutionizes sustainable communication as it operates on harvested energy. This harvested energy is dependent on unpredictable environmental conditions; therefore, device operations, including those of its networking stack, must be resilient to power failures. Reactive intermittent computing provides an approach for solving this by notifications of impending power failures, which is implemented by monitoring the harvested energy buffered in a capacitor. However, to use this power-failure notification and guarantee forward progress, systems must break down tasks into atomic transactions that can be predictably finished before the energy runs out. Thus, static program-code analysis must determine the worst-case energy consumption (WCEC) of all transactions. In Wi-Fi--capable devices, drivers are often closed-source, which avoids the determination of WCEC bounds for transactions since static analysis requires all code along with its semantics.In this work, we integrate an energy-aware networking stack with reverse-engineered Wi-Fi drivers to enable full-stack WCEC analysis for physical transmission and reception of packets. Further, we extended a static worst-case analysis tool with a resource-consumption model of our Wi-Fi driver. Our evaluation with the RISC-V--based ESP32-C3 platform gives worst-case bounds with our static analysis approach for the transactions of the full communication stack, therefore showing that Wi-Fi--based reactive intermittent computing is feasible.",

    "abstract": "Amid the ongoing escalation of anti-worker and anti-player practices across the game industry, the creative practices of developers are shifting: jammers, students, hobbyists, fangamers, and other digital game “zinesters” [3] seek to reclaim game design as a personal art form. This paper examines the emergence and rise of speculative game design communities on itch.io—sites of ongoing creative resistance to corporate encroachment and exclusionary game culture. Specifically, the study documents the activities of “anti-game” jammers and fantasy console development communities on itch.io—two groups that create speculative games (that is, projects that are conceptual, arbitrary, and materially or procedurally unrealizable) to make space for personal play that is divested from mainstream engines, markets, and pretenses of game commodity: 1) Firstly, “anti-game” designers use game jams, zines, and Discord servers to develop and circulate not-games, games that refuse play, and games that cannot be played. These makers create provocative thought experiments, poems, manifestos, and other “unplayable” works that resist hyper-capitalist investment in bigger, longer, more graphically precise, live-service, metaversal, forever-games. 2) Simultaneously, developers on itch build projects for fantasy consoles—such as PICO-8 and Bitsy—and imagine hardware that is mutually-constituted, rooted in community, and decommodified. Ultimately, this paper argues that speculative design practices divest from concerns of “playability,” center unencumbered participation, and allow developers to envision and participate in a post-capitalist imaginary of hardware, software, and play.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, malware has increasingly become a significant concern in information and technology security, as evidenced by the substantial rise in attacks on various devices, including computers, the internet, and mobile devices. Detecting zero-day malware has become a primary focus for security researchers. Given that Google’s Android is one of the most widely used mobile operating systems, attackers have shifted their attention to creating malware specifically targeting Android. Numerous security researchers have employed various machine learning algorithms to detect these new Android and other types of malware. In this paper, we propose a system which employs a hybrid approach of analysis to better detect malware.The proposed model relies on a two-way approach in order to detect malwares in android application. This two-way approach first involves running the target APK through a static analytical model, If the result from the first stage comes out to be malicious, then the APK does not go to the second stage for further analysis. But, if the result from the first stage comes out to be benign, it is sent for further analysis by involving hybrid analysis (static + dynamic approach). The results given by the second stage will be ultimately determining whether the APK given is malicious or benign. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Hurry-sh/CCNCS-Project",

    "abstract": "Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.",

    "abstract": "Decompilation of binary code has arisen as a highly-important application in the space of Ethereum VM (EVM) smart contracts. Major new decompilers appear nearly every year and attain popularity, for a multitude of reverse-engineering or tool-building purposes. Technically, the problem is fundamental: it consists of recovering high-level control flow from a highly-optimized continuation-passing-style (CPS) representation. Architecturally, decompilers can be built using either static analysis or symbolic execution techniques. We present Shrnkr, a static-analysis-based decompiler succeeding the state-of-the-art Elipmoc decompiler. Shrnkr manages to achieve drastic improvements relative to the state of the art, in all significant dimensions: scalability, completeness, precision. Chief among the techniques employed is a new variant of static analysis context: shrinking context sensitivity. Shrinking context sensitivity performs deep cuts in the static analysis context, eagerly “forgetting” control-flow history, in order to leave room for further precise reasoning. We compare Shrnkr to state-of-the-art decompilers, both static-analysis- and symbolic-execution-based. In a standard benchmark set, Shrnkr scales to over 99.5% of contracts (compared to ∼95% for Elipmoc), covers (i.e., reaches and manages to decompile) 67% more code than Heimdall-rs, and reduces key imprecision metrics by over 65%, compared again to Elipmoc.",

    "abstract": "Since its extensive implementation in 2006, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) has supplanted traditional BIOS as the industry standard, serving as an essential link between computer hardware and operating systems. UEFI's advantageous role in system design provides it with comprehensive access to system resources, beyond those of the operating system kernel. Consequently, detecting and thoroughly characterizing memory corruption vulnerabilities in UEFI firmware is essential for preserving the integrity and security of computer systems. The techniques for finding UEFI firmware vulnerabilities nowadays mostly face two main difficulties: First of all, the special character of UEFI firmware makes direct dynamic examination inside the operating system especially difficult; Second, conventional fuzzing techniques lead to ineffective testing with their shallow knowledge of UEFI input structures. We propose a novel approach combining static analysis with fuzzing techniques to help to reduce these limits. Our approach starts with static reverse engineering to fully understand the structural characteristics of inputs throughout several UEFI interfaces, followed by cross-validation against open-source firmware implementations. We then use this structured knowledge to guide the seed file mutation technique, hence improving the accuracy and efficiency of fuzzing activities.",

    "abstract": "WebAssembly (Wasm) has emerged as a powerful binary format, enabling the seamless integration of languages like C and Rust into web applications. JavaScript (JS), the dominant language for client-side web development, has its code susceptible to tampering and intellectual property theft due to its transparency in browser environments. We introduce TranspileJS, a novel tool designed to enhance code security by automatically selecting and translating JS snippets into Wasm. TranspileJS leverages a multi-stage architecture that converts JS to TypeScript, which is compiled into Wasm using the AssemblyScript compiler. TranspileJS addresses the challenges posed by the fundamental differences between JS and Wasm, including dynamic typing, runtime behaviour mismatches, and standard library discrepancies, ensuring that the original behaviour of the code is preserved while maximising the amount of code transpiled. Our experiments show that TranspileJS successfully transpiles approximately one-third of the code in our dataset, with a performance impact of up to a 12.3% increase in execution time. The transpilation process inherently obfuscates code, creating effects similar to standard obfuscation techniques, and generates a stealthy and resilient output. Furthermore, combining transpilation with WebAssembly-specific obfuscation techniques opens new possibilities for code protection and resistance against reverse engineering.",

    "abstract": "Decompilation is the process of translating low-level, machine-executable code back into a high-level representation. Decompilers–tools that perform this translation–are essential for reverse engineers and security professionals, supporting critical tasks within their workflows. However, due to the inherent loss of information during compilation as a result of optimizations, inlining, and other compiler-specific transformations, decompiled output is often incomplete or inaccurate.A central challenge in decompilation is accurate type inference: the reconstruction of high-level type information for variables based on low-level code patterns and memory access behaviors. Despite ongoing advancements in decompilation research, there is a notable lack of comprehensive comparative studies evaluating the type inference capabilities of existing decompilers.This paper presents a benchmark study of five decompilers, focusing on their ability to infer types at both the function and variable levels. We conduct the evaluation on a dataset of binaries compiled from the Nixpkgs collection at both -O0 and -O2 optimization levels, allowing us to assess decompiler performance across unoptimized and optimized executables. The results highlight the relative strengths and weaknesses of each decompiler and identify recurring scenarios in which incorrect type information is produced.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, blockchain technology has developed rapidly and received widespread attention. However, its pseudonymous and decentralized nature has also attracted many criminal activities. Ponzi schemes, a kind of classic financial scam, also hide their true face in smart contracts, causing massive financial losses to blockchain users. Although several methods have been proposed to detect Ponzi contracts, there are still limitations in broad applicability, semantics understanding, and adversarial robustness. In this article, we propose PonziHunter, an intelligent framework for hunting Ponzi contracts on Ethereum. To tackle the problem of broad applicability, we train a detection model that does not require expert experience based on publicly available on-chain bytecode and off-chain contract labels. To tackle the problem of semantics understanding, we employ cross-function control flows and state variable dependencies to understand the logic of Ponzi contracts. Specifically, we decompile bytecodes into higher-order representations to analyze control flows and state variable dependencies and model the information as graph data. By combining the idea of code slicing, we identify the basic blocks related to Ponzi contract recognition. To tackle the problem of adversarial robustness, we model Ponzi contract recognition as a graph classification problem based on contrastive pre-training. We propose a data augmentation method for control flow graphs (CFGs), which preserves the basic blocks related to Ponzi contract recognition as much as possible during data perturbation. Experimental results show that PonziHunter outperforms state-of-the-art tools with average improvements of at least 4.77% on real-world ground-truth data and can newly discover 85 Ponzi contracts in the wild. More importantly, PonziHunter is robust against adversarial examples and can locate the critical basic blocks for smart Ponzi detection.",

    "abstract": "Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) serves as a foundational technique for binary analysis tasks such as vulnerability detection and malware identification. Existing graph based BCSA approaches capture more binary code semantics and demonstrate remarkable performance. However, when code obfuscation is applied, the unstable control flow structure degrades their performance. To address this issue, we develop ORCAS, an Obfuscation-Resilient BCSA model based on Dominance Enhanced Semantic Graph (DESG). The DESG is an original binary code representation, capturing more binaries' implicit semantics without control flow structure, including inter-instruction relations (e.g., def-use), inter-basic block relations (i.e., dominance and post-dominance), and instruction-basic block relations. ORCAS takes binary functions from different obfuscation options, optimization levels, and instruction set architectures as input and scores their semantic similarity more robustly. Extensive experiments have been conducted on ORCAS against eight baseline approaches over the BinKit dataset. For example, ORCAS achieves an average 12.1% PR-AUC improvement when using combined three obfuscation options compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, an original obfuscated real-world vulnerability dataset has been constructed and released to facilitate a more comprehensive research on obfuscated binary code analysis. ORCAS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches over this newly released real-world vulnerability dataset by up to a recall improvement of 43%.",

    "abstract": "Unlike code generation, which involves creating code from scratch, code completion focuses on integrating new lines or blocks of code into an existing codebase. This process requires a deep understanding of the surrounding context, such as variable scope, object models, API calls, and database relations, to produce accurate results. These complex contextual dependencies make code completion a particularly challenging problem. Current models and approaches often fail to effectively incorporate such context, leading to inaccurate completions with low acceptance rates (around 30%). For tasks like data transfer, which rely heavily on specific relationships and data structures, acceptance rates drop even further. This study introduces CCCI, a novel method for generating context-aware code completions specifically designed to address data transfer tasks. By integrating contextual information, such as database table relationships, object models, and library details into Large Language Models (LLMs), CCCI improves the accuracy of code completions. We evaluate CCCI using 289 Java snippets, extracted from over 819 operational scripts in an industrial setting. The results demonstrate that CCCI achieved a 49.1% Build Pass rate and a 41.0% CodeBLEU score, comparable to state-of-the-art methods that often struggle with complex task completion.",

This article presents a taxonomy categorizing and describing the main techniques used to secure Android applications. Additionally, we analyze the available software tools designed to aid developers in protecting their applications, as well as their prevalence in the wild using a longitudinal dataset comprising nearly 2.5 million apps, including malicious software, pre-installed applications, and regular market application. Our key findings show that, although the use of software protection techniques has been steadily increasing over the last decade, they are still used only by a small fraction of applications in the Android ecosystem.

    "abstract": "The complexities introduced by compiler optimization have long stood as a significant obstacle in binary analysis and reverse engineering. Function inlining, in particular, complicates function recognition by replacing function calls with the entire body of the callee, mixing code from multiple functions. State-of-the-art approaches can identify inlined functions at basic block granularity, but cannot determine which instructions belong to each function and precisely deduce inlined boundaries. Without this information, further analyses such as decompilation cannot be performed effectively. This article presents Highliner, a novel approach that improves state-of-the-art approaches by identifying inline instances at instruction-level granularity. Highliner operates downstream of block-level detectors: given basic blocks reported by state-of-the-art approaches as belonging to a specific inlined function, it labels each instruction as Inlined or Not inlined and recovers the inlined-function boundaries. We treat the problem as a sequence tagging task typical of NLP and implement a learning-based technique involving instruction embedding and recurrent neural networks. We compile a dataset of open-source projects with different optimizations and use the DWARF debug information standard to construct labeled sequences of inline instructions. We use this dataset to train, validate, and test a sequence labeling architecture in which instructions are encoded via the pre-trained assembly language transformer PalmTree and then processed by an RNN-based classifier to produce binary predictions. When evaluated as a binary classifier, Highliner achieves an F1-score of 0.94 overall. In addition, when specifically tested on recognizing function boundaries, Highliner achieves an Accuracy of 0.82 on initial boundaries and 0.83 on final boundaries.",

To address this, we introduce codealign,1 a novel instruction-level code equivalence technique designed for neural decompilers.

We show how codealign generates equivalence alignments, then evaluate codealign by comparing it with symbolic execution.

In this paper, we propose a method of control flow obfuscation using the InvokeDynamic instruction with native call site bootstrapping. The proposed method prevents JVM byte-code from leaking call site information in function invocations. We evaluate the proposed technique against a series of benchmarks comparing original software with its obfuscated form. To this end, we observe an insignificant difference in application running time.",

    "abstract": "Today’s Internet of Things (IoT) environments are heterogeneous as they are typically comprised of devices equipped with various CPU architectures and software platforms. Therefore, in defending IoT environments against security threats, the capability of crossarchitecture vulnerability detection is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose BinX, a deep learning-based approach for code similarity detection in binaries that are obtained through different compilers and optimization levels for various architectures. Our research is guided by a key idea that involves leveraging the Ghidra decompiler to generate the decompiled C code and the high p-code intermediate representation and pre-train transformerbased model, specifically BERT and CodeBERT, to accurately generate semantic embeddings. These embeddings are then utilized as inputs to an RNN Siamese neural network, enhancing the learning process for code similarity detection. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through several experiments and comparisons with existing methods. Our results showcase the potential of BinX in enabling cross-architecture vulnerability detection in cross-architecture cross-compiled binaries, contributing to the advancement of security in IoT environments.",

    "abstract": "JNI programs are widely used thanks to the combined benefits of C and Java programs. However, because understanding the interaction behaviors between two different programming languages is challenging, JNI program development is difficult to get right and vulnerable to security attacks. Thus, researchers have proposed static analysis of JNI program source code to detect bugs and security vulnerabilities in JNI programs. Unfortunately, such source code analysis is not applicable to compiled JNI programs that are not open-sourced or open-source JNI programs containing third-party binary libraries. While JN-SAF, the state-of-the-art analyzer for compiled JNI programs, can analyze binary code, it has several limitations due to its symbolic execution and summary-based bottom-up analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to statically analyze compiled JNI programs without their source code using binary decompilation. Unlike JN-SAF that analyzes binaries directly, our approach decompiles binaries and analyzes JNI programs with the decompiled binaries using an existing JNI program analyzer for source code. To decompile binaries to compilable C source code with precise JNI-interoperation-related types, we improve an existing decompilation tool by leveraging the characteristics of JNI programs. Our evaluation shows that the approach is precise as almost the same as the state-of-the-art JNI program analyzer for source code, and more precise than JN-SAF.",

To solve this problem, code obfuscation techniques are applied to smart contracts to improve their complexity and security.

Therefore, we propose a novel bytecode obfuscation approach called BOSC based on four kinds of bytecode obfuscation techniques, which is directed at solidity.

    "abstract": "With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has been paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various educational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on blockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by developers for its “event-triggered” mechanism for building education intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified, so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly, the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG) are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the vulnerability detection of smart contracts. Compared with the traditional approaches, it can get good results with fewer layers of the GCN model, which shows that the contract bytecode and GCN model are efficient in vulnerability detection.",

Replacing these instructions with another more complex order or with different instructions with the same meaning without changing the result of the program will change the logic of the original instructions without affecting the result of the operation, which is the core principle of code obfuscation. In the compilation process, before the compiler compiles the code into the target machine code, it will transform the code into a kind of intermediate code, and then generate the target code after Control Flow Flattening and string encryption obfuscation of the intermediate code, which will make the decompilation work more difficult, thus realizing a code obfuscation system, and through some test cases, the effectiveness and feasibility of the system is demonstrated.",

    "abstract": "Binary reverse engineering is used to understand and analyse programs for which the source code is unavailable. Decompilers can help, transforming opaque binaries into a more readable source code-like representation. Still, reverse engineering is difficult and costly, involving considering effort in labelling code with helpful summaries. While the automated summarisation of decompiled code can help reverse engineers understand and analyse binaries, current work mainly focuses on summarising source code, and no suitable dataset exists for this task. In this work, we extend large pre-trained language models of source code to summarise de-compiled binary functions. Further-more, we investigate the impact of input and data properties on the performance of such models. Our approach consists of two main components; the data and the model. We first build CAPYBARA, a dataset of 214K decompiled function-documentation pairs across various compiler optimisations. We extend CAPYBARA further by removing identifiers, and deduplicating the data. Next, we fine-tune the CodeT5 base model with CAPYBARA to create BinT5. BinT5 achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU-4 score of 60.83, 58.82 and, 44.21 for summarising source, decompiled, and obfuscated decompiled code, respectively. This indicates that these models can be extended to decompiled binaries successfully. Finally, we found that the performance of BinT5 is not heavily dependent on the dataset size and compiler optimisation level. We recommend future research to further investigate transferring knowledge when working with less expressive input formats such as stripped binaries.",

    "abstract": "Smart contract decompilers, converting smart contract bytecode into smart contract source code, have been used extensively in many scenarios such as binary code analysis, reverse engineering, and security studies. However, existing studies, as well as industrial engineering practices, all assumed that smart contract decompilers are reliable and trustworthy, to generate correct and semantically equivalent source code from binaries. Unfortunately, whether such an assumption truly holds in practice is still unknown.In this paper, we conduct, to the best of our knowledge, the first and most comprehensive large-scale empirical study of smart contract decompilers, to gain an understanding of the reliability, limitations, and remaining research challenges of state-of-the-art smart contract decompilation tools. We first designed and implemented a software prototype SOLINSIGHT, then used it to study 5 state-of-the-art smart contract decompilers. We obtained important findings and insights from empirical results, such as: 1) we proposed 3 root causes leading to decompiler failures; 2) we revealed 2 reasons hurting performance; 3) we identified 3 root causes affecting decompilation effectiveness; 4) we proposed a measurement metric for completeness; and 5) we investigated the resilience of contract decompilers against program transformations. We suggest that: 1) decompiler builders should enhance decompilers in terms of effectiveness, performance, and completeness; and 2) security researchers should select appropriate decompilers based on the suggestions in this study. We believe these findings and suggestions will help decompiler builders, contract developers, and security researchers, by providing better guidelines for contract decompiler studies.",

    "abstract": "Obfuscation techniques are widely used to protect the digital copyright and intellectual property rights of software. Among them, code virtualization is one of the most powerful obfuscation techniques, which hides both the control flow and the data flow of the code, thereby preventing code from being decompiled. However, existing code virtualization solutions are not well-resistant to de-obfuscation techniques (e.g., symbolic execution and frequency analysis), and only target limited program languages and architectures, which are challenging to integrate into the process of software development and maintenance.In this paper, We propose an LLVM-based code virtualization tool, namely xVMP to fulfill a scalable and virtualized instruction-hardened obfuscation. To mask the effects of multiple program languages and architectures, xVMP incorporates the obfuscation process of code virtualization into the compilation, and generates virtualized code based on LLVM intermediate representation (IR). After virtualization, it embeds the interpreter of virtualized code into the IR and compiles to an executable. To enhance the security, xVMP encrypts virtualized instructions in each basic block and decrypts them at runtime to enhance the security of obfuscation. In addition, it supports specified function obfuscation. xVMP identifies the function annotations marked by the developer in the source code to locate the function to protect. We implement the prototype of xVMP, and evaluate it with a microbenchmark and three real-world programs. The experimental results show that xVMP can be more difficult to crack than the state-of-the-art obfuscators, and it can support more source code types and architectures, and can be applied to real-world software.

    "abstract": "Extensible static checking tools, such as Sys and CodeQL, have successfully discovered bugs in source code. These tools allow analysts to write application-specific rules, referred to as queries. These queries can leverage the domain knowledge of analysts, thereby making the analysis more accurate and scalable. However, the majority of these tools are inapplicable to binary-only analysis. One exception, joern, translates a binary code into decompiled code and feeds the decompiled code into an ordinary C code analyzer. However, this approach is not sufficiently precise for symbolic analysis, as it overlooks the unique characteristics of decompiled code. While binary analysis platforms, such as angr, support symbolic analysis, analysts must understand their intermediate representations (IRs) although they are mostly working with decompiled code.In this paper, we propose a precise and scalable symbolic analysis called fearless symbolic analysis that uses intuitive queries for binary code and implement this in QueryX. To make the query intuitive, QueryX enables analysts to write queries on top of decompiled code instead of IRs. In particular, QueryX supports callbacks on decompiled code, using which analysts can control symbolic analysis to discover bugs in the code. For precise analysis, we lift decompiled code into our IR named DNR and perform symbolic analysis on DNR while considering the characteristics of the decompiled code. Notably, DNR is only used internally such that it allows analysts to write queries regardless of using DNR. For scalability, QueryX automatically reduces control-flow graphs using callbacks and ordering dependencies between callbacks that are specified in the queries. We applied QueryX to the Windows kernel, the Windows system service, and an automotive binary. As a result, we found 15 unique bugs including 10 CVEs and earned $180,000 from the Microsoft bug bounty program.",

    "abstract": "Decompilation is a crucial capability in forensic analysis, facilitating analysis of unknown binaries. The recent rise of Python malware has brought attention to Python decompilers that aim to obtain source code representation from a Python binary. However, Python decompilers fail to handle various binaries, limiting their capabilities in forensic analysis.This paper proposes a novel solution that transforms a decompilation error-inducing Python binary into a decompilable binary. Our key intuition is that we can resolve the decompilation errors by transforming error-inducing code blocks in the input binary into another form. The core of our approach is the concept of Forensically Equivalent Transformation (FET) which allows non-semantic preserving transformation in the context of forensic analysis. We carefully define the FETs to minimize their undesirable consequences while fixing various error-inducing instructions that are difficult to solve when preserving the exact semantics. We evaluate the prototype of our approach with 17,117 real-world Python malware samples causing decompilation errors in five popular decompilers. It successfully identifies and fixes 77,022 errors. Our approach also handles anti-analysis techniques, including opcode remapping, and helps migrate Python 3.9 binaries to 3.8 binaries.",

    "abstract": "Android has been a constant target of cybercriminals that try to attack one of the most used operating systems, commonly using malicious applications (denominated malware) that, once installed on a device, can harm users in several ways. Existing malware detection solutions are usually invasive as they obtain classification features by performing reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of the analyzed application, which infringes licenses and terms of use of applications. In addition, these solutions often employ a single machine learning (ML) model to detect various types of malware, resulting in several false alarms. In this context, we propose an approach to detect Android malware consisting of a set of specific-type detectors in which each one performs a multi-stage analysis, based on rules and ML techniques, in different phases of the application cycle (before and after its installation). Our approach also differs from state-of-the-art solutions by being non-invasive, since it leverages a process to obtain application’s features that does not infringe licenses and terms of use of applications. In addition, according to experiments performed on a real Android smartphone, our proposal presents the following additional advantages over state-of-the-art solutions: a more efficient process to classify applications that is three times faster and requires ten times less CPU usage in some cases (saving device energy); and a better detection performance, with higher balanced accuracy, nine times less false positive cases, and ten times less false negative cases.",

    "abstract": "Microcode provides an abstraction layer over the instruction set to decompose complex instructions into simpler micro-operations that can be more easily implemented in hardware. It is an essential optimization to simplify the design of x86 processors. However, introducing an additional layer of software beneath the instruction set poses security and reliability concerns. The microcode details are confidential to the manufacturers, preventing independent auditing or customization of the microcode. Moreover, microcode patches are signed and encrypted to prevent unauthorized patching and reverse engineering. However, recent research has recovered decrypted microcode and reverse-engineered read/write debug mechanisms on Intel Goldmont (Atom), making analysis and customization of microcode possible on a modern Intel microarchitecture. In this work, we present the first framework for static and dynamic analysis of Intel microcode. Building upon prior research, we reverse-engineer Goldmont microcode semantics and reconstruct the patching primitives for microcode customization. For static analysis, we implement a Ghidra processor module for decompilation and analysis of decrypted microcode. For dynamic analysis, we create a UEFI application that can trace and patch microcode to provide complete microcode control on Goldmont systems. Leveraging our framework, we reverse-engineer the confidential Intel microcode update algorithm and perform the first security analysis of its design and implementation. In three further case studies, we illustrate the potential security and performance benefits of microcode customization. We provide the first x86 Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) microcode implementation and its security evaluation, design and implement fast software breakpoints that are more than 1000x faster than standard breakpoints, and present constant-time microcode division, illustrating the potential security and performance benefits of microcode customization.",

BiAn protects contracts by obfuscating data flows, control flows, and code layouts, increasing complexity and making it harder for attackers to discover vulnerabilities. Our experiments with buggy contracts showed an average complexity enhancement of approximately 174% after obfuscation.

    "abstract": "The issues related to SolarWinds attacks point out a large concern with modern software development projects in that there are fundamental flaws with existing security infrastructure. The purpose of this research is to investigate to what extent can the SootDiff analysis tool, a bytecode comparison tool, be used to determine if an application has been tampered with by comparing a known good version with a version that is unknown. The compiled and decompiled bytecodes as Jimple representations were compared to analyze the unique differences in identifying code tempering. The results showed that the scope of the variable is important in whether the change was detected. Variables with a scope that was entirely contained within one method could have their names changed without triggering a warning, but global variables to objects could not. The parameter variable and the local variable behave differently. Since the parameter is in the publicly available part of the method Java treats it the same way as it does the global variable. The local variable is strictly private to the method and not made available to the outside. Such findings can support the analysis tool which is useful for identifying potential breaches to detect meaningful changes in code even if it is decompiled.",

    "abstract": "Most of the time, cybercriminals look for new ways to bypass security controls by improving their attacks. In the 1980s, attackers developed malware to kidnap user data by requesting payments. Malware is called a ransomware. Recently, they have demanded payment in Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency. Ransomware is one of the most dangerous threats on the Internet, and this type of malware could affect almost all devices. Malware cipher device data, making them inaccessible to users. In this study, a new method for Android ransomware classification was proposed. This method implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for malware classification based on images. This paper presents a novel method for transforming an Android Application Package (APK) into a grayscale image. The image creation relies on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text cleaning and Fuzzy Hashing to represent the decompiled code from the APK in a set of hashes after preprocessing using NLP techniques. The image is composed of  $n$  fuzzy hashes that represent the APK. The method was tested using a dataset of 7,765 Android ransomware samples obtained from external researchers and public sources. The accuracy of the proposed method was higher than that of other methods in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Familiar analysis for malware plays an important role in comprehending the diversity of malicious behaviors and identifying the emerging security threats. Existing studies mainly focus on classifying malware into known families by supervised learning. However, these methods face two main challenges, 1) the lack of a large amount of labeled data and 2) the poor effectiveness in identifying unknown families of malware. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called multiple features (MulFC) based on unsupervised learning. In the method, we first leverage a decompiling tool to extract multiple features, including manifest features, application programming interface (API) features, and opcode features. Then, the opcode features are preprocessed to filter out the redundant ones to reduce the calculation cost. After that, we adopt the Jaccard index to calculate the similarities between malware and construct a malware network. Finally, InfoMap is applied to perform the clustering on the basis of the malware network. Overall, MulFC does not require the use of labeled data and can identify unknown families of malware. Experiments are conducted on two datasets for the performance evaluation of MulFC. The experimental results show that MulFC achieves 0.810 in terms of normalized mutual information, 0.576 in terms of adjusted rand index, 0.620 in terms of the Fowlkes–Mallows index, and 0.805 in terms of V-measure on average, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline method by 0.060, 0.054, 0.038, and 0.065, respectively.",

The REXA VM, which can virtualize embedded systems and sensor nodes and includes a general machine learning framework that supports arbitrary dynamic artificial neural network and decision tree models, is introduced in this study. The models are delivered as text files with highly compressed program code that are enclosed in code frames with embedded data (model parameters). The VM offers fundamental computations for ANN and DT models (Microservices). Using a decompiler, models can be updated (retrained) and sent to other nodes (mobile models). It can be demonstrated that virtualization using a bytecode machine and just-in-time compiler is still appropriate and effective for extremely low-resource processors.",

    "abstract": "Open source code reuse and code cross-platform deployment accelerate the spread of software vulnerabilities, and pose challenges for accurate detection of cross-platform vulnerabilities. The binary vulnerability similarity detection method based on machine learning lacks a fine-grained vulnerability similarity feature filtering mechanism, and cannot solve cross-function vulnerabilities triggered by data dependencies, resulting in a high vulnerability false positive rate in existing solutions, which limits practical applications. Software code vulnerabilities are usually caused by function key statements. Therefore, based on binary function decompilation, we identify the key statement that causes the vulnerability, analyze the cross-function data dependency of the key statements, extract the code similarity features and code vulnerability features of the key statements, and propose a feature filtering-based Binary vulnerability detection method SimFilter. SimFilter calculates the similarity of key statements by comparing the characteristics of function key statements, and infers the similarity of binary function vulnerabilities based on the similarity of key statements. The experimental results show that the vulnerability semantic features extracted by SimFilter are highly interpretable, and the accuracy rate is increased by 10.8% compared with other models. At the same time, we analyzed and evaluated the impact of different similarity features on the accuracy of SimFilter, and gave the best empirical value of the SimFilter model in firmware vulnerability detection.",

IPFS ensures that contract code does not change by using content/hash-based addressing. The address of the file can be passed between nodes to recreate the files locally as long as nodes are running an IPFS node as well. In this implementation, we design the model to work with an existing prototype blockchain which was built with IPFS integration. The use of Python to write the code helps ensure transparency as the code does not need to be compiled and thus would not need to be run through a decompiler to make deployed code human-readable.

As such, the security of the internal control logic of the PLCs is the top concern of ICS. Reversing analysis and forensic work against PLC require extracting control logic from the control application running inside PLC, which is still an unresolved problem. To address the challenge, we propose a PLC decompile framework named CLEVER, which can analyze the control application and extract the control logic. First, we propose a simulation execution based code extraction method, which is utilized to filter the control logic related data. Then, to normalize the control application decompile process, an intermediate representation (IR) is designed, which can simplify the analysis process and enhance the extensibility of CLEVER. Finally, a heuristic data flow analysis algorithm is proposed to find variable dependency, and a sequential parsing method is utilized to reconstruct the source code from the control application. To evaluate our work, real world PLC hardware and programming software are used for the experiment. We use 22 real-world, 58 hand-written, and 150 auto-generated control applications to demonstrate the usability, correctness, and operational efficiency of CLEVER.",

    "abstract": "Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in industrial control systems (ICS) run a control logic program to monitor and control critical infrastructures in real-time, such as nuclear plants and power grids. Attackers target PLC control logic remotely to sabotage or disrupt physical processes. Network intrusion detection systems (IDS) are increasingly used to detect malicious control logic. This paper demonstrates that standard IDS features in a protocol message header and payload are not resilient for detecting (control logic) binary programs, such as entropy, n-gram, and decompilation. It identifies and utilizes a PLC design feature, redundant address pins (RAP), unexplored in the literature, to bypass IDS for injecting a small piece of programmable malicious code (PMC) into a PLC's control logic as an initial attack vector, allowing it to execute with every scan cycle. We propose three unique attack methods (GizmoSplit, BuffWarp, and EnigmaFlow) using PMC as a proof of concept that blends control logic with network traffic via payload encoding, small-size payloads, or sparse memory addressing. The GizmoSplit attack divides the control logic into small gadgets and writes them in random memory locations in a PLC; PMC modifies the stack with the location of the gadgets to execute them as return-oriented programming. The BuffWarp attack employs a small-size buffer where the attacker writes malicious code periodically to bypass stateful inspection at the payload level; PMC, in turn, keeps moving the buffer content to consecutive memory locations to execute. The EnigmaFlow attack encodes control logic and sends it to a PLC's typically unused memory region, which PMC decodes and executes. The evaluation results indicate that these attacks are stealthy and can subvert IDS utilizing standard message header and payload features. This work points to a research gap in intrusion detection that caters to control logic attacks exploiting PLC design features.",

Identifying inline functions in the binary code is additionally challenging as there is no clear boundary between an inlined function and its caller function, the instructions of the same function might differ during inline expansion, and existing graph-schema methods for inline function identification cannot handle the vast number of functions involved due to their complexity. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose an effective inline function identification solution named ReIFunc, which combines subgraph isomorphism and deep learning to identify these recurring inline functions (RIFs). Our evaluation shows that ReIFunc can effectively match functions within a broad candidate set with a high precision rate exceeding 99% while maintaining an acceptable recall, thus getting rid of the constraints imposed by the limited size of the candidate set.",

The method involves extracting key functions from Android applications, decompiling them into Smali code, and then trans-forming them into C++ code. This code is virtualized at compile time and repackaged into a new APK file, offering a more efficient reinforcement approach compared to traditional methods. It uses less computational power and storage while meeting the high safety standards of 5G technology. This approach is particularly effective against automated, low-threshold reverse engineering tools, which have challenged previous hardening methods. In our experiments, we analyzed six common Android shell tools on enhanced applications, demonstrating the ineffectiveness of these tools against our method. Our reinforcement overcomes the easy recovery issue of traditional methods and shows strong resistance to general reverse-engineering tools. We evaluated the performance pre- and post-hardening in terms of CPU utilization, size, and runtime memory usage. For instance, CPU utilization post-hardening increased by 0.9% for Gaud Map, 4.8% for WPS, and 1.3 % for public comments. The use of native Layer code and function localization enhances program efficiency, offsetting the performance overhead of fusion, thus maintaining overall performance stability. Our method's robustness against common reverse-engineering tools, with minimal impact on CPU usage, application size, and memory usage, confirms its practicality for deployment in the 5G ecosystem.",

The inferring sequence will be f made up by logic analysis again.

    "abstract": "Matching binary to source code and vice versa has various applications in different fields, such as computer security, software engineering, and reverse engineering. Even though there exist methods that try to match source code with binary code to accelerate the reverse engineering process, most of them are designed to focus on one programming language. However, in real life, programs are developed using different programming languages depending on their requirements. Thus, cross-language binary-to-source code matching has recently gained more attention. Nonetheless, the existing approaches still struggle to have precise predictions due to the inherent difficulties when the problem of matching binary code and source code needs to be addressed across programming languages. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-language binary source code matching. We propose GraphBinMatch, an approach based on a graph neural network that learns the similarity between binary and source codes. We evaluate GraphBinMatch on several tasks, such as cross-language binary-to-source code matching and cross-language source-to-source matching. We also evaluate the performance of our approach on single-language binary-to-source code matching. Experimental results show that GraphBinMatch significantly outperforms state-of-the-art, with improvements as high as 15% over the F1 score.",

Decompilation is crucial to transforming an application from machine code to something that can be read and understood by humans. For many programming languages, full decompilation is impossible. These languages build code directly to machine code, and some information, such as variable names, is lost in the process. JIT compilation also makes reverse engineering these applications much easier. Unlike true machine code programs, JIT&#x2010;compiled programs can often be converted to source code. All high&#x2010;level languages are eventually converted into a series of bits called machine code. Assembly code is designed to be a human&#x2010;readable version of machine code. A microarchitecture describes how a particular ISA is implemented on a processor. Reduced instruction set computing architectures define a small number of simpler instructions.</p>",

    "abstract": "Summary <p>This chapter describes at a high level some advanced techniques and tools on the cutting edge of reverse engineering. Timeless debugging is also known as reverse debugging. Binary instrumentation is when security professionals inject code to watch or modify a process as it executes. This can be useful for finding memory leaks, tracing key checks, performing anti&#x2010;anti&#x2010;debugging, etc. Normally, for reversing and cracking, it's necessary to learn and write tools for each new architecture. The idea of intermediate representations is to translate all assembly code for all architectures to the same language. The idea of decompiling is to recover original source code from advanced automated analysis of assembly code. Automatic structure recovery involves automatically finding patterns and links in memory to make inferences about the data types used. Visualization can be used to deepen the understanding of file structure and execution. Theorem provers use mathematics to analyze code, including reduction, deobfuscation, boundaries, inputs, etc.</p>",

    "abstract": "With the vigorous development of technologies such as the Internet, mobile devices, and the Internet of Things, cloud services have gained a crucial position in our life and have become an essential part of daily operations for modern enterprises and organizations. However, existing cloud application security solutions have failed to address the problem of runtime binary code security, focusing only on vulnerabilities inherent to the applications themselves. Code virtualization, also known as virtualization obfuscation, is a technique that protects software from malicious analysis by obfuscating the code. It hides the code’s control flow and data flow, thereby preventing the code from being decompiled. In this paper, we introduce a code virtualization method, VMENP, which splits the code into multiple modules and uses polymorphic and modular encryption mechanisms to secure binary code at runtime. Specifically, VMENP divides the protected program into several modules, designs a virtual instruction set along with its corresponding interpreter, encrypts each instruction individually after converting it into intermediate representations, and then encrypts it again at the basic block level. After compiling the segmented code into polymorphic bytecode sequences, it embeds the virtual code’s interpreter into the IR. During runtime, the protected code is dynamically decrypted and executed by the basic block level, with each basic block’s storage and execution in memory in a short time window. VMENP identifies functions annotated in the source code to locate the functions that need protection. This paper uses a large amount of $\\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{C}++$ code to perform tests in a real cloud environment. Experimental results show that VMENP achieves a good balance between the granularity of protection and the performance overhead of the protected programs, while successfully protecting $\\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{C}++$ code and programs running on X86/64 and ARM32/64 architectures.",

    "abstract": "Vulnerabilities are challenging to locate and repair, especially when source code is unavailable and binary patching is required. Manual methods are time-consuming, require significant expertise, and do not scale to the rate at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. Automated methods are an attractive alternative, and we propose Partially Recompilable Decompilation (PRD) to help automate the process. PRD lifts suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level techniques. Although decompilation and recompilation do not typically succeed on an entire binary, our approach does because it is limited to a few functions, such as those identified by our binary fault localization. We evaluate the assumptions underlying our approach and find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, up to 79% of individual functions are successfully decompiled and recompiled. In comparison, only 1.7% of the full C-binaries succeed. When recompilation succeeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 93.0% of the time. We evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; and human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating only on binaries, perform as well as, and sometimes better than full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a success rate consistent with the same tools operating with access to the entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those produced by top CGC teams. For generality, the evaluation includes two independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world binaries.",

    "abstract": "Software diversification is an effective software protection method against reverse engineering and code reuse attacks, which can provide heterogeneous redundant execution bodies for mimetic defense mechanisms. Most existing software diversification methods require access to the source code, which can provide defenders with more valuable information for devising effective defense strategies. However, due to commercial copyright and the purpose of preventing software piracy, developers often keep their software closed-source, making it difficult to access the source code. Therefore, a method called R2BF (ReCooking and Randomizing Binary File) is proposed, which combines decompilation and diversification compilation techniques to address the difficulty of obtaining the source code. This method involves diversifying the source code through compilation to achieve software diversification for binary executable files. Security and performance testing of diversified C programs has shown that diversified binary executable files can mitigate vulnerabilities resulting from code reuse, validating that this method can enhance the security of binary programs and is feasible for software protection. The diversified binary executable files are nearly identical to the original, non-diversified files in terms of file size and execution time, and may even exhibit acceleration and optimization effects in certain scenarios.",

Vulnerabilities in the device’s software may be discovered after the toolchain for building software for that device has been deprecated, the source-code for the program that is running on the device is unavailable, or both. Current solutions for patching these latent vulnerabilities are insufficient, either requiring deep technical expertise and manual effort or producing a large set of changes to the target binary. The large number of changes in the target program makes validating the patch difficult.We present IRENE, a decompiler that produces recompilable decompilation for patching. IRENE decompiles sub-function regions of a binary program to separate recompilable regions of code. The IRENE compiler replaces the original binary region with recompiled assembly, representing the user’s patch. IRENE allows developers to compose patches by modifying a high-level representation of the target program, but produces targeted micropatches. We evaluate the size of IRENE produced micropatches against patches produced both by recompilation and manual assembly patching in a case study. This evaluation shows a patch size reduction of 4x compared with recompilation and a 21x size reduction when compared with recompiling the patch with a newer toolchain version.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in information technology bring new challenges in cyber security, especially on the Android platform which is the main target of malware attacks. The National Cyber and Crypto Agency (BSSN) as the national cybersecurity institute recorded millions of attacks involving the Android Package Kit (.apk) application for electronic wedding invitations in Indonesia. This research aims to develop a hybrid machine learning model to detect and anticipate malware on Android devices, using algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). The main challenges are the limited number of representative datasets and the lack of effective detection techniquesThis research utilizes a primary server with a virtual machine (VM) to analyze the security of Android applications using mobSF and Frida, involving decompilation, TLS testing, and sensitive feature extraction. The system also depends on an Android emulator and Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for simulation, along with PostgreSQL, Job Scheduler, and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for data management and task scheduling. The dataset comprises 1314 malware samples and 770 benign samples, totaling 2048 Android applications, with an average analysis time of 35 minutes per application. Through data collection and pre-processing, as well as model training and evaluation, it is hoped that the proposed framework can improve the accuracy of malware detection, making a significant contribution in protecting Android users from ever-evolving cyber threats. After performing a comparison using the algorithms mentioned above, it was found that the Random Forest algorithm showed the best performance with an accuracy of 97.11%, a precision of 97.22%, and a recall of 97.11%.",

    "abstract": "Decompilation, which aims to lift a binary to a high-level language such as C, is one of the most common approaches software security analysts use for analyzing binary code. Recovering decompiled code with high readability is essential, as humans must understand the code's functionality correctly. However, some compilation optimization strategies will introduce obfuscation into the binary code, thereby reducing the readability of decompiled code. Among them, the function inlining related optimization strategies combine functions, causing the original function's code volume and complexity to multiply. Especially with self-recursive inlining optimization, it transforms initially simple functions into ones with significantly increased code volume and complex logic, greatly hindering the understanding of security engineers. In this paper, we present Erase, the first approach to reverse the self-recursive inlining optimization technique. We compare Erase with state-of-the-art decompilers Ghidra and Hex-Rays to evaluate ERASE's improvement for the functions affected by self-recursive inlining. Experimental results show that Erase's output is 78.4% and 88.9% more compact (fewer lines of code) than Ghidra and Hex-Rays, respectively. Moreover, reverse engineers spend 88.5% less time analyzing ERASE's output than analyzing Ghidra and 90.4% less time than analyzing Hex-Rays, and the accuracy of analyzing Erase's output is 2.75 times higher than both Ghidra and Hex-Rays.",

    "abstract": "Malware for IoT devices has become popular in recent years. Many detection methods have been proposed to detect the malware, mainly using machine learning, but they are not designed to work on IoT devices and are often implemented using Python. Running a Python program requires the installation of a package, which is impractical given the memory and storage size of IoT devices. In addition, methods that require decompilation, static and dynamic analysis of test samples are difficult to run on IoT devices. Therefore, in this research, we propose a method implemented in C/C++ so that malware detection using byte n-grams and machine learning can be run on IoT devices, and then resource consumption can be measured. Byte n-gram methods are good approaches to detect malware without knowing the execution environment. Moreover, the Top-L approach to information gain can be effectively applied to reduce storage and memory consumption. As a result of the evaluation, when using an SVM model with Top-50000 that maintains effective classification accuracy, the memory consumption was 71.91MB and the storage consumption was 1.3GB, which can be implemented in IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of Internet technology, the threat of malware to computer systems and network security has intensified. Malware affects individual privacy and security and poses risks to critical infrastructures of enterprises and nations. The increasing quantity and complexity of malware, along with its concealment and diversity, challenge traditional detection techniques. Static detection methods struggle against variants and packed malware, while dynamic methods face high costs and risks that limit their application. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel and efficient malware detection techniques to improve accuracy and robustness.This study first employs the minhash algorithm to convert binary files of malware into grayscale images, followed by the extraction of global and local texture features using GIST and LBP algorithms. Additionally, the study utilizes IDA Pro to decompile and extract opcode sequences, applying N-gram and tf-idf algorithms for feature vectorization. The fusion of these features enables the model to comprehensively capture the behavioral characteristics of malware.In terms of model construction, a CNN-BiLSTM fusion model is designed to simultaneously process image features and opcode sequences, enhancing classification performance. Experimental validation on multiple public datasets demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional detection techniques in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, particularly in detecting variants and obfuscated malware with greater stability.The research presented in this paper offers new insights into the development of malware detection technologies, validating the effectiveness of feature and model fusion, and holds promising application prospects.",

    "abstract": "The exponential growth of Android applications has resulted in a surge of malware threats, posing severe risks to user privacy and data security. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel malware detection approach utilizing an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for enhanced classification accuracy. The methodology incorporates a multi-phase process, starting with the extraction and preprocessing of APK (Android app) files. The preprocessing phase involves decompressing, decompiling, and transforming the APK files into bytecode and Dex files. The extracted byte data is converted into 1D vectors and reshaped into 2D grayscale images, enabling efficient feature learning through CNNs. The proposed ensemble of CNN-based models undergoes comprehensive training, validation, and evaluation, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches. We used two popular Android datasets to evaluate the performance of our proposed model. Specifically, the model achieves an accuracy of 98.65%, F1-score of 96.43% on the Drebin dataset and attains 97.91% accuracy, 96.73% of F1-score on the AMD dataset. These results confirm the mode’s ability to effectively identify Android malware with high precision and reliability, outperforming traditional techniques. This research not only underscores the potential of our proposed approach in malware detection but also sets a foundation for future advancements. Future efforts will focus on real-time malware detection, integration with mobile security frameworks, and evaluation across diverse datasets to ensure adaptability to emerging malware threats.",

In order to identify counterfeit APP more quickly and effectively, this paper proposes a counterfeit APP recognition model based on twin network. The model first decompiles and extracts the name, package name, icon, and signature information of the APP, then filters out suspected counterfeit applications by calculating the editing distance of the name, and finally calculates the icon similarity based on the twin network model to determine whether the application is counterfeit. In this paper, datasets containing multiple types of phishing applications are used for experiments, and the effects of VGG16, ResNet50, and ViT algorithms on the recognition results are compared as the basic feature extraction networks. The results show that the accuracy of the ViT-based twin network architecture reaches 85.12%, which can effectively identify counterfeit applications.",

An analysis of existing decompilers is conducted, with examples of programming language constructs that lead to decompilation errors or incorrect decompilation results. The principle of the methodology is demonstrated, and experiments are conducted to confirm that after embedding the digital watermark using the developed approach, it remains resilient to decompilation attacks aimed at its removal. The compiled class file containing the modified bytecode is analyzed.

    "abstract": "Binary-level pointer analysis can be of use in symbolic execution, testing, verification, and decompilation of software binaries. In various such contexts, it is crucial that the result is trustworthy, i.e., it can be formally established that the pointer designations are overapproximative. This paper presents an approach to formally proven correct binary-level pointer analysis. A salient property of our approach is that it first generically considers what proof obligations a generic abstract domain for pointer analysis must satisfy. This allows easy instantiation of different domains, varying in precision, while preserving the correctness of the analysis. In the trade-off between scalability and precision, such customization allows “meaningful” precision (sufficiently precise to ensure basic sanity properties, such as that relevant parts of the stack frame are not overwritten during function execution) while also allowing coarse analysis when pointer computations have become too obfuscated during compilation for sound and accurate bounds analysis. We experiment with three different abstract domains with high, medium, and low precision. Evaluation shows that our approach is able to derive designations for memory writes soundly in COTS binaries, in a context-sensitive interprocedural fashion.",

    "abstract": "The cybersecurity threats targeting industrial control systems (ICSs) are evolving with increasing sophistication. Addressing the detection blind spots in existing source code analysis techniques, this study reveals a dual security paradox arising from code sensitivity: privacy leakage risks caused by decompilation techniques and integrity verification deficiencies in reverse engineering. This article investigates three critical challenges: 1) what are the component flow process and detection elements of ICS component source code? 2) how can high-performance and reliable tracing and traceability be provided for ICS component source code exceptions and routine detection? and 3) how can privacy enhancement and trusted detection of ICS component source code with high sensitivity be achieved? This article proposes a blockchain-integrated trusted detection framework for ICS (BCTD-ICS), delivering groundbreaking solutions: 1) establishing a lifecycle circulation model that systematically maps component types, stakeholders, and detection parameters; 2) developing a tripartite collaborative architecture [blockchain- identification resolution zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)], featuring a traceability mechanism with trusted identification codes (resolution efficiency: 40 ms/105 queries) to eliminate decompilation-induced privacy risks; and 3) creating an industrial-oriented privacy enhancement system utilizing DBSCAN clustering for intelligent sampling (26% compression rate on BCN3D Moveo) and optimizing ZK-SNARK protocols through Shamir’s secret sharing, establishing a backdoor-resistant distributed parameter generation system (time delay increment < 100 ms). Experimentally verified, our solution enables ICS component code detection supply-chain-wise without sensitive data leakage in real-world industries. This work establishes a novel trusted detection paradigm for ICS, advancing detection efficiency and credibility under strict privacy preservation requirements, meeting Industry 4.0 security demands.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of mobile apps has raised generalized concerns regarding security threats, like malware and leakage of data. Most malicious applications masquerade as normal apps to steal private information from users. Conventional security approaches, both static analysis and dynamic analysis, have natural limitations when utilized individually. For the purpose of enhancing mobile security, this work suggests a Comprehensive Mobile Application Security Analysis Framework which combines static analysis, dynamic analysis, malware analysis, and reverse engineering techniques in the interest of identifying security defects in Android applications.The framework employs MoBSF for static analysis, Frida for dynamic instrumentation, VirusTotal for malware detection, and Apktool and Quark for reverse engineering. Apktool enables low-level decompilation of smali code, while Quark focuses on malware behavior detection through API call analysis. All these tools facilitate a comprehensive analysis of APK vulnerabilities, runtime threats, and malicious payloads.In this research paper, we explore various methodologies to analyze and improve mobile application security accuracy through static analysis, dynamic analysis, malware detection, and reverse engineering.This study shows how an integrated approach combining all four techniques improves detection accuracy, reducing false positives and uncovering hidden security threats. Results show that the hybrid approach effectively detects both known and unknown malware, making it an efficient approach for mobile application security assessments.

This paper proposes a static malware analysis framework for identifying malicious code, using Ghidra. The proposed malware analysis framework decompiles malware samples automatically in order to extract features, while reviewing control flow, scanning opcodes, or extracting embedded strings. Additionally, the system uses integrated tools such as VirusTotal API and PEview to validate or classify signatures and analyze file structure. An experimental evaluation of the proposed framework showed an 89% success rate of malware detection that outperformed the performance of traditional signature based methods (72%) and had a lower false-positive rate (7%) than heuristic based methods (15%) under specific conditions. Results suggest that the proposed framework is effective towards the identification of obfuscated malware while being reliable. Unlike earlier traditional techniques, the system user-friendly utilizes Ghidra's improved, advanced capabilities of decompilation and scripts to offer more precision and automation. The solution provides improvement in cybersecurity with an effective, scalable, and automated, static approach to malware analysis.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of deep learning-based binary code similarity detection methods, there has been a proliferation of methods using graph neural networks to learn semantic information from intermediate representations such as control flow graphs. Graph Attention Network (GAT) is a graph neural network model based on the attention mechanism, the core idea of which is to dynamically aggregate information from adjacent nodes by adaptively learning the importance weights between nodes in the graph, which can enhance the training effect of the model by incorporating the attention mechanism. The structured representation advantage of Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) is reflected in the hierarchical decomposition of program syntax structures, which effectively captures the logical semantics and contextual dependencies of the code, a feature that makes AST robust against the obfuscation of cross-architecture binary code. However, there has not yet been an approach that fuses graph attention networks and abstract syntax trees in the field of binary code similarity detection, so we propose a cross-architecture binary code similarity detection approach that fuses abstract syntax trees and graph attention networks. We use the open-source dataset provided by Asteria, decompile the binary code using the binary analysis tool IDA pro to extract the abstract syntax tree as the feature source of the neural network, and deeply optimize GAT for the limitations of processing tree data structure to improve its ability to learn the semantic information of AST. We trained TreeLSTM, plain GAT, and deeply optimized GAT neural network models respectively, and compared them. The experimental results show that the training speed of our proposed method is improved by 54.63% compared to the TreeLSTM-based method, and the AUC and Accuracy metrics are basically comparable.",

    "abstract": "Decompilers play a crucial role in the detailed analysis of malware or firmware, particularly because control-flow structuring allows the recovery of high-level code that is more readable to human analysts. Despite the ongoing debate over their usage of gotos to work around constraints during control-flow structuring, pattern-matching approaches remain prevalent among both commercial and open-source decompilers. With the emergence of pattern-independent restructuring techniques, various attempts have been made to overcome readability limitations, especially concerning the use of gotos. However, despite these advances, recent approaches often fail to thoroughly address several inherent challenges of control-flow structuring, thereby affecting output quality or practicality.In this paper, we systematize the intrinsic challenges of control-flow structuring that every approach must address. In addition, we review existing methods, comparing them, while highlighting both their advantages and limitations with respect to these challenges. Specifically, we emphasize the practicability issues of current pattern-independent restructuring techniques and discuss whether and how future methods might overcome them. Finally, we explore the theoretical potential to mitigate some of these challenges by suggesting methodology ideas for various aspects of control-flow structuring. Overall, this paper enables other researchers to make informed decisions when developing or enhancing control-flow structuring methods, thereby preventing negative side-effects arising from the interdependence of challenges.",

The framework constructs a structured dataset from these features and applies various machine learning classifiers to distinguish ransomware from benign applications. Experiments conducted on two publicly available datasets, including AMD and CI-CAndMal2017, demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness. The Random Forest classifier achieved a peak accuracy of 98.89%, with the ensemble and model also performing competitively.

    "abstract": "Recovering high-level control-flow structures is a crucial part of modern reverse engineering, especially in fields like binary analysis. Here, analysts often use decompilers to convert functions of binary programs into a more humanreadable C -like representation. Among these control-flow structures, switch statements have unique significance because of their ability to represent complex decision-making and branching behavior in a concise and readable manner. Consequently, the successful recovery of switch statements during decompilation can greatly enhance the readability of the resulting output, making it a highly desired goal in the field of reverse engineering. In this paper, we present a new technique for identifying abstract syntax tree components that can be transformed into semantically equivalent switches, thus improving code readability. In contrast to other approaches, we do not rely on jump tables that have or have not been emitted during compilation. Instead, we identify clusters of comparisons involving the same expression but with varying constant values within the abstract syntax tree to be transformed into switch constructs. Because this approach is inherently linked to the semantic definition of a switch statements, it only generates meaningful switches by design. We evaluated our approach on the coreutils-9.3 dataset and compared it to the leading decompilers Ghidra and Hex-Rays, both of which attempt to recover switch statements as well. Our evaluation results indicate that our approach outperforms both Ghidra and Hex-Rays by successfully recovering more than twice as many switch constructs in the given dataset.",

    "abstract": "Mobile devices have become ubiquitous, with iOS being the second most popular mobile operating system on the market [1]. One method iOS uses to ensure the security of its apps is through sandboxing. This mechanism is implemented as a set of rules compiled into binary files that lie inside the OS firmware and which are not made public by Apple. Thus, security engineers require third-party tools to decompile and then visualize the contents of the profiles mentioned above. This paper presents a validation framework for iOS sandbox profile decompilers, specifically targeting the SandBlaster tool. Our approach represents sandbox profiles as dependency graphs and compares decompiled profiles with reference implementations compiled from Sandbox Profile Language (SBPL) representations using SandScout. We evaluated our framework in iOS versions 7–10, analyzing both individual profiles and bundled profile collections. The results demonstrate 100% precision and recall for iOS 7–8 profiles, 90-100% for iOS 9, and 75-100% for iOS 10. We also optimised a performance bottleneck in SandBlaster's node matching algorithm, reducing decompilation time from over 7 hours to under 5 minutes.",

    "abstract": "Cryptographic techniques are widely used to safeguard software against privacy breaches. Efficiently detecting encryption algorithms in software to determine whether they meet security requirements is a critical task. However, traditional static and dynamic detection methods often suffer from high false alarm rates or low efficiency, as they cannot fully capture the structural and semantic features of cryptographic algorithms. In this article, we propose FirmCCF, a vulnerability detection tool for custom cryptographic functions in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. FirmCCF leverages an improved deep learning encoder–decoder classification model, CodeT5-cate, to identify and classify cryptographic functions in source code and decompiled firmware. It then outputs highly structured meta-level attributes of cryptographic functions via a large language model (LLM) and detects vulnerabilities through a query-driven approach. FirmCCF achieves 99.97% accuracy, 99.72% recall, and 99.86%  $F1$ -score in detecting cryptographic functions from binary files. We further define seven security rules, encode them as queries, and use them to uncover seven categories of vulnerabilities. An evaluation of 40902 function codes revealed 46 vulnerabilities, including eight previously unknown issues. Our work highlights the urgent need for systematic assessment solutions to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in custom cryptographic functions.",

    "abstract": "Android malware propagation poses increasing security risks to mobile ecosystems, with conventional detection techniques fighting an uphill battle against advanced evasion strategies and polymorphic variants that take advantage of static analysis limitations. Existing approaches including signature-based detection and conventional machine learning techniques have moderate performance against advanced obfuscation techniques and cannot capture complex structural relationships inherent in malicious code execution behavior. These limitations necessitate advanced techniques capable of carrying out in-depth structural analysis and dynamic pattern detection for malware detection. This paper proposes a new hybrid deep learning technique that combines Control Flow Graph (CFG) analysis with Deep Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (DeepGraphCNNs) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) to overcome current limitations. Our technique meticulously reverse-engineers APK packages, decompiles Dalvik bytecode to extract CFG representations and utilizes sophisticated graph embedding methods (DeepWalk, Node2Vec, Word2Vec) in the feature transformation process. The experiment is conducted on 2,349 samples from CICMalAnal2017 and MalwareBazar. Our DeepWalk-DeepGraphCNNs and TCN model demonstrated superior performance with 95.10% accuracy and 93.67% AUC-ROC. Our experimental results ensure the success of the technique for addressing contemporary Android security issues.",

    "abstract": "The Android operating system continues to face escalating security challenges, primarily due to its open-source nature and the rapid proliferation of applications from untrusted sources. Traditional static analysis tools lack the flexibility to capture evolving malware behaviors, limiting their interpretability and scalability. Large Language Models (LLMs) are now applied in cybersecurity for malware detection, phishing classification, and cyber threat intelligence. However, their use has not been extended to producing detailed and interpretable Android malware analysis reports. This study integrates LLMs into Android malware analysis by creating a dataset for instruction tuning and fine-tuning the Qwen-7B model using the LoRA method. The model MalQwen is developed by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5-7B with 429 malware samples containing decompiled code and expert labeled security reports. MalQwen outperforms models like Gemini and LLaMA, achieving a BERTscore of 0.84 for SMS malware and a Perplexity score of 3.30 for Scareware. These findings confirm MalQwen’s superior performance in generating precise malware reports, validating LLMs as a powerful new method for Android malware analysis.",

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Android applications has made mobile platforms a prime target for malware attacks. To address the growing concern of malicious apps, this study presents an AI-based malware classification approach using Vision Transformer (ViT) on bytecode images of Android applications. Traditional malware detection techniques, including signature-based and heuristic methods, often fail to detect novel and obfuscated malware due to limited generalization and static rule-based systems. These limitations have necessitated the need for more intelligent and adaptive solutions that can handle complex and evolving malware patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework: Real-Time Malware Detection in App Stores using Bytecode Image Generation and Vision Transformer-Based Classification (RAMViD). In this approach, Android APK files are first decompiled to extract Dalvik bytecode, which is then transformed into grayscale images representing the byte patterns of the application. These images are fed into a finetuned Vision Transformer model that learns intricate visual features of benign and malicious patterns for accurate classification. The proposed method can be integrated into app store infrastructures to perform real-time malware analysis during the app submission process. This ensures proactive filtering of malicious applications before they reach end-users, enhancing platform security without manual intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that the ViT-based classification framework outperforms conventional CNN-based models in accuracy and robustness. The system achieves high detection rates with reduced false positives, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying both known and previously unseen malware. This solution offers a scalable, automated, and intelligent alternative for securing Android ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Android app security is a critical concern for the software industry, with companies investing significantly in protecting their intellectual property from reverse engineering attacks. While commercial protection tools exist to prevent decompilation and unauthorized code access, they pose substantial challenges for businesses: high licensing costs ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars annually, significant performance overhead that impacts user experience and app ratings, and increased app size that affects download rates. These limitations particularly burden small to medium-sized enterprises and independent developers, creating an urgent industry need for cost-effective protection solutions.To address these challenges, we propose a novel file format-based anti-decompilation strategy that systematically exploits structural vulnerabilities in APK files. Building upon this strategy, we have developed APKARMOR, a lightweight and cost-effective anti-decompilation framework that exploits inherent vulnerabilities in popular reverse engineering tools. Through systematic analysis, we first identified critical weaknesses in common decompilation tools’ parsing mechanisms and structural assumptions. Based on these findings, we developed seven mutation-based protection strategies that deliberately trigger these vulnerabilities by introducing specific structural anomalies into APK files and the AndroidManifest.xml. These methods include Countermeasures against Dirty Code and Corrupted Payloads (CACoP), Pseudo-Encryption (PE), Using Unknown Compression Method (UUCM), Unavailable Magic Value (UMA), Modify the Offset Field in stringChunk (MOFS), and Dirty Bytecode Replacement of \"Android\" (DRA). We evaluated our exploitation strategies through extensive experiments on 100 randomly selected Android apps, testing against the latest versions of three widely used decompilation tools: JADX (v1.5.1), APKTool (v2.11.0), and Androguard (v4.1.2). Our results demonstrate that PE and DRA achieved complete protection by successfully exploiting vulnerabilities present in all tested tools. MOFS, UUCM, and UNV effectively exploited weaknesses in APKTool and Androguard’s parsing mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, PHP has consistently been one of the most popular server-side programming languages among developers for web development. To protect intellectual property, various PHP source code obfuscation and encryption methods have been developed, which has led to difficulties in performing security analysis on PHP source code. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of recovering source code by extracting bytecode from PHP during dynamic execution. However, there is still a lack of a universal decompilation method for this kind of bytecode, tailored to PHP’s unique syntax. Thus, we propose a systematic decompilation framework for PHP bytecode. First, we design a unified intermediate representation that eliminates the differences between bytecodes from different PHP versions. Then, we introduce a structural analysis algorithm specifically for PHP syntax, improving upon existing methods to better accommodate PHP’s unique syntax. We use over 3 million lines of PHP code as a dataset and compiled it into PHP bytecode. After decompiling it with our method, we successfully recovered 92% of the classes and 85% of the methods. Furthermore, from the encrypted dataset containing 37 SQL injection and 31 XSS vulnerability patterns, we fully restored the original vulnerability patterns and reconstructed the exploitation chains. Furthermore, we identified a series of vulnerabilities in real-world projects and were assigned 6 new CVE IDs1, demonstrating the correctness of our method and its ability to assist in static analysis for vulnerability discovery.1CVE-2025-45046, CVE-2025-45047, CVE-2025-45048, CVE-2025-45049, CVE-2025-45050, CVE-2025-45052",

Compilation/decompilation canonicalise syntactic changes made to source code and can be used as source code normalisation. We used NiCad to detect clones before and after decompilation in three open source software systems, JUnit, JFreeChart, and Tomcat. We filtered and compared the clones in the original and decompiled clone set and found that 1,201 clone pairs (78.7%) are common between the two sets while 326 pairs (21.3%) are only in one of the sets. A manual investigation identified 325 out of the 326 pairs as true clones. The 252 original-only clone pairs contain a single false positive while the 74 decompiled-only clone pairs are all true positives. Many clones in the original source code that are detected only after decompilation are type-3 clones that are dicult to detect due to added or deleted statements, keywords, package names; flipped if-else statements; or changed loops. We suggest to use decompilation as normalisation to compliment clone detection. By combining clones found before and after decompilation, one can achieve higher recall without losing precision.",

Due to unknown build flags and compiler information, third party components usually cannot be reused. When it comes to the matter of software components developed in C language, the only place to look for this information is in compiled binary file. Since there are no standards for C language that bind compiler to leave any information about itself in binary file, the information is not expected to be found. However, the information can be found in most of the binary files. This paper investigates what is the possibility of retrieving the information about compiler name and version based on the content of the binary code, without decompiling the binary code. The information retrieving opens up new possibilities for reusing the components and verifying the software requirements as well.",

One application's popularity can be measured by its downloading times, and it is valuable for commercial advertising. Identifying app installation packages from network traffic is one of the most feasible approaches to collect these data. But asymmetric routing, incomplete capture and so on make it challenging to determine app's name at large scale in network traffic. With these constraints, we proposed AppTwins, an efficient, robust and automatical approach which has the ability to determine corrupted package's name. The identification consists of three distinct steps. Step 1, identify app packages with a stream fuzzy hash fingerprint database in live network traffic. Step 2, the unprecedented ones were captured and decompiled to acquire new app's name, a fingerprint was also calculated. Step3, update the database with new app's name and fingerprint. AppTwins achieves up a recall rate of 97.63% and a precision rate of 96.44% when app packages are almost complete. Furthermore, It can also identify incomplete app packages in the real traffic where there are no name or URL.",

    "abstract": "Android access control granularity based on its permission mechanism is relatively coarse, which cannot effectively protect the user privacy. Many Android applications do not strictly abide by the principle of least privilege (PLP). Both benign and malicious apps may request more permissions than those they really use. We rethink previous permission over-claim problem of Android applications, and extend it to three kinds of problems: Explicit Permission Over-claim, Implicit Permission Over-claim and Ad Library Permission Over-claim. The latter two problems are new that have not been raised by any previous work. Static analysis is to decompile the applications to generate intermediate code and then analyze the usage of permissions. Our static analysis on 10710 applications shows that 76.08% of them may have Explicit Permission Over-claim problem, among those there are 424 applications that have sensitive permissions, which are only used in the advertisement library's code of the applications rather than developer's own code. They have Ad Library Permission Over-claim problem. The main idea of our semantic analysis is to calculate the semantic similarity between apps' descriptions and function phrases. If the similarity exceeds a certain threshold, the app is considered relevant to the corresponding function. We compare the results of the semantic analysis with those of manual reading of 102 Android application descriptions. The F-measures of the three chosen functions are 80.82%, 70.48% and 89.62%, respectively. The evaluation results show our method can efficiently detect the above three kinds of permission over claim problems which indicates that our method would be helpful for normal users to have a clear understanding of permission usage of Android applications.",

    "abstract": "With Android application packing technology evolving, there are more and more ways to harden APPs. Manually unpacking APPs becomes more difficult as the time needed for analyzing increase exponentially. At the beginning, the packing technology is designed to prevent APPs from being easily decompiled, tampered and re-packed. But unfortunately, many malicious APPs start to use packing service to protect themselves. At present, most of the antivirus software focus on APPs that are unpacked, which means if malicious APPs apply the packing service, they can easily escape from a lot of antivirus software. Therefore, we should not only emphasize the importance of packing, but also concentrate on the unpacking technology. Only by doing this can we protect the normal APPs, and not miss any harmful APPs at the same time. In this paper, we first systematically study a lot of DEX packing and unpacking technologies, then propose and develop a universal unpacking system, named CrackDex, which is capable of extracting the original DEX file from the packed APP. We propose three core technologies: simulation execution, DEX reassembling, and DEX restoration, to get the unpacked DEX file. CrackDex is a part of the Dalvik virtual machine, and it monitors the execution of functions to locate the unpacking point in the portable interpreter, then launches the simulation execution, collects the data of original DEX file through corresponding structure pointer, finally fulfills the unpacking process by reassembling the data collected. The results of our experiments show that CrackDex can be used to effectively unpack APPs that are packed by packing service in a universal approach without any other knowledge of packing service.",

This method is applied collectively to the whole section, not a specific section of the app, so it is difficult to control the section (flow) desired by the user or the manager. In addition, system overhead can occur because the control is applied to the whole section of the app. In this paper, we propose a method to insert an additional security policy code at a certain interval position in the intermediate code of a binary app, so that it can be controlled at a specific interval rather than the whole interval of the app. The proposed method extracts and saves the security policy intermediate code and the related file in advance and then adds the security policy code to the specific method on the intermediate code of the specific activity acquired by decompiling the target app. Finally, the additional security policy code is modified to avoid errors caused by the additional code. We create an automation tool for performance verification, experiment with five commercial office apps, and confirm that the apps work properly with the added EMM security functions.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, medicine has seen how technology was going day by day more present to become necessary. At the same time, security became a critical aspect, since private patient medical data are handled. In this field in which gather mobile technologies with medicine, security has great importance. Therefore, it is essential to conduct security audits to mobile applications which deal with private information and confidential patient data. The main objective of this paper is to carry out an audit of security of an mHealth Android application. Taking HeartKeeper application to self-manage cardiac patients, a series of tests and modifications are conducted to check its strengths and weaknesses. The methodology consists in attempting to decompile the application HeartKeeper. Applying to the source code techniques of reverse engineering, we will try to perform an analysis that allows us to carry out the security check of the Android application HeartKeeper. It can be applied to audit security on any other Android application. In this way, it provides developers a tool that allows them to check the security of any Android app. Among these vulnerabilities found, the most relevant is that which allows us to inject code to steal some private information. This information should only be accessible from the application itself and only once the user is authenticated. As solutions, we propose different protections. These are: protection against decompilation, against code analysis, and against modified applications. It is very important to carry out a comprehensive review of the mobile applications' strength, since they are increasingly present in our lives and they manage sensitive and protected data. It is highly recommended to install applications from trusty sources, as they are the official app stores like Google Play Store in Android and iOS App Store.",

Apple follows a mandatory code signing process to ensure that applications are developed by trusted enterprises/developers and no malware exists on App Store. However, past attacks on iOS devices such as ikee, Wirelurker have revealed that Apple's code signing process is not sufficient to ensure the security of its devices.

    "abstract": "Reverse engineering is the process of decompiling and disassembling the executables to recover the source code/assembly code embedded within it. While reverse engineering is the process of examining the code, in offensive context the attackers can re-engineer the code which leads to software piracy. Software anti-tamper technology like obfuscation is used to deter both reverse engineering and re-engineering of proprietary software and software-powered systems. Code obfuscation, as a part of software protection, got commercial interest from both vendors and as well as from the clients. Vendors want to keep their proprietary code as secret and customers needs software upon which they can trust. In this article, a code obfuscation technique has been proposed to complicate the process of reverse engineering. The basic idea is to conceal the proprietary code section by using preventive design obfuscation and insertion of self-modifying code at the binary level. The combination of design level obfuscation and the insertion of self-modifying code converts the code into a semantically equivalent one that makes it difficult to reverse engineer. The technique is evaluated using different sorting algorithms. The experimental results quantify the degree of obfuscation, stealth of the code, and effects on execution time and code size.",

Our solution, SmartInspect, also uses a mirror-based architecture to represent locally object responsible for the interpretation of the contract state.

    "abstract": "Configuring and maintaining a firewall configuration is notoriously hard. Policies are written in low-level, platform-specific languages where firewall rules are inspected and enforced along non trivial control flow paths. Further difficulties arise from Network Address Translation (NAT), since filters must be implemented with addresses translations in mind. In this work, we study the problem of decompiling a real firewall configuration into an abstract specification. This abstract version throws the low-level details away by exposing the meaning of the configuration, i.e., the allowed connections with possible address translations. The generated specification makes it easier for system administrators to check if: (i) the intended security policy is actually implemented; (ii) two configurations are equivalent; (iii) updates have the desired effect on the firewall behavior. The peculiarity of our approach is that is independent of the specific target firewall system and language. This independence is obtained through a generic intermediate language that provides the typical features of real configuration languages and that separates the specification of the rulesets, determining the destiny of packets, from the specification of the platform-dependent steps needed to elaborate packets. We present a tool that decompiles real firewall configurations from different systems into this intermediate language and uses the Z3 solver to synthesize the abstract specification that succinctly represents the firewall behavior and the NAT. Tests on real configurations show that the tool is effective: it synthesizes complex policies in a matter of minutes and, and it answers to specific queries in just a few seconds. The tool can also point out policy differences before and after configuration updates in a simple, tabular form.",

More critically, the k-max pooling method with better results was adopted in the pooling operation phase, and which improves the detection effect of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the detection system achieved the accuracy of 99%, which is 2%-11 % higher than the accuracy of the machine learning detection algorithms when using the same dataset.

Malimg dataset, a publicly available benchmark data set was used for the experimentation. The architecture used in this work is a hybrid cost-sensitive network of one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which obtained an accuracy of 94.4%, an increase in performance compared to work done by [1] which got 84.9%. Hyper parameter tuning is done on deep learning architecture to set the parameters. A learning rate of 0.01 was taken for all experiments. Train-test split of 70-30% was done during experimentation. This facilitates to find how well the models perform on imbalanced data sets.

    "abstract": "The rise of smart contracts - autonomous applications running on blockchains - has led to a growing number of threats, necessitating sophisticated program analysis. However, smart contracts, which transact valuable tokens and cryptocurrencies, are compiled to very low-level bytecode. This bytecode is the ultimate semantics and means of enforcement of the contract. We present the Gigahorse toolchain. At its core is a reverse compiler (i.e., a decompiler) that decompiles smart contracts from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into a highlevel 3-address code representation. The new intermediate representation of smart contracts makes implicit data- and control-flow dependencies of the EVM bytecode explicit. Decompilation obviates the need for a contract's source and allows the analysis of both new and deployed contracts. Gigahorse advances the state of the art on several fronts. It gives the highest analysis precision and completeness among decompilers for Ethereum smart contracts - e.g., Gigahorse can decompile over 99.98% of deployed contracts, compared to 88% for the recently-published Vandal decompiler and under 50% for the state-of-the-practice Porosity decompiler. Importantly, Gigahorse offers a full-featured toolchain for further analyses (and a “batteries included” approach, with multiple clients already implemented), together with the highest performance and scalability. Key to these improvements is Gigahorse's use of a declarative, logic-based specification, which allows high-level insights to inform low-level decompilation.",

    "abstract": "During compilation from Java source code to bytecode, some information is irreversibly lost. In other words, compilation and decompilation of Java code is not symmetric. Consequently, the decompilation process, which aims at producing source code from bytecode, must establish some strategies to reconstruct the information that has been lost. Modern Java decompilers tend to use distinct strategies to achieve proper decompilation. In this work, we hypothesize that the diverse ways in which bytecode can be decompiled has a direct impact on the quality of the source code produced by decompilers. We study the effectiveness of eight Java decompilers with respect to three quality indicators: syntactic correctness, syntactic distortion and semantic equivalence modulo inputs. This study relies on a benchmark set of 14 real-world open-source software projects to be decompiled (2041 classes in total). Our results show that no single modern decompiler is able to correctly handle the variety of bytecode structures coming from real-world programs. Even the highest ranking decompiler in this study produces syntactically correct output for 84% of classes of our dataset and semantically equivalent code output for 78% of classes.",

    "abstract": "We classify .NET files as either benign or malicious by examining directed graphs derived from the set of functions comprising the given file. Each graph is viewed probabilistically as a Markov chain where each node represents a code block of the corresponding function, and by computing the PageRank vector (Perron vector with transport), a probability measure can be defined over the nodes of the given graph. Each graph is vectorized by computing Lebesgue antiderivatives of hand-engineered functions defined on the vertex set of the given graph against the PageRank measure. Files are subsequently vectorized by aggregating the set of vectors corresponding to the set of graphs resulting from decompiling the given file. The result is a fast, intuitive, and easy-to-compute glass-box vectorization scheme, which can be leveraged for training a standalone classifier or to augment an existing feature space. We refer to this vectorization technique as PageRank Measure Integration Vectorization (PMIV). We demonstrate the efficacy of PMIV by training a vanilla random forest on 2.5 million samples of decompiled. NET, evenly split between benign and malicious, from our in-house corpus and compare this model to a baseline model which leverages a text-only feature space. The median time needed for decompilation and scoring was 24ms. 11Code available at https://github.com/gtownrocks/grafuple",

As an open system, the security issues of Android application emerge in endlessly, such as the reverse decompilation of installation package, malicious code injection, application piracy, interface hijacking, SMS hijacking and input monitoring. These security issues will also appear on mobile applications in the power industry, which will not only result in the embezzlement of applied knowledge copyrights but also lead to serious leakage of users' information and even economic losses. It may even result in the remote malicious control of key facilities, which will cause serious social issues. Under the background of the development of smart grid information construction, also with the application and promotion of power services in mobile terminals, information security protection for mobile terminal applications and interactions with the internal system of the power grid has also become an important research direction.

And this paper demonstrates an experiment to verify the precision and performance. For the test data, we selected five Android applications: three of which are well known malware, two of which are malware made by us.

However, less than 1% of deployed smart contracts are open-source, and it is difficult for users to understand the functionality and internal mechanism of those closed-source contracts. Although a few decompilers for smart contracts have been recently proposed, it is still not easy for users to grasp the semantic information of the contract, not to mention the potential misleading due to decompilation errors. In this paper, we propose the first system named Stan to generate descriptions for the bytecodes of smart contracts to help users comprehend them. In particular, for each interface in a smart contract, Stan can generate four categories of descriptions, including functionality description, usage description, behavior description, and payment description, by leveraging symbolic execution and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. Extensive experiments show that Stan can generate adequate, accurate and readable descriptions for contract’s bytecodes, which have practical value for users.",

This step consists of instruction translation (i.e. recovery of operation semantics), control flow extraction and address identification.The main contribution of this paper is the second step, which builds on data flow analysis and refinement of indirect (i.e. data-dependent) control flow. This step makes the processed bitcode much more amenable to formal analysis.To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we have compiled a set of benchmark programs into native executables and analysed them using two LLVM-based tools: DIVINE, a software model checker and KLEE, a symbolic execution engine.

This research proposed a methodology to protect the application assets from piracy using the cryptographic algorithm. The assets are encrypted during the compile-time using the Gradle build system provided by the Android Studio. While the decryption is performed in the Android device during the application run-time. The proposed algorithm is the pair of asymmetric algorithm called RSA and the symmetric algorithm called AES.

    "abstract": "Decompilers are indispensable tools in Android malware analysis and app security auditing. Numerous academic works also employ an Android decompiler as the first step in a program analysis pipeline. In such settings, decompilation is frequently regarded as a \"solved\" problem, in that it is simply expected that source code can be accurately recovered from an app. While a large proportion of methods in an app can typically be decompiled successfully, it is common that at least some methods fail to decompile. In order to better understand the practical applicability of techniques in which decompilation is used as part of an automated analysis, it is important to know the actual expected failure rate of Android decompilation. To this end, we have performed what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale study of Android decompilation failure rates. We have used three sets of apps, consisting of, respectively, 3,018 open-source apps, 13,601 apps from a recent crawl of Google Play, and a collection of 24,553 malware samples. In addition to the state-of-the-art Dalvik bytecode decompiler jadx, we used three popular Java decompilers. While jadx achieves an impressively low failure rate of only 0.02% failed methods per app on average, we found that it manages to recover source code for all methods in only 21% of the Google Play apps.We have also sought to better understand the degree to which in-the-wild obfuscation techniques can prevent decompilation. Our empirical evaluation, complemented with an indepth manual analysis of a number of apps, indicate that code obfuscation is quite rarely encountered, even in malicious apps. Moreover, decompilation failures mostly appear to be caused by technical limitations in decompilers, rather than by deliberate attempts to thwart source-code recovery by obfuscation. This is an encouraging finding, as it indicates that near-perfect Android decompilation is, at least in theory, achievable, with implementation-level improvements to decompilation tools.",

    "abstract": "As more and more IOT Applications implemented in electric power industry, source code leaking gradually becomes an important topic for discussion. Some researches have proved that IOT APP could be cracked down and source code (C/C++, JAVA, etc) is likely to be decompiled by attackers with expert skills. And this trend is going to be irreversible with a variety of auto-cracking tools published, which means that the cost of time and cracking technique are unprecedentedly decreased. To avoid source code leaking, some ways of protecting native code in ELF file such as code obfuscation or ELF shell (special in Android) were provided and then applied widely. But these schemes can not meanwhile completely satisfy the performance and secure rate in Linux platform. This paper originally proposes a scheme that protects native code from being decompiled and stolen in situation where ELF file is called by JAVA in Linux. The SM4 encryption algorithm and look-up table are creatively used to achieve the goals of apparently elevating the security within a limited performance price. At the posterior of the paper, a control experiment between one famous open source project and this scheme is introduced to supply the data supporting.",

    "abstract": "Industrial control systems (ICSs) consist of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) which communicate with an engineering station on one side, and control a certain physical process on the other side. Siemens PLCs, particularly S7-300 controllers, are widely used in industrial systems, and modern critical infrastructures heavily rely on them. But unfortunately, security features are largely absent in such devices or ignored/disabled because security is often at odds with operations. As a consequence of the already reported vulnerabilities, it is possible to leverage PLCs and perhaps even the corporate IT network. In this paper we show that S7-300 PLCs are vulnerable and demonstrate that exploiting the execution process of the logic program running in a PLC is feasible. We discuss a replay attack that compromises the password protected PLCs, then we show how to retrieve the Bytecode from the target and decompile the Bytecode to STL source code. Afterwards we present how to conduct a typical injection attack showing that even a very tiny modification in the code is sufficient to harm the target system. Finally we combine the replay attack with the injection approach to achieve a stronger attack – the stealth program injection attack – which can hide the previous modification by engaging a fake PLC, impersonating the real infected device. For real scenarios, we implemented all our attacks on a real industrial setting using S7-300 PLC. We eventually suggest mitigation approaches to secure systems against such threats.",

    "abstract": "On-device deep learning models have shown growing popularity in mobile apps, which allows offline model inference while preserving user privacy. However, on-device deep learning models also introduce security challenges, i.e., the trained models can be easily stolen or even be tampered by attackers. Recent studies suggested that most of the on-device models are lacking of sufficient protection, i.e., can be stolen by decompiling the apps directly. In this work, we present MMGUARD, an automated framework for building mutual authentication between Android apps and deep neural network models, which can thus protect on-device models from being easily attacked (piracy and tampering). Unlike existing model protect methods, our approach does not require model re-training or any prior knowledge of the training data. The key idea of MMGUARD is to verify the deep learning model in the app before inference, i.e., feeding owner- and apprelated information to it, which can greatly increase the effort of model hacking. We evaluate MMGUARD on 5 popular image classification DNNs and 43 real world Android apps from Google Play. Experiment results suggest that MMGUARD introduces negligible latency on models and can be automatically applied to real world apps.",

    "abstract": "Recovering variables and data structure information from stripped binary is a prominent challenge in binary program analysis. While various state-of-the-art techniques are effective in specific settings, such effectiveness may not generalize. This is mainly because the problem is inherently uncertain due to the information loss in compilation. Most existing techniques are deterministic and lack a systematic way of handling such uncertainty. We propose a novel probabilistic technique for variable and structure recovery. Random variables are introduced to denote the likelihood of an abstract memory location having various types and structural properties such as being a field of some data structure. These random variables are connected through probabilistic constraints derived through program analysis. Solving these constraints produces the posterior probabilities of the random variables, which essentially denote the recovery results. Our experiments show that our technique substantially outperforms a number of state-of-the-art systems, including IDA, Ghidra, Angr, and Howard. Our case studies demonstrate the recovered information improves binary code hardening and binary decompilation.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we discuss an approach which allows an attacker to modify the control logic program that runs in S7 PLCs in its high-level decompiled format. Our full attack-chain compromises the security measures of PLCs, retrieves the machine bytecode of the target device, and employs a decompiler to convert the stolen compiled bytecode (low-level) to its decompiled version (high-level) e.g. Ladder Diagram LAD. As the LAD code exposes the structure and semantics of the control logic, our attack also manipulates the LAD code based on the attacker’s understanding to the physical process causing abnormal behaviors of the system that we target. Finally, it converts the infected LAD code to its executable version i.e. machine bytecode that can run on the PLC using a compiler before pushing the malicious code back to the PLC. For a real scenario, we implemented our full attack-chain on a small industrial setting using real S7-300 PLCs, and built the database (for our decompiler and compiler) using 108 different control logic programs of varying complexity, ranging from simple programs consisting of a few instructions to more complex ones including multi functions, sub-functions and data blocks. We tested and evaluated the accuracy of our decompiler and compiler on 5 random programs written for real industrial applications. Our experimental results showed that an external adversary is able to infect S7 PLCs successfully. We eventually suggest some potential mitigation approaches to secure systems against such a threat.",

Considering that WhatsApp is very popular and has many users, the results of this investigation are very useful for users to avoid malicious applications. In this study, we have conducted an exploration of the source code of the WhatsApp and WhatsApp Plus applications to find out whether or not WhatsApp Plus has been inserted with malware, spyware, or other malicious code. The exploration used the static analysis method, where the source code of the two applications were decompiled, compared, and analyzed. The de-compilation is done using the MobSF tool and the comparison using the extension of Visual Studio Code called Compare Folders. The differences in the source code found are then analyzed for possible behavior to determine whether it can cause harm, for example stealing user credentials. Although no malicious code was found on WhatsApp Plus, in our study, users must stay alert since they remain vigilant in installing and using WhatsApp Plus because the developer may add malicious code to the next version update.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of binary code is a building block of computer security. Especially in malware or firmware analysis where source code oftentimes is not available, techniques like decompilation are utilized to Figure out the functionality of binaries. During the optimization phase in modern compilers, human-readable expressions are often transformed into instruction sequences (compiler idioms or idioms) that may be more efficient in terms of speed or size than the direct translation. However, these transformations are often considerably worse in terms of readability for the analyst. Such compiler specific sequences are not only significantly longer than the apparent translation of the original high-level language operation but also have no trivial correlation to the original expression’s semantics. Modern decompilers address this issue by reverting idioms using static, manually crafted rules. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to find and annotate arithmetic idioms with their corresponding high-level language expressions to significantly simplify manual analysis. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require manual work to create the patterns for matching idioms and significantly less manual labour to derive the transformation rules to calculate the original constants. In our evaluation, we compared the results of PIdARCI against the current academic and commercial state-of-the-art Ghidra, RetDec, and Hex Rays / IDA Pro. We show that PIdARCI matches more than 99% of all considered idioms, exceeding the matching rate of the other approaches.",

This paper proposes a method to measure the similarity of smart contract bytecode. Firstly, the key opcode combination of smart contract is summarized. When traversing the CFG(control flow graph) constructed by decompilation of smart contract bytecode, the opcodes in the basic block are pattern matched, and the features between the basic blocks are extracted according to the in-out degree, so as to enhance the similarity measurement effect of contract semantics in vector space.

First, the binary sample of the malicious code of the APT attack are preprocessed with some operations such as decompression and decompilation. APT attack malicious code samples are running in a sandbox with anti-code escaping technology, and the acquired data are converted into grayscale images. Then, we perform feature extraction and family clustering operations on the pre-processed image. Finally, the DenseNet convolutional neural network model is trained and tested on the sample data of the APT attack malicious code of eight families. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed scheme for the detection of APT attack malicious code and its variants can reach 98.84%.

    "abstract": "Binary lifters convert executables into an intermediate representation (IR) of a compiler framework. The recovered IR code is generally deemed “analysis friendly,” bridging low-level code analysis with well-established compiler infrastructures. With years of development, binary lifters are becoming increasingly popular for use in various security, systems, and software (re)-engineering applications. Recent studies have also reported highly promising results that suggest binary lifters can generate LLVM IR code with correct functionality, even for complex cases.This paper conducts an in-depth study of binary lifters from an orthogonal and highly demanding perspective. We demystify the “expressiveness” of binary lifters, and reveal how well the lifted LLVM IR code can support critical downstream applications in security analysis scenarios. To do so, we generate two pieces of LLVM IR code by compiling C/C++ programs or by lifting the corresponding executables. We then feed these two pieces of LLVM IR code to three keystone downstream applications (pointer analysis, discriminability analysis, and decompilation) and determine whether inconsistent analysis results are generated. We study four popular static and dynamic LLVM IR lifters that were developed by the industry or academia from a total of 252,063 executables generated by various compilers and optimizations and on different architectures. Our findings show that modern binary lifters afford IR code that is highly suitable for discriminability analysis and decompilation, and suggest that such binary lifters can be applied in common similarity- or code comprehension-based security analysis (e.g., binary diffing). However, the lifted IR code appears unsuited to rigorous static analysis (e.g., pointer analysis). To obtain a more comprehensive view of the utility of binary lifters, we also compare the performance of lifter-enabled approaches with that of binary-only tools in three security tasks, i.e., sanitization, binary diffing, and C decompilation. We summarize our findings and make suggestions for the correct use and further enhancement of binary lifters. We also explored practical ways to enhance the accuracy of pointer analysis using lifted IR code, by using and augmenting Debin, a tool for predicting debug information.",

It runs a control-logic program that specifies monitoring and controlling a physical process and is a common target of cyberattacks. A vendor-provided proprietary engineering software is typically used to investigate the infected control logic. This paper shows that an attacker can use control-logic obfuscation as an anti-forensics technique to hinder the investigations and incident response. The control-logic obfuscation subverts the engineering software’s decompilation function; therefore, we call it a denial-of-decompilation attack.

    "abstract": "With society’s increasing reliance on computer systems and network technology, the threat of malicious software grows more and more serious. In the field of information security, malware detection has been a key problem that academia and industry are committed to solving. Machine learning is an effective method for processing large-scale data, such as the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and deep neural network technology. Although these types of detection methods can deal with cyber threats, most feature extraction methods are based on the statistical information features of portable executable (PE) files and thus lack the decompiled code and execution flow structure of the PE samples. Therefore, we propose a Control-Flow Graph (CFG)- and Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)-based malware classification system. The feature vectors of CFG basic blocks are generated using the large-scale pre-trained language model MiniLM, which is beneficial for the GIN to further learn and compress the CFG-based representation, and classified with multi-layer perceptron. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of the representation under different dimensions and classifiers. To evaluate our method, we set up a CFG-based malware detection graph dataset from a PE file of the Blue Hexagon Open Dataset for Malware Analysis (BODMAS), which we call the Malware Geometric Binary Dataset (MGD-BINARY) and collected the experimental results of CFG representation in different dimensions and classifier settings. The evaluation results show that our proposal has proved an Accuracy metric of 0.99160 and achieved 0.99148 Area Under the Curve (AUC) results.",

    "abstract": "The software compilation process has a tendency to obscure the original design of the system and makes it difficult both to identify individual components and discern their purpose simply by examining the resulting binary code. Although decompilation techniques attempt to recover higher-level source code from the machine code in question, they are not fully able to restore the semantics of the original functions. Furthermore, binaries are often stripped of metadata, and this makes it challenging to reverse engineer complex binary software. In this paper we show how a combination of binary decomposition techniques, decompilation passes, and LLM-powered function summarization can be used to build an economical engine to identify modules in stripped binaries and associate them with high-level natural language descriptions. We instantiated this technique with three underlying open-source LLMs -- CodeQwen, DeepSeek-Coder and CodeStral -- and measured its effectiveness in identifying modules in robotics firmware. This experimental evaluation involved 467 modules from four devices from the ArduPilot software suite, and showed that CodeStral, the best-performing backend LLM, achieves an average F1-score of 0.68 with an online running time of just a handful of seconds.

    "abstract": "Cryptographic libraries are a main target of timing side-channel attacks. A practical means to protect against these attacks is to adhere to the constant-time (CT) policy. However, it is hard to write constant-time code, and even constant-time code can be turned vulnerable by mainstream compilers. So how can we verify that binary code is constant-time? The obvious answer is to use binary-level CT tools. To do so, a common approach is to use decompilers or lifters as a front-end for CT analysis tools operating on source code or IR. Unfortunately, this approach is problematic with current decompilers. To illustrate this fact, we use the recent Clangover vulnerability and other constructed examples to show that five popular decompilers eliminate CT violations, rendering them not applicable with the approach. In this paper, we develop foundations to asses whether a decompiler is fit for the Decompile-then-Analyze approach. We propose CT transparency, which states that a transformation neither eliminates nor introduces CT violations, and a general method for proving that a program transformation is CT transparent. Then, we build CT-RetDec, a CT analysis tool based on a modified version of the LLVM-based decompiler RetDec. We evaluate CT-RetDec on a benchmark of real-world vulnerabilities in binaries, and show that the modifications had significant impact on CT-RetDec's performance. As a contribution of independent interest, we found that popular tools for binary-level CT analysis rely on decompiler-like transformations before analysis. We show that two such tools employ transformations that are not CT transparent, and, consequently, that they incorrectly accept non-CT programs. While our examples are very specific and do not invalidate the general approach of these tools, we advocate that tool developers counter such potential issues by proving the transparency of such transformations.

    "abstract": "Binary-source code matching plays an important role in many security and software engineering related tasks such as malware detection, reverse engineering and vulnerability assessment. Currently, several approaches have been proposed for binary-source code matching by jointly learning the embeddings of binary code and source code in a common vector space. Despite much effort, existing approaches target on matching the binary code and source code written in a single programming language. However, in practice, software applications are often written in different programming languages to cater for different requirements and computing platforms. Matching binary and source code across programming languages introduces additional challenges when maintaining multi-language and multi-platform applications. To this end, this paper formulates the problem of cross-language binary-source code matching, and develops a new dataset for this new problem. We present a novel approach XLIR, which is a Transformer-based neural network by learning the intermediate representations for both binary and source code. To validate the effectiveness of XLIR, comprehensive experiments are conducted on two tasks of cross-language binary-source code matching, and cross-language source-source code matching, on top of our curated dataset. Experimental results and analysis show that our proposed XLIR with intermediate representations significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art models in both of the two tasks.",

Previous research efforts mainly focus on transforming binary code to assembly code strings using reverse compilation and then using pre-trained deep learning models with large parameters to obtain feature representation vector of binary code. While these models have proven to be effective in representing binary code, their large parameter size leads to considerable computational expenses during both training and inference. In this paper, we present a lightweight neural network, called FastBCSD, that employs a dynamic instruction vector encoding method and takes only assembly code as input feature to achieve comparable accuracy to the pre-training models while reducing the computational resources and time cost. On the BinaryCorp dataset, our method achieves a similar average MRR score to the state-of-the-art pre-training-based method (jTrans), while on the BinaryCorp 3M dataset, our method even outperforms the latest technology by 0.01. Notably, FastBCSD has a much smaller parameter size (13.4M) compared to jTrans (87.88M), and its latency time is 1/5 of jTrans on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti.",

However, only a small number of Ethereum contracts have released their source code, so vulnerability detection at the bytecode level is crucial. This paper introduces SmartBugBert, a novel approach that combines BERT-based deep learning with control flow graph (CFG) analysis to detect vulnerabilities directly from bytecode. Our method first decompiles smart contract bytecode into optimized opcode sequences, extracts semantic features using TF-IDF, constructs control flow graphs to capture execution logic, and isolates vulnerable CFG fragments for targeted analysis. By integrating both semantic and structural information through a fine-tuned BERT model and LightGBM classifier, our approach effectively identifies four critical vulnerability types: transaction-ordering, access control, self-destruct, and timestamp dependency vulnerabilities. Experimental evaluation on 6,157 Ethereum smart contracts demonstrates that SmartBugBert achieves 90.62% precision, 91.76% recall, and 91.19% F1-score, significantly outperforming existing detection methods. Ablation studies confirm that the combination of semantic features with CFG information substantially enhances detection performance. Furthermore, our approach maintains efficient detection speed (0.14 seconds per contract), making it practical for large-scale vulnerability assessment. ",

    "abstract": "There exists a dichotomy between classical probabilistic graphical models, such as Bayesian networks (BNs), and modern tractable models, such as sum-product networks (SPNs). The former generally have intractable inference, but provide a high level of interpretability, while the latter admits a wide range of tractable inference routines, but are typically harder to interpret. Due to this dichotomy, tools to convert between BNs and SPNs are desirable. While one direction -- compiling BNs into SPNs -- is well discussed in Darwiche's seminal work on arithmetic circuit compilation, the converse direction -- decompiling SPNs into BNs -- has received surprisingly little attention. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing SPN2BN, an algorithm that decompiles an SPN into a BN. SPN2BN has several salient features when compared to the only other two works decompiling SPNs. Most significantly, the BNs returned by SPN2BN are minimal independence-maps that are more parsimonious with respect to the introduction of latent variables. Secondly, the output BN produced by SPN2BN can be precisely characterized with respect to a compiled BN. More specifically, a certain set of directed edges will be added to the input BN, giving what we will call the moral-closure. Lastly, it is established that our compilation-decompilation process is idempotent. This has practical significance as it limits the size of the decompiled SPN. ",

    "abstract": "The ability to identify authors of computer programs based on their coding style is a direct threat to the privacy and anonymity of programmers. While recent work found that source code can be attributed to authors with high accuracy, attribution of executable binaries appears to be much more difficult. Many distinguishing features present in source code, e.g. variable names, are removed in the compilation process, and compiler optimization may alter the structure of a program, further obscuring features that are known to be useful in determining authorship. We examine programmer de-anonymization from the standpoint of machine learning, using a novel set of features that include ones obtained by decompiling the executable binary to source code. We adapt a powerful set of techniques from the domain of source code authorship attribution along with stylistic representations embedded in assembly, resulting in successful de-anonymization of a large set of programmers. We evaluate our approach on data from the Google Code Jam, obtaining attribution accuracy of up to 96% with 100 and 83% with 600 candidate programmers. We present an executable binary authorship attribution approach, for the first time, that is robust to basic obfuscations, a range of compiler optimization settings, and binaries that have been stripped of their symbol tables. We perform programmer de-anonymization using both obfuscated binaries, and real-world code found \"in the wild\" in single-author GitHub repositories and the recently leaked Nulled.IO hacker forum. We show that programmers who would like to remain anonymous need to take extreme countermeasures to protect their privacy. ",

Although multicore architectures are ubiquitous, the state-of-the-art translation tools do not handle concurrency primitives correctly. Doing so is rather challenging because of the subtle differences in the concurrency models between architectures. In response, we address various aspects of the challenge. First, we develop correct and efficient translations between the concurrency models of two mainstream architecture families: x86 and ARM (versions 7 and 8). We develop direct mappings between x86 and ARMv8 and ARMv7, and fence elimination algorithms to eliminate redundant fences after direct mapping. Although our mapping utilizes ARMv8 as an intermediate model for mapping between x86 and ARMv7, we argue that it should not be used as an intermediate model in a decompiler because it disallows common compiler transformations. Second, we propose and implement a technique for inserting memory fences for safely migrating programs between different architectures. Our technique checks robustness against x86 and ARM, and inserts fences upon robustness violations. Our experiments demonstrate that in most of the programs both our techniques introduce significantly fewer fences compared to naive schemes for porting applications across these architectures. ",

Commercial malware detection software can be costly, and tools that attribute malware to the specific software vulnerabilities it exploits are largely lacking. Understanding the connection between malware and the vulnerabilities it targets is crucial for analyzing past threats and proactively defending against current ones. In this study, we propose an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect binary malware, specifically within JAR files, and uses LLM capabilities combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that malware may exploit. We developed a proof-of-concept tool, MalCVE, that integrates binary code decompilation, deobfuscation, LLM-based code summarization, semantic similarity search, and LLM-based CVE classification. We evaluated MalCVE using a benchmark dataset of 3,839 JAR executables. MalCVE achieved a mean malware-detection accuracy of 97%, at a fraction of the cost of commercial solutions. In particular, the results demonstrate that LLM-based code summarization enables highly accurate and explainable malware identification. MalCVE is also the first tool to associate CVEs with binary malware, achieving a recall@10 of 65%, which is comparable to studies that perform similar analyses on source code. ",

Although various approaches for automatic analysis exist and are the subject of ongoing research, analysts often have to resort to manual static analysis to get a deep understanding of a given binary sample. Since the source code of encountered samples is rarely available, analysts regularly employ decompilers for easier and faster comprehension than analyzing a binary's disassembly. In this paper, we introduce our decompilation approach dewolf. We developed a variety of improvements over the previous academic state-of-the-art decompiler and some novel algorithms to enhance readability and comprehension, focusing on manual analysis. To evaluate our approach and to obtain a better insight into the analysts' needs, we conducted three user surveys. The results indicate that dewolf is suitable for malware comprehension and that its output quality noticeably exceeds Ghidra and Hex-Rays in certain aspects. Furthermore, our results imply that decompilers aiming at manual analysis should be highly configurable to respect individual user preferences. Additionally, future decompilers should not necessarily follow the unwritten rule to stick to the code-structure dictated by the assembly in order to produce readable output. In fact, the few cases where dewolf already cracks this rule lead to its results considerably exceeding other decompilers. We publish a prototype implementation of dewolf and all survey results on GitHub. ",

While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference. We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

We demonstrate the feasibility of identifying vulnerable programs through a combined approach of decompilation optimization to make the vulnerabilities more prominent and long-term memory for a larger context window, achieving state-of-the-art performance in binary vulnerability analysis.

The experimental results show that our feature improves accuracy and F1-score by 3.3% and 0.07, respectively, on a CNN based malware detector with realistic benign and malicious samples. ",

    "abstract": "Control flow obfuscation (CFO) alters the control flow path of a program without altering its semantics. Existing literature has proposed several techniques; however, a quick survey reveals a lack of clarity in the types of techniques proposed, and how many are unique. What is also unclear is whether there is a disparity in the theory and practice of CFO. In this paper, we systematically study CFO techniques proposed for Java programs, both from papers and commercially available tools. We evaluate 13 obfuscators using a dataset of 16 programs with varying software characteristics, and different obfuscator parameters. Each program is carefully reverse engineered to study the effect of obfuscation. Our study reveals that there are 36 unique techniques proposed in the literature and 7 from tools. Three of the most popular commercial obfuscators implement only 13 of the 36 techniques in the literature. Thus there appears to be a gap between the theory and practice of CFO. We propose a novel classification of the obfuscation techniques based on the underlying component of a program that is transformed. We identify the techniques that are potent against reverse engineering attacks, both from the perspective of a human analyst and an automated program decompiler. Our analysis reveals that majority of the tools do not implement these techniques, thus defeating the protection obfuscation offers. We furnish examples of select techniques and discuss our findings. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to assemble such a research. This study will be useful to software designers to decide upon the best techniques to use based upon their needs, for researchers to understand the state-of-the-art and for commercial obfuscator developers to develop new techniques.

    "abstract": "Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security, as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \\textbf\\{19,448\\} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \\textbf\\{19\\} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation. ",

    "abstract": "Security experts reverse engineer (decompile) binary code to identify critical security vulnerabilities. The limited access to source code in vital systems - such as firmware, drivers, and proprietary software used in Critical Infrastructures (CI) - makes this analysis even more crucial on the binary level. Even with available source code, a semantic gap persists after compilation between the source and the binary code executed by the processor. This gap may hinder the detection of vulnerabilities in source code. That being said, current research on Large Language Models (LLMs) overlooks the significance of decompiled binaries in this area by focusing solely on source code. In this work, we are the first to empirically uncover the substantial semantic limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs when it comes to analyzing vulnerabilities in decompiled binaries, largely due to the absence of relevant datasets. To bridge the gap, we introduce DeBinVul, a novel decompiled binary code vulnerability dataset. Our dataset is multi-architecture and multi-optimization, focusing on C/C++ due to their wide usage in CI and association with numerous vulnerabilities. Specifically, we curate 150,872 samples of vulnerable and non-vulnerable decompiled binary code for the task of (i) identifying; (ii) classifying; (iii) describing vulnerabilities; and (iv) recovering function names in the domain of decompiled binaries. Subsequently, we fine-tune state-of-the-art LLMs using DeBinVul and report on a performance increase of 19%, 24%, and 21% in the capabilities of CodeLlama, Llama3, and CodeGen2 respectively, in detecting binary code vulnerabilities. Additionally, using DeBinVul, we report a high performance of 80-90% on the vulnerability classification task. Furthermore, we report improved performance in function name recovery and vulnerability description tasks. ",

Purpose: We aim at developing the first assembly decompiler tool for a modern AMD GPU architecture that generates code in the OpenCL language, which is widely used for programming GPGPUs. Results: We developed the algorithms for the following operations: preprocessing assembly code, searching data accesses, extracting system values, decompiling arithmetic operations and recovering data types. We also developed templates for decompilation of branching operations. Practical relevance: We implemented the presented algorithms in Python as a tool called OpenCLDecompiler, which supports a large subset of AMD GCN instructions. This tool automatically converts disassembled GPGPU code into the equivalent OpenCL code, which reduces the effort required to analyze assembly code. ",

    "abstract": "Automated GUI testing is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of Android apps. However, the efficacy of existing UI testing techniques is often limited, especially in terms of coverage. Recent studies, including the state-of-the-art, struggle to achieve more than 30% activity coverage in real-world apps. This limited coverage can be attributed to a combination of factors such as failing to generate complex user inputs, unsatisfied activation conditions regarding device configurations and external resources, and hard-to-reach code paths that are not easily accessible through the GUI. To overcome these limitations, we propose CovAgent, a novel agentic AI-powered approach to enhance Android app UI testing. Our fuzzer-agnostic framework comprises an AI agent that inspects the app's decompiled Smali code and component transition graph, and reasons about unsatisfied activation conditions within the app code logic that prevent access to the activities that are unreachable by standard and widely adopted GUI fuzzers. Then, another agent generates dynamic instrumentation scripts that satisfy activation conditions required for successful transitions to those activities. We found that augmenting existing fuzzing approaches with our framework achieves a significant improvement in test coverage over the state-of-the-art, LLMDroid, and other baselines such as Fastbot and APE (e.g., 101.1%, 116.3% and 179.7% higher activity coverage, respectively). CovAgent also outperforms all the baselines in other metrics such as class, method, and line coverage. We also conduct investigations into components within CovAgent to reveal further insights regarding the efficacy of Agentic AI in the field of automated app testing such as the agentic activation condition inference accuracy, and agentic activity-launching success rate.

Given that the main purpose of decompilation is to facilitate code comprehension in scenarios where the source code is unavailable, the understandability of decompiled code is of great importance. In this paper, we propose the first empirical study on the understandability of Java decompiled code and obtained the following findings: (1) Understandability of Java decompilation is considered as important as its correctness, and decompilation understandability issues are even more commonly encountered than decompilation failures. (2) A notable percentage of code snippets decompiled by Java decompilers exhibit significantly lower or higher levels of understandability in comparison to their original source code. (3) Unfortunately, Cognitive Complexity demonstrates relatively acceptable precision while low recall in recognizing these code snippets exhibiting diverse understandability during decompilation. (4) Even worse, perplexity demonstrates lower levels of precision and recall in recognizing such code snippets. Inspired by the four findings, we further proposed six code patterns and the first metric for the assessment of decompiled code understandability. This metric was extended from Cognitive Complexity, with six more rules harvested from an exhaustive manual analysis into 1287 pairs of source code snippets and corresponding decompiled code. This metric was also validated using the original and updated dataset, yielding an impressive macro F1-score of 0.88 on the original dataset, and 0.86 on the test set. ",

    "abstract": "Hardware decompilation reverses logic synthesis, converting a gate-level digital electronic design, or netlist, back up to hardware description language (HDL) code. Existing techniques decompile data-oriented features in netlists, like loops and modules, but struggle with sequential logic. In particular, they cannot decompile memory elements, which pose difficulty due to their deconstruction into individual bits and the feedback loops they form in the netlist. Recovering multi-bit registers and memory blocks from netlists would expand the applications of hardware decompilation, notably towards retargeting technologies (e.g. FPGAs to ASICs) and decompiling processor memories. We devise a method for register aggregation, to identify relationships between the data flip-flops in a netlist and group them into registers and memory blocks, resulting in HDL code that instantiates these memory elements. We aggregate flip-flops by identifying common enable pins, and derive the bit-order of the resulting registers using functional dependencies. This scales similarly to memory blocks, where we repeat the algorithm in the second dimension with special attention to the read, write, and address ports of each memory block. We evaluate our technique over a dataset of 13 gate-level netlists, comprising circuits from binary multipliers to CPUs, and we compare the quantity and widths of recovered registers and memory blocks with the original source code. The technique successfully recovers memory elements in all of the tested circuits, even aggregating beyond the source code expectation. In 10 / 13 circuits, all source code memory elements are accounted for, and we are able to compact up to 2048 disjoint bits into a single memory block. ",

    "abstract": "Binary analysis is a core component of many critical security tasks, including reverse engineering, malware analysis, and vulnerability detection. Manual analysis is often time-consuming, but identifying commonly-used or previously-seen functions can reduce the time it takes to understand a new file. However, given the complexity of assembly, and the NP-hard nature of determining function equivalence, this task is extremely difficult. Common approaches often use sophisticated disassembly and decompilation tools, graph analysis, and other expensive pre-processing steps to perform function similarity searches over some corpus. In this work, we identify a number of discrepancies between the current research environment and the underlying application need. To remedy this, we build a new benchmark, REFuSE-Bench, for binary function similarity detection consisting of high-quality datasets and tests that better reflect real-world use cases. In doing so, we address issues like data duplication and accurate labeling, experiment with real malware, and perform the first serious evaluation of ML binary function similarity models on Windows data. Our benchmark reveals that a new, simple basline, one which looks at only the raw bytes of a function, and requires no disassembly or other pre-processing, is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in multiple settings. Our findings challenge conventional assumptions that complex models with highly-engineered features are being used to their full potential, and demonstrate that simpler approaches can provide significant value.

    "abstract": "Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in industrial control systems (ICS) are vulnerable to remote control logic injection attacks. Attackers target the control logic of a PLC to manipulate the behavior of a physical process such as nuclear plants, power grids, and gas pipelines. Control logic attacks have been studied extensively in the literature, including hiding the transfer of a control logic over the network from both packet header-based signatures, and deep packet inspection. For instance, these attacks transfer a control logic code as data, into small fragments (one-byte per packet), that are further padded with noise data. To detect control logic in ICS network traffic, this paper presents Shade , a novel shadow memory technique that observes the network traffic to maintain a local copy of the current state of a PLC memory. To analyze the memory contents, Shade employs a classification algorithm with 42 unique features categorized into five types at different semantic levels of a control logic code, such as number of rungs, number of consecutive decompiled instructions, and n-grams. We then evaluate Shade against control logic injection attacks on two PLCs, Modicon M221 and MicroLogix 1400 from two ICS vendors, Schneider electric and Allen-Bradley, respectively. The evaluation results show that Shade can detect an attack instance (i.e., identifying at least one attack packet during the transfer of a malicious control logic) accurately without any false alarms.",

For machine learning based Android malware detection, feature extraction plays a key role. Thinking the source codes of applications are comparable with text documents, we propose a new Android malware detection method based on the topic model which is an effective technique in text feature extraction. Our method regards the decompiled codes of an application as a text document, and the topic model is used to mine the potential topics in the codes which can reflect the semantic feature of the application. The experimental results demonstrate that, our approach performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. Also, our method mines the features in the application files automatically without manually design, and therefore overcomes the limitation in present methods which relies on experts’ prior knowledge.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents Similo , an automated scalable framework for control logic forensics in industrial control systems. Similo is designed to investigate denial of engineering operations (DEO) attacks, recently demonstrated to hide malicious control logic in a programmable logic controller (PLC) at field sites from an engineering software (at control center). The network traffic (if captured) contains substantial evidence to investigate DEO attacks including manipulation of control logic. Laddis , a state-of-the-art forensic approach for DEO attacks, is a binary-logic decompiler for the Allen-Bradley’s RSLogix engineering software and MicroLogix 1400 PLC. It is developed with extensive manual reverse engineering effort of the underlying proprietary network protocol and the binary control logic. Unfortunately, Laddis is not scalable and requires similar efforts to extend on other engineering software/PLCs. The proposed solution, Similo , is based on the observation that engineering software of different vendors are equipped with decompilers. Similo is a virtual-PLC framework that integrates the decompilers with their respective (previously-captured) ICS network traffic of control logic. It recovers the binary logic into a high-level source code (of the programming languages defined by IEC 61131-3 standard) automatically. Similo can work with both proprietary/open protocols without requiring protocol specifications and the binary formats of control logic. Thus, it is scalable to different ICS vendors. We evaluate Similo on three PLCs of two ICS vendors, i.e. MicroLogix 1400, MicroLogix 1100, and Modicon M221. These PLCs support proprietary protocols and the control logics written in two programming languages: Ladder Logic and Instruction List. The evaluation results show that Similo can accurately reconstruct a control logic from an ICS network traffic and can be used to investigate the DEO attacks effectively.",

    "abstract": "Intent-Based Networking (IBN) is showing significant improvements in network management, especially by reducing the complexity through intent-level languages. However, IBN is not yet integrated and widely deployed in most networks. Network operators may still encounter several issues deploying new intents, such as reasoning about complex configurations to understand previously deployed rules before writing an intent to update the network state. Many networks include several devices distributed along with its topology, each device configured using vendor-specific languages. Thus, inferring the behavior of devices as high-level intents from low-level configurations can be an arduous and time-consuming task. Current solutions that derive high-level representations from bottom-up configuration analysis can not represent configurations in an intent-level. In this work, we present a bottom-up approach to extract intents from network configurations. To validate our approach, we develop a system called SCRIBE (SeCuRity Intent-Based Extractor), which decompiles security configurations from different network devices and translates them to an intent-level language called Nile. To demonstrate the feasibility of SCRIBE, we outline a case study and evaluate with dumps of real-world firewall configurations containing rules from various servers and institutions.",

Formal methods are used during three phases of the decompilation process: control flow recovery, symbolic execution, and variable analysis. The use of formal methods minimizes the trusted code base and ensures soundness: the extracted C code behaves the same as the original binary. Soundness and recompilablity enable C code decompilation to be used in the contexts of binary patching, binary porting, binary analysis and binary improvement, with confidence that the recompiled code’s behavior is consistent with the original program. We demonstrate that FoxDec can be used to improve execution speed by recompiling a binary with different compiler options, to patch a memory leak with a code transformation tool, and to port a binary to a different architecture. FoxDec can also be leveraged to port a binary to run as a unikernel, a minimal and secure virtual machine usually requiring source access for porting.",

The network can achieve its intended functionality through testing by mnist dataset and convolution neural network. Round function is added between the abstract network and concrete network in order to get the representative generation of class.

The input can be changed to any form by encoder and then change it back by decoder through inverse function. The concrete network can be seen as the memory stored by the parameters. Lethe is that when new knowledge input, the training process makes the parameters change. At last, the application of the network is discussed.

Behavior-based Android malware detection is mostly based on permission analysis and API calls. In this paper, we propose a static Android malicious detection scheme based on sensitive API calls. We extracted all APIs called in the experimental samples through decompilation, and then calculated and ranked the threats related to these APIs according to the mutual information model, selected the top 20 sensitive API calls, and generated a 20-dimensional feature vector for each application. In the classification process, an integrated learning model based on DT classifier, kNN classifier and SVM classifier is used to effectively detect unknown APK samples. We collected 516 benign samples and 528 malicious samples. Through a large number of experiments, the results show that the accuracy of our scheme can be up to 94\\%, and the precision is up to 95\\%.",

    "abstract": "Growing numbers of advanced malware-based attacks against governments and corporations, for political, financial and scientific gains, have taken security breaches to the next level. In response to such attacks, both academia and industry have investigated techniques to model and reconstruct these attacks and to defend against them. While such efforts have been all useful in mitigating the effects of modern attacks, automated malware code reuse inspection and campaign attribution have received less attention. In this paper, we present an automated system, called SCRUTINIZER , to identify code reuse in malware via a novel machine learning-based encoding mechanism at the function-level. By creating a large knowledge base of previously observed and tagged malware campaigns, we can compare unknown samples against this knowledge base and determine how much overlap exists. SCRUTINIZER leverages an unsupervised learning approach to filter out irrelevant functions before code reuse detection. It provides two valuable capabilities. First, it identifies ties between an unknown sample and those malware specimens that are known to be used by a specific campaign. Second, it inspects if specific tools or functionalities are used by a campaign. Using SCRUTINIZER , we were able to identify 12 samples that were previously unknown to us and that we were able to correctly assign to well-known APT campaigns.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in applying verification tools to programs that have bitvector operations. SMT solvers, which serve as a foundation for these tools, have thus increased support for bitvector reasoning through bit-blasting and linear arithmetic approximations. In this paper we show that similar linear arithmetic approximation of bitvector operations can be done at the source level through transformations. Specifically, we introduce new paths that over-approximate bitvector operations with linear conditions/constraints, increasing branching but allowing us to better exploit the well-developed integer reasoning and interpolation of verification tools. We show that, for reachability of bitvector programs, increased branching incurs negligible overhead yet, when combined with integer interpolation optimizations, enables more programs to be verified. We further show this exploitation of integer interpolation in the common case also enables competitive termination verification of bitvector programs and leads to the first effective technique for linear temporal logic (LTL) verification of bitvector programs. Finally, we provide an in-depth case study of decompiled (“lifted”) binary programs, which emulate X86 execution through frequent use of bitvector operations. We present a new tool DarkSea , the first tool capable of verifying reachability, termination and LTL of lifted binaries.",

As one of the most popular operating systems, Android is a prime target for security attacks. Only in 2019, 10.5 million malware was detected. Recursive neural networks are in essence machine models made up of a list of cells. Their particularity is that part of the output of the previous cell is used as input for the next one. LSTM have shown good results in several areas, for example, text generation, translation, trajectory prediction. Among the recursive neural network models, LSTM is one of the most efficient approaches to sequence classification as it is able to make relations between very distant elements in a sequence. This research explored the application of LSTM for Android malware detection using source code decompiled from the Android Application Package (APK). The approach we have tried is to first extract the instructions from the source code while respecting their execution order as much as possible. We then explored several ways to filter and encode these instructions. For all feature sets we created, we obtained an accuracy greater than 70 \\\\(\\\\\\%\\\\) of accuracy and for some feature sets the accuracy reached 83 \\\\(\\\\\\%\\\\) showing that it is possible to successfully detect malware using source code and LSTM.",

Second, based on the behavior graph of malware samples, we propose a method to extract the public behavior graph as the features of malware families. Finally, a graph matching network is used to learn and calculate the similarity between the public behavior graph and the software behavior graph, and use it as the basis for detection. Our evaluation of the dataset containing 1274 malware apps and 108 benign apps shows that the selected public behavior graph is effective for Android malware detection, with an overall accuracy of 90.4\\%. The experimental results show that the method has a high detection rate and a low false rate, and can detect malware and its variants.",

To this end, this paper presents XFSim ( Cross -architecture F unction-level binary code Sim ilarity detection), through binary lifting and neural similarity metric learning. Firstly, to make the detection method architecture agnostic, the binaries to be analyzed are lifted to an intermediate code called LLVM-IR and normalized for an uniform representation, so as to alleviate the discrepancies between the raw assemblies of different instruction set architectures (ISAs). Secondly, we utilize FastText, a widely used word embedding algorithm, that learns on the functions’ normalized intermediate codes to obtain high quality token embeddings. Then, an efficient CNN-based model is utilized to encode the semantics of each function into numerical vectors, meanwhile the siamese neural network structure is resorted to supervise the whole model training, with the goal of minimizing the contrastive loss. Finally, the similarity of two binary code snippets can measured by the cosine similarity of their encoded vectors. The experiments conducted on a public dataset show that, the strategy of lifting and normalizing the assemblies to uniform representations greatly alleviates the semantic-gaps between different ISAs, and XFSim outperforms two existing cross-architecture binary code similarity detectors.",

    "abstract": "Despite the large number of approaches proposed for detecting malicious applications targeting platforms such as Android, malware continuously evolves in order to avoid its detection and reach the users. Likewise, malware detection engines are continuously improved, trying to detect the most modern malware. Most of these detection tools employ signatures or machine learning models, trained on thousands of features, such as API calls, permissions or using taint analysis, among many others, and using machine learning classification algorithms such as decision trees, ensemble methods or deep learning. However, the use of these features leads to biased models due to the use of limited datasets, without considering the real semantics (goals and intentions) of the malicious sample. In this paper, we conduct an initial study of the use of context and semantic aware embeddings generated with the CodeT5 pre-trained language model for a better representation of the behaviour of Android applications. After decompiling a sample to Java, it is possible to generate embeddings from chunks of the source code, generating a rich representation of the sample. We show how these embeddings can be used to train a recurrent neural network for malware detection tasks, evidencing promising results.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Decompilation is currently a widely used tool in reverse engineering and exploit detection in binaries. Ghidra, developed by the National Security Agency, is one of the most popular decompilers. It decompiles binaries to high P-Code, from which the final decompilation output in C code is generated. Ghidra allows users to work with P-Code, so users can analyze the intermediate representation directly. Several projects make use of this to build tools that perform verification, decompilation, taint analysis and emulation, to name a few. P-Code lacks a formal semantics, and its documentation is limited. It has a notoriously subtle semantics, which makes it hard to do any sort of analysis on P-Code. We show that P-Code, as-is, cannot be given an executable semantics. In this paper, we augment P-Code and define a complete, executable, formal semantics for it. This is done by looking at the documentation and the decompilation results of binaries with known source code. The development of a formal P-Code semantics uncovered several issues in Ghidra, P-Code, and the documentation. We show that these issues affect projects that rely on Ghidra and P-Code. We evaluate the executability of our semantics by building a P-Code interpreter that directly uses our semantics. Our work uncovered several issues in Ghidra and allows Ghidra users to better leverage P-Code.",

    "abstract": "Reverse engineering is undoing or circumventing the protections deployed on a code region. Software crackers perform this to remove license checks in commercial applications and video games, but it can also be done for legitimate purposes. Many software houses perform a security assessment phase by reverse engineering their protected software before releasing it to the market. Furthermore, anti-virus experts need to reverse engineering malware (e.g., viruses and ransomware) to understand how it works and spreads. Typically, reverse engineering is performed by hand with minimal computer support with debuggers, decompilers, and disassemblers. Nevertheless, in recent years, new research directions have proposed various promising automatic methods, primarily based on machine learning and symbolic execution techniques.",

    "abstract": "Manual translation of the algorithms from sequential version to its parallel counterpart is time consuming and can be done only with the specific knowledge of hardware accelerator architecture, parallel programming or programming environment. The automation of this process makes porting the code much easier and faster. The key aspect in this case is how efficient the generated parallel code will be. The paper describes J-Parallelio, the framework for automatic analysis of the bytecode source codes and its parallelisation on multicore processors. The process consists of a few steps. First step is a process of decompilation of JVM and its translation to internal abstract syntax tree, the dependency extraction and memory analysis is performed. Finally, the mapping process is performed which consists of a set of rules responsible for translating the input virtual machine source code to its parallel version. The main novelty is that it can deal with pure java virtual machine and can generate parallel code for multicore processors. This makes the system portable and it can work with different languages based on JVM after some small modifications. The efficiency of automatically translated source codes were compared with their manually written counterparts on chosen benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Binary and source matching is vital for vulnerability detection or program comprehension. Most existing works focus on library matching (coarse-grained) by utilizing some simple features. However, they are so coarse-grained that high false positives occur since developers tend to reuse source code library partly. These shortcomings drive us to perform fine-grained matching (i.e., binary and source function matching). At the same time, due to the enormous differences between the form of binary and source functions, function matching (fine-grained) meets huge challenges. In this work, inspired by the decompilation technique and advanced neural networks, we propose tool, a D ecompilation based deep B inary- S ource function M atching framework. Specifically, we take the triplet features from both binary pseudo-code and source code functions as input, which are extracted from code property graph and can represent both the syntactic and semantic information. In this way, the binary and source functions are represented in the same feature space so to ease the matching model to learn function similarity. For the matching model, we adopt a self-attention based siamese network with contrastive loss. Experiments on two datasets, R 0 and R 3, show that our tool achieves consistent improvements than other methods, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-attention based matching model, and our triplets features can well capture the two kinds of code functions. Our work improves the accuracy of binary and source code matching, which in turn enables us to better address security issues such as vulnerability detection and program comprehension.",

    "abstract": "Standard control flow graphs (CFGs) extracted from binaries by state-of-the-art disassembly/decompilation tools do not include information about exception-related control flow. However, such information is useful when statically analyzing programs that utilize structured exceptions. To fill that gap, we propose the concept of Exceptional Interprocedural Control Flow Graphs (EICFGs) . These graphs extend traditional CFGs by adding edges for stack unwinding, frame cleanup, and try/catch behavior caused by thrown exceptions. We provide an approach for generating EICFGs from x86-64 binaries featuring C++ exceptions. The approach is based on symbolically executing an abstract semantics that includes binary-level exception-related function calls. We validated our abstract semantics by generating concrete test cases that were then evaluated using real binaries. We applied an implementation of our approach to 341 off-the-shelf x86-64 binaries compiled from C++ as well as C and Fortran source code. From those binaries, we identified 2574 unique throws and successfully resolved the exceptional control flow for every one of them. We show that resolving throws leads to increased instruction reachability and uncovers edges not found by state-of-the-art tools such as Ghidra.",

However, as with other neural network models, there is currently no general method available to explain their inner workings. The present paper represents a first step towards this direction. We utilize Transformer Compiler for RASP (Tracr) to generate a large dataset of pairs of transformer weights and corresponding RASP programs. Based on this dataset, we then build and train a model, with the aim of recovering the RASP code from the compiled model. We demonstrate that the simple form of Tracr compiled transformer weights is interpretable for such a decompiler model. In an empirical evaluation, our model achieves exact reproductions on more than 30\\% of the test objects, while the remaining 70\\% can generally be reproduced with only few errors. Additionally, more than 70\\% of the programs, produced by our model, are functionally equivalent to the ground truth, and therefore a valid decompilation of the Tracr compiled transformer weights.",

    "abstract": "WebAssembly (abbreviated WASM) is a low-level bytecode language designed for client-side execution in web browsers. As WASM continues to gain widespread adoption and its security concerns, the need for decompilation techniques that recover high-level source code from WASM binaries has grown. However, little research has been done to assess the quality of decompiled code from WASM. This paper aims to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis between decompiled C code from WASM binaries and state-of-the-art native binary decompilers. To achieve this goal, we presented a novel framework for empirically evaluating C-based decompilers from various aspects, thus assessing the proficiency of WASM decompilers in generating readable and correct code when compared to native binary decompilers. Specifically, we evaluated the decompiled code’s correctness , readability , and structural similarity with the original code from current WASM decompilers. We validated the proposed metrics’ practicality in decompiler assessment and provided insightful observations regarding the characteristics and constraints of existing decompiled code. By encouraging improvements in these tools, we seek to enhance their use in critical tasks such as auditing and sandboxing third-party libraries. This, in turn, contributes to bolstering the security and reliability of software systems that rely on WASM and native binaries.",

However, compilers do not process the source programs directly; they instead work on control flow graphs (CFGs) of the programs. Unfortunately, there is little formalization of structured CFGs. This paper shows how the lack of formalization has led to varying interpretations of structured CFGs. The paper next presents new formalization of structured CFGs which eliminates the ambiguity. Structured CFGs gain importance as they ease compiler optimizations, decompilation, and help reduce the performance degradation caused by thread divergence on SIMD units. The paper elaborates on these benefits. It also shows that compilers, both front-ends and back-ends, may generate unstructured CFGs from structured program sources, which necessitates mechanisms to obtain structured CFGs from unstructured ones.",

    "abstract": "Energy bugs in Android apps are defects that can make Android systems waste much energy as a whole. Energy bugs detection in Android apps has become an important issue since smartphones usually operate on a limited amount of battery capacity and the existence of energy bugs may lead to serious drain in the battery power. This paper focuses on detecting two types of energy bugs, namely resource leak and layout defect, in Android apps. A resource leak is a particular type of energy wasting phenomena where an app does not release its acquired resources such as a sensor and GPS. A layout defect refers to a poor layout structure causing more energy consumption for measuring and drawing the layout. In this paper, we present a static analysis technique called SAAD, that can automatically detect energy bugs in a context-sensitive way. SAAD detects the energy bugs by taking an inter-procedural anaysis of an app. For resource leak analysis, SAAD decompiles APK file into Dalvik bytecodes files and then performs resource leak analysis by taking components call relationship analysis, inter-procedure and intra-procedure analysis. For detecting layout defect, SAAD firstly employs Lint to perform some traditional app analysis, then filters energy defects from reported issues. Our experimental result on 64 publicly-available Android apps shows that SAAD can detect energy bugs effectively. The accuracies of detecting resource leak and layout energy defect are \\\\(87.5\\\\\\%\\\\) and \\\\(78.1\\\\\\%\\\\) respectively.",

    "abstract": "Unauthorized code modification through reverse engineering is a major concern for Android application developers. Code reverse engineering is often used by adversaries to remove the copyright protection or advertisements from the app, or to inject malicious code into the program. By making the program difficult to analyze, code obfuscation is a potential solution to the problem. However, there is currently little work on applying code obfuscation to compiled Android bytecode. This paper presents DexPro , a novel bytecode level code obfuscation system for Android applications. Unlike prior approaches, our method performs on the Android Dex bytecode and does not require access to high-level program source or modification of the compiler or the VM. Our approach leverages the fact all except floating operands in Dex are stored in a 32-bit register to pack two 32-bit operands into a 64-bit operand. In this way, any attempt to decompile the bytecode will result in incorrect information. Meanwhile, our approach obfuscates the program control flow by inserting opaque predicates before the return instruction of a function call, which makes it harder for the attacker to trace calls to protected functions. Experimental results show that our approach can deter sophisticate reverse engineering and code analysis tools, and the overhead of runtime and memory footprint is comparable to existing code obfuscation methods.",

During memory forensics, kernel data structures are essential information. Existing solutions obtain this information by analyzing debugging information or by decompiling kernel functions to handle a certain range of versions. In this paper, by collecting and analyzing a number of Linux versions, we characterize the properties of different Linux kernel versions and how struct offsets change between versions. Furthermore, the Linux kernel provides over 10,000 configurable features, which leads to different kernel structure layouts for the same kernel version. To deal with this problem, we propose a method of identifying kernel struct layout based on brute-force matching. By examining the relationships between kernel structures, common features are extracted and exploited for brute-force matching.

    "abstract": "Analysts sometimes need to analyze the app depending on the situation. There are two main ways to analyze Android apps. This is the static analysis that grasps the flow of the app through the source code and the dynamic analysis that analyzes the variable that changes during the app’s operation. For dynamic analysis, this can be done by setting the debugging option of the Android Manifest file. In most cases, modification is done by decompiling the app and modifying the original source. In some cases, however, there is a problem with the decompiling process. So we propose a way to modify the debugging option of the Android manifest file to “true” without decompiling the app.",

    "abstract": "Android apps developed in Java language is vulnerable to repackaging attacks as it is easy to decompile an app. Therefore, obfuscation techniques can be used to make it difficult to analyzing the source of Android apps. However, repackaging attacks are fundamentally impossible to block. Especially, it has been confirmed that most Android-based smart phones do not support verification process for the forged applications. Accordingly, the user installs and uses a fake app that appears to be functioning normally. In this case, the user is easily exposed to attacks such as leakage of personal information. Therefore, in this paper, we have constructed mobile apps identification system that applies the signature self-verification server monitoring method for Android apps and proposed a method of judging Android mobile forgery apps by performing the verification process.",

    "abstract": "One of the leading and the most popular operating system for smartphones and tablets is an Android. Being an open-source platform has also become a prime target for the attackers as growing users. This paper focuses on the work done on the Android platform by performing static analysis on the permission-based framework and permission extraction tool—AndRev, which is designed. Extracted many permission-based features by reverse engineering of the Android application (apk) files using the batch-scripted tool. AndRev tool is used to decompile apks in batch mode. Features have been stored in feature vectors. Firstly, analysis is done using feature vectors to study the pattern of permissions in applications as per the category. Two categories of apks, namely general and entertainment apps, are studied with an initial dataset of 50 applications each. Secondly, do an experimental study of applications permission removal by using a reverse engineering method. Updated apks are recompiled apps, which execute on a mobile phone as the way it executes like the original app. The study consists of ten apps from Google Play with various categories. The study concludes that it is not easy to remove permission as per the type of permission and the relation of apps permission with app’s relevant functionality. Finally, performed security analysis on the vulnerabilities within the source code, and those are used for accessing resources or unauthorized permission authorization of Android apk. For the study, many vulnerabilities based features were extracted by vulnerability assessment tool Quixxi for the Android application (apk) files. The study depicts that medium-risk vulnerabilities are higher than high- and low-risk vulnerabilities. In security analysis point of view, observations concluded would be useful to future Android app developers",

The conventional methods of malware detection are incompetent to detect new and generic malware. In this article, a generic malware detection process is proposed using machine learning named AndroHealthCheck. The malware detection process is divided into four phases, namely android file collection, decompilation, feature mining and machine learning. The overall contributions made in AndroHealthCheck are as follows: (1) designing and implementing a crawler for automating the process of benign files download, (2) collection of unstructured data from the downloaded APK files through the decompilation process, (3) defining a proper mechanism for the feature selection process by performing a static analysis process, (4) designing and implementing a feature mining script for extracting the features from unstructured data collection from APK files, (5) generating a rich homemade data set for machine learning with a huge variety and different flavours of malware files from different families and (6) evaluating the performance of the generated data set by using different types of supervised machine learning classifiers. In this article, the overall architecture and deployment flow of AndroHealthCheck are also discussed.",

In this paper, we extend our previous research work titled “Anatomizing Android Malwares” [ 20 ] and bring forward a novel method of identifying malicious android apps using object-oriented software metrics and supervised machine learning techniques. Initially, we retrieve object-oriented software metrics from the decompiled android app, and then this metrics tuple is tagged either as benign or malware using VirusTotal service. Finally, the set of metrics tuple acts as input features in machine learning algorithms. We evaluated the performance and stability of our forty-eight different machine-learned models against 5774 android apps collected from AndroZoo [ 1 ]. The discriminatory power of every machine-learned model is measured using its area under ROC curve (AUC), accuracy and F -measure values.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of mobile internet and the increasing number of smartphone users, various applications have become easily accessible. Although most mobile applications publish corresponding privacy policies before being re-leased on app markets, there persists a critical issue of inconsistency between declared privacy policies and actual application behaviors, leading to user privacy breaches. This makes the detection and analysis of privacy leakage behaviors in Android applications and their third-party libraries an urgent research challenge. Natural Language Processing (NLP), which focuses on enabling effective human-machine interaction through natural language, proves particularly suitable for analyzing decompiled Android bytecode as an inspection medium. By employing NLP-based semantic analysis for static code examination, this research addresses privacy leakage detection in Android applications. This paper presents an NLP-based system for detecting consistency between application privacy policies and behaviors. The system utilizes NLP techniques to extract and process privacy-related declarations from policy documents and sensitive behaviors from applications. Through static analysis, it distinguishes actual sensitive behaviors and private data handling between core applications and third-party libraries. The system establishes a correlation model by mapping permission requirements with privacy information disclosures, ultimately achieving consistency verification. For experimental validation, we selected 100 Chinese mobile applications and their third-party libraries. Experimental results reveal that approximately 80\\% of applications exhibited inconsistencies between documented policies and actual behaviors (including third-party components).",

    "abstract": "Ethereum ERC-20 smart contracts are now widely utilized in various domains for trust and transparent transaction process. However, ERC-20 contracts face significant security risks, particularly backdoors that can lead to severe incidents. In backdoor attacks, malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform unauthorized transactions, steal funds, or manipulate token balances, resulting in substantial financial losses and damaging trust of blockchain system. This paper introduces MDetector, a tool for efficiently detecting backdoors in ERC-20 contracts through static analysis. Firstly, MDetector defines 9 basic and 3 complex types of backdoors, covering existing potential risks. Based on these definitions, MDetector runs corresponding detection logic via datalog analysis. Secondly, MDetector is compatible with Solidity versions 0.4 to 0.8.24 and can be deployed on Linux, Windows and Android. Thirdly, MDetector initiates a high-performance decompilation engine to disassemble and convert contract bytecode into intermediate code. The experimental results demonstrate its high precision and reliability, achieving an accuracy of 94.0\\% in an average of just 1.3 s. This represents a significant improvement over the most advanced scientific tools currently available, achieving approximately 1.55 \\\\(\\\\times \\\\) greater accuracy and 6.17 \\\\(\\\\times \\\\) faster processing speed.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts on Ethereum have driven the development of decentralized financial applications, but they have also become a breeding ground for fraudulent activities, particularly Ponzi schemes. These schemes often obscure the flow of funds and the relationships among participants, making their true nature difficult to detect–especially when only the contract’s bytecode is publicly available. Conventional detection methods largely depend on access to source code or large-scale labeled datasets to train supervised learning models. However, in real-world blockchain environments, only compiled bytecode is typically accessible on-chain, and obtaining labeled data is costly and often impractical. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach to identify Ponzi schemes directly from Ethereum bytecode, without relying on source code or labeled data. Under a zero-shot setting, we utilize large language models to interpret and assess critical code fragments extracted from the contract, aiming to judge whether their functionality matches typical Ponzi-like fund behaviors. Our method first decompiles the bytecode into an intermediate form that preserves key semantic information, then constructs a data flow graph to represent data dependencies and control flow relationships within the contract. Based on this graph, we apply a set of manually defined rules to locate and extract code segments that are strongly related to fund transfer logic. These segments are then provided to the language model for further reasoning and judgment. By integrating bytecode analysis with LLM-based interpretation, our method can detect suspicious fund flow patterns even when the original source code is not available.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the deep integration of cyber systems with physical systems, power systems are gradually evolving towards Cyber-Physical Power System (CPPS). However, the proliferation of IoT devices has expanded the system’s attack surface, allowing malware to infiltrate and compromise CPPS operation. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct research on malware detection specifically for CPPS. Current detection methods, however, have certain limitations, such as difficulty in analyzing IoT malware across multiple CPU architectures and insufficient opcode feature extraction. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-CPU architecture IoT malware detection approach based on Intermediate Representation (IR). The approach consists of a binary lifting model, an IR deduplication model, and a deep learning classification model. The binary lifting model performs in-depth malware opcode analysis and outputs them as higher-level IR, facilitating malware processing across different CPU architectures. Due to significant redundancy in the IR output, an IR deduplication model is designed to optimize the IR, ensuring high-quality data input for the classification model. The deep learning classification model processes the deduplicated IR using word embedding techniques, employs a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) for dimensionality reduction, and utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for malware classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IR-based multi-CPU architecture malware detection approach can more effectively identify and classify malware across different architectures, thereby enhancing detection accuracy.",

    "abstract": "VR devices are a rapidly emerging type of sensory terminal device in the context of the metaverse, with its immersive use effects attracting a large number of users to experience. However, with the continuous development of virtual reality technology, an increasing number of criminal incidents in the virtual world have raised concerns. VR devices are developed based on the Android system but have their unique security mechanisms. Therefore, how to securely extract and preserve data from VR devices is a crucial concern for digital forensic practitioners. This paper first proposes a method for application data extraction and analysis in a non root environment within the VR ecosystem based on the Linux shared user id mechanism. This method utilizes Edge Developer Tools to debug Vuplex 3D Webview, enabling the extraction of internal storage data from embedded web pages within the application. Subsequently, a combination of decompilation and packet capture techniques is used to analyze the data transmission methods and data interaction logic of applications in the VR ecosystem. Finally, based on the experimental results, a comprehensive assessment of the security of VR devices is conducted in the paper. Data extraction from VR devices is an indispensable part of digital forensics in the era of the metaverse. The research on methods for extracting and analyzing application data in the VR ecosystem in this paper provides valuable reference for future forensic work on VR devices.",

    "abstract": "For the Android app market, malware uses code encryption techniques for block detection. For Android applications, scholars have proposed a method to determine whether Android applications are malicious software by analyzing the behavioral characteristics of software operation. The most traditional method is static detection, which is characterized by fast detection speed and less resource occupation. However, Android software cannot be detected by static methods after using encryption technology. The APK package of the application is first decompiled to detect and extract key features, behavioral patterns, and invocation information using Frida and Camille. Subsequently, the long short-term memory network (LSTM) is employed to analyze software intent for determining the presence of malware. The experimental results demonstrate that the static method achieves an accuracy of approximately 80\\%, whereas the dynamic method achieves an accuracy of 91\\%. Through the utilization of software intention analysis and permission usage checks in combination, the accuracy rate can be further enhanced to 94\\%. Upon comparison of the different algorithms utilized in each detection method, it is concluded that both the KNN and random forest algorithms exhibit higher accuracy in the application of such detection methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of converting a flat CMOS circuit of transistors in the SPICE format into a hierarchical circuit of CMOS gates in the same format. This problem arises in the process of layout versus schematic (LVS) verification, as well as when reengineering integrated circuits. A method for recognizing subcircuits (CMOS gates) is described. The method is implemented as a C++ program; it recognizes subcircuits that are described by the same logic functions but are not isomorphic at the transistor level as different ones. This provides the isomorphism of the original and decompiled circuits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Android OS is today the most used Operating System for mobile devices. However, it is susceptible to several malware attacks that may seriously compromise the privacy and security of individuals and organizations. This paper proposes an approach based on a static analysis of decompiled Android PacKages (APKs) to extract critical APIs and detect Android malware. The main contributions lie in the adoption of a graph-based data engineering schema to represent APIs taken from the Function Call Graphs of decompiled APKs and the formulation of a graph-based deep learning approach for explainable malware detection. In particular, the proposed approach, named , implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for binary classification (malware versus goodware), and integrates algorithm to disclose how specific API classes and control-flow edges between API calls influence malware alerts. The proposed approach was evaluated by considering 26,527 Android APKs. The results of an extensive and in-depth evaluation show that the presented GNN model achieves higher accuracy than deep neural models trained with traditional API call sequence representations and publicly available related methods. On the other hand, it produces decision explanations that yield interesting insights into the malicious patterns of APKs and support root cause analysis of missed malware alarms.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in LLM-based decompilers have been shown effective to convert low-level binaries into human-readable source code. However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLM decompilation technology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Decompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmark Decompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues. We further explore commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide a thorough assessment of the studied LLM decompilers and find that fine-tuning with Decompile-Bench causes a 20% improvement over previous benchmarks in terms of the re-executability rate.

    "abstract": "While Vision-language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong semantic capabilities, their ability to interpret the underlying geometric structure of visual information is less explored. Pictographic characters, which combine visual form with symbolic structure, provide an ideal test case for this capability. We formulate this visual recognition challenge in the mathematical domain, where each character is represented by an executable program of geometric primitives. This is framed as a program synthesis task, training a VLM to decompile raster images into programs composed of Bézier curves. Our model, acting as a \"visual decompiler\", demonstrates performance superior to strong zero-shot baselines, including GPT-4o. The most significant finding is that when trained solely on modern Chinese characters, the model is able to reconstruct ancient Oracle Bone Script in a zero-shot context. This generalization provides strong evidence that the model acquires an abstract and transferable geometric grammar, moving beyond pixel-level pattern recognition to a more structured form of visual understanding.

    "abstract": "With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has been paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various educational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on blockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by developers for its ``event-triggered\" mechanism for building education intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified, so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly, the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG) are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the vulnerability detection of smart contracts. Compared with the traditional approaches, it can get good results with fewer layers of the GCN model, which shows that the contract bytecode and GCN model are efficient in vulnerability detection. ",

    "abstract": "As the quality of crucial entities can directly affect that of software,\ntheir identification and protection become an important premise for\neffective software development, management, maintenance and testing,\nwhich thus contribute to improving the software quality and its\nattack-defending ability. Most analysis and evaluation on important\nentities like codes-based static structure analysis are on the\ndestruction of the actual software running. In this paper, from the\nperspective of software execution process, we proposed an approach to\nmine dynamic noteworthy functions (DNFM) in software execution\nsequences. First, accord-ing to software decompiling and tracking stack\nchanges, the execution traces composed of a series of function addresses\nwere acquired. Then these traces were modeled as execution sequences and\nthen simplified so as to get simplified sequences (SFS), followed by the\nextraction of patterns through pattern extraction (PE) algorithm from\nSFS. After that, evalu-ating indicators inner-importance and\ninter-importance were designed to measure the note-worthiness of\nfunctions in DNFM algorithm. Finally, these functions were sorted by\ntheir noteworthiness. Comparison and contrast were conducted on the\nexperiment results from two traditional complex network-based node\nmining methods, namely PageRank and DegreeRank. The results show that\nthe DNFM method can mine noteworthy functions in software effectively\nand precisely.",

    "abstract": "Android provides a permission declaration and a certification mechanism\nto detect and report potential security threats of applications.\nNormally, an application is certified based on its declared permissions,\nbut declared permissions are often coarse-grained or inconsistent with\nthose actually used in the program code. The authors propose application\nprogramming interface (API)-level security certification of android\napplications (ASCAA), a cloud-based framework, which employs a\nsystematic method to identify and analyse security threats at API level.\nTo certify an application, ASCAA examines all permission labels in its\nmanifest and API invocations extracted from its decompiled code based on\na set of requirementdependent security rules. In addition, the authors\nprovide ASCAA Security Language to formalise security rules and the\ncertification process, which makes ASCAA general and scalable. Since it\nis a cloud-based framework, any potential user could easily make ASCAA\nwork for them, and ASCAA has also been proved to gain high performance.\nHitherto, they have analysed over 200 applications with an automated\ntool based on ASCAA, and discovered that about one-eighth failed to pass\npart of our sample rules. We find evidence that ASCAA can identify risk\nfactors in a fine-grained way, for example, applications' being over\nprivileged or the use of some dangerous APIs require no permission\ndeclaration.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of performing fast and accurate\ntitrations with end points that are difficult to identify. In this\nsense, the combination of digital movies (DMs) with a flow-batch\nanalyzer (FBA) has shown to be a promising analytical tool. In a digital\nmovie-based automatic titrator (DMB-AT), a DM is recorded by a webcam as\nthe titrant is added in the mixing chamber (MC). The DM is then\ndecompiled into frames that are ordered sequentially. In the first\nframe, the region of interest (ROI) of 257 x 255 pixels is defined. The\nred (R) component is used to calculate the Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient (r) between the first frame and each subsequent one. The\ntitration curve is obtained in real time by plotting r values and the\nopening time of the titrant valve. The experimental titration curve is\nfitted in a sigmoidal regression, and the new titration curve is used to\nestimate the end point by means of the second derivative method. A\nsoftware program written in Adobe AIR for a desktop platform programmed\nin ActionScript 3.0 controlled the opening time of the solenoid valves,\ngathered the analytical signal and carried out the analytical procedure\nin real time. The feasibility of the method was confirmed by determining\nthe total hardness and the total alkalinity in mineral waters. The\nresults were compared with classical batch titration and did not exhibit\nstatistically significant differences when the paired t-test at the 95\\%\nconfidence level was applied. The proposed method is able to process\napproximately 67 and 86 samples H-1 for total hardness and total\nalkalinity, respectively. Its precision was confirmed by overall\nrelative standard deviation (RSD) values of less than 1.0\\% in both\napplications. Published by Elsevier B.V.",

    "abstract": "Android is now the most popular smartphone platform and remains rapid\ngrowth. There are huge number of sensitive privacy information stored in\nAndroid devices. Kinds of methods have been proposed to detect Android\nmalicious applications and protect the privacy information. In this\nwork, we focus on extracting the fine-grained features to maximize the\ninformation of Android malware detection, and selecting the least joint\nfeatures to minimize the number of features. Firstly, permissions and\nAPIs, not only from Android permissions and SDK APIs but also from the\ndeveloper-defined permissions and third-party library APIs, are\nextracted as features from the decompiled source codes. Secondly,\nfeature selection methods, including information gain (IG),\nregularization and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms, are\nused to analyze and utilize the correlation between the features to\neliminate the redundant data, reduce the feature dimension and mine the\nuseful joint features. Furthermore, regularization and PSO are\nintegrated to create a new joint feature mining method. Experiment\nresults show that the joint feature mining method can utilize the\nadvantages of regularization and PSO, and ensure good performance and\nefficiency for Android malware detection.",

    "abstract": "Mobile security is an important issue on Android platform. Most malware\ndetection methods based on machine learning models heavily rely on\nexpert knowledge for manual feature engineering, which are still\ndifficult to fully describe malwares. In this paper, we present\nLSTM-based hierarchical denoise network (HDN), a novel static Android\nmalware detection method which uses LSTM to directly learn from the raw\nopcode sequences extracted from decompiled Android files. However, most\nopcode sequences are too long for LSTM to train due to the gradient\nvanishing problem. Hence, HDN uses a hierarchical structure, whose\nfirst-level LSTM parallelly computes on opcode subsequences (we called\nthem method blocks) to learn the dense representations; then the\nsecond-level LSTM can learn and detect malware through method block\nsequences. Considering that malicious behavior only appears in partial\nsequence segments, HDN uses method block denoise module (MBDM) for data\ndenoising by adaptive gradient scaling strategy based on loss cache. We\nevaluate and compare HDN with the latest mainstream researches on three\ndatasets. The results show that HDN outperforms these Android malware\ndetection methods, and it is able to capture longer sequence features\nand has better detection efficiency than N-gram-based malware detection\nwhich is similar to our method.",

    "abstract": "Software security of Android applications is especially susceptible\n(vulnerable) to malicious reverse engineer than the native code based\nsoftware, because its Java bytecode is easier to decompile and to\nreconstruct the original Java source code. Therefore obfuscation is an\nessential criterion for the protection of Android applications.\nMeanwhile, the unpredicted performance loss will be caused by the\nobfuscation, which might seriously influence the user experience of the\nsoftware. Therefore the obfuscation degree and the performance cost out\nof it require being optimized. In this paper, we are working on the\nproblem that: to obfuscate an Android application to a target level of\n``difficulty{''} degree, while not substantially ``slowing it down{''}.\nWe measure ``difficulty{''} by utilizing software complexity metrics and\nthe ``slow{''} in CPU cycles. Within the framework designed for\nobfuscating Android applications, we implement the ``Naive Bayesian\nClassifier{''} algorithm for the optimized obfuscation of the software\ncomplexity and the performance, and show that it outperforms the\nalgorithm whose predictions rely on mean values. We furthermore\ninvestigate the performance penalty imposed by obfuscation process when\nframework targets different complexity values and metrics. We show that\nsome obfuscation methods are more performance costly than others to\nachieve the same metric value increase. Our result shows that, for any\ngiven software complexity, the required performance benefits can be\nachieved if the right obfuscation techniques are used. (C) 2017 Elsevier\nLtd.

Recent\nresearches mainly use machine learning based methods heavily relying on\ndomain knowledge for manually extracting malicious features. In this\npaper, we propose MalNet, a novel malware detection method that learns\nfeatures automatically from the raw data. Concretely, we first generate\na grayscale image from malware file, meanwhile extracting its opcode\nsequences with the decompilation tool IDA. Then MalNet uses CNN and LSTM\nnetworks to learn from grayscale image and opcode sequence,\nrespectively, and takes a stacking ensemble for malware classification.\nWe perform experiments on more than 40,000 samples including 20,650\nbenign files collected from online software providers and 21,736\nmalwares provided by Microsoft. The evaluation result shows that MalNet\nachieves 99.88\\% validation accuracy for malware detection. In addition,\nwe also take malware family classification experiment on 9 malware\nfamilies to compare MalNet with other related works, in which MalNet\noutperforms most of related works with 99.36\\% detection accuracy and\nachieves a considerable speed-up on detecting efficiency comparing with\ntwo state-of-the-art results on Microsoft malware dataset.",

    "abstract": "Copying and pasting of source code is a common activity in software\nengineering. Often, the code is not copied as it is and it may be\nmodified for various purposes; e.g. refactoring, bug fixing, or even\nsoftware plagiarism. These code modifications could affect the\nperformance of code similarity analysers including code clone and\nplagiarism detectors to some certain degree. We are interested in two\ntypes of code modification in this study: pervasive modifications, i.e.\ntransformations that may have a global effect, and local modifications,\ni.e. code changes that are contained in a single method or code block.\nWe evaluate 30 code similarity detection techniques and tools using five\nexperimental scenarios for Java source code. These are (1) pervasively\nmodified code, created with tools for source code and bytecode\nobfuscation, and boiler-plate code, (2) source code normalisation\nthrough compilation and decompilation using different decompilers, (3)\nreuse of optimal configurations over different data sets, (4) tool\nevaluation using ranked-based measures, and (5) local + global code\nmodifications. Our experimental results show that in the presence of\npervasive modifications, some of the general textual similarity measures\ncan offer similar performance to specialised code similarity tools,\nwhilst in the presence of boiler-plate code, highly specialised source\ncode similarity detection techniques and tools outperform textual\nsimilarity measures. Our study strongly validates the use of\ncompilation/decompilation as a normalisation technique. Its use reduced\nfalse classifications to zero for three of the tools. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that optimal configurations are very sensitive to a specific\ndata set. After directly applying optimal configurations derived from\none data set to another, the tools perform poorly on the new data set.\nThe code similarity analysers are thoroughly evaluated not only based on\nseveral well-known pair-based and query-based error measures but also on\neach specific type of pervasive code modification. This broad, thorough\nstudy is the largest in existence and potentially an invaluable guide\nfor future users of similarity detection in source code.",

In order to detect Android malware\neffectively, this paper proposes a novel lightweight static detection\nmodel, TinyDroid, using instruction simplification and machine learning\ntechnique. First, a symbol-based simplification method is proposed to\nabstract the opcode sequence decompiled from Android Dalvik Executable\nfiles. Then, N-gram is employed to extract features from the simplified\nopcode sequence, and a classifier is trained for the malware detection\nand classification tasks. To improve the efficiency and scalability of\nthe proposed detection model, a compression procedure is also used to\nreduce features and select exemplars for the malware sample datasct.\nTinyDroid is compared against the state-of-the-art antivirus tools in\nreal world using Drebin dataset. The experimental results show that\nTinyDroid can get a higher accuracy rate and lower false alarm rate with\nsatisfied efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Mobile app ads pose a far greater security threat to users than adverts\non computer browsers. This is because app developers must embed a\nSoftware Development Kit (SDK), called an ad library or ad lib for\nshort, provided by ad networks (i.e., ad companies) into their app\nprogram, and then merge and compile it into an Android PacKage (APK)\nexecution file. The ad lib thus becomes a part of the entire app, and\nshares the whole permissions granted to the app. Unfortunately, this\nalso resulted in many security issues, such as ad libs abusing the\npermissions to collect and leak private data, ad servers redirecting ad\nrequests to download malicious JavaScript from unknown servers to\nexecute it in the background of the mobile operating system without the\nuser's consent. The more well-known an embedded ad lib, the safer the\napp may be, and vice versa. Importantly, while decompiling an APK to\ninspect its source code may not identify the ad lib(s), executing the\napp on a simulator can reveal the network behavior of the embedded ad\nlib(s). Ad libs exhibit different behavior patterns when communicating\nwith ad servers. This study uses a dynamic analysis method to inspect an\nexecuting app, and plots the ad lib behavior patterns related to the\nadvertisement into a graph. It is then determined whether or not the ad\nlib is from a trusted ad network using comparisons of graph\nsimilarities.",

    "abstract": "Software defect prediction locates defective code to help developers\nimprove the security of software. However, existing studies on software\ndefect prediction are mostly limited to the source code. Defect\nprediction for Android binary executables (called apks) has never been\nexplored in previous studies. In this paper, we propose an explorative\nstudy of defect prediction in Android apks. We first propose smali2vec,\na new approach to generate features that capture the characteristics of\nsmali (decompiled files of apks) files in apks. Smali2vec extracts both\ntoken and semantic features of the defective files in apks and such\ncomprehensive features are needed for building accurate prediction\nmodels. Then we leverage deep neural network (DNN), which is one of the\nmost common architecture of deep learning networks, to train and build\nthe defect prediction model in order to achieve accuracy. We apply our\ndefect prediction model to more than 90,000 smali files from 50 Android\napks and the results show that our model could achieve an AUC (the area\nunder the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 85.98\\% and it is\ncapable of predicting defects in apks. Furthermore, the DNN is proved to\nhave a better performance than the traditional shallow machine learning\nalgorithms (e.g., support vector machine and naive bayes) used in\nprevious studies. The model has been used in our practical work and\nhelped locate many defective files in apks.",

    "abstract": "Pirated application developers find an alternate way to publish pirated\nversions of the same Android mobile applications (apps) on different\nAndroid markets. Therefore, a centralized, automated scrutiny system\namong multiple app stores is inevitable to prevent publishing pirated or\ncloned version of these Android applications. In this paper, we proposed\nan Android clone detection system for Internet of things (IoT)\n(Droid-IoT) devices. First, the proposed system receives an original\nAndroid application package (APK) file along with possible candidate\ncloned APKs over the cloud network. The system uses an apkExtractor tool\nto extract Dalvik Executable (DEX) files for each subject program. The\nJdex decompiler is used to extract Java source files from DEXs. Then,\nthe bag-of-word model is used to extract tokenized features from source\nfiles. Further, the weighting filters are used to zoom the importance of\neach token. Moreover, Synthetic Minority Oversampling is applied to\nretrieve balanced features for better training of data. Finally,\nTensorFlow with Keras deep learning model is designed to predict clones\nin Android applications. The experimental results have shown that\nDroid-IoT can successfully detect cloned apps with an accuracy of up to\n96\\%. The primary purpose of this system is to prevent the publishing of\npirated apps among different app stores under different pirated names.",

    "abstract": "Android usually employs the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to\nprotect the user's privacy in network transmission. However, developers\nmay misuse SSL-related APIs, which would lead attackers to steal user's\nprivacy through man-in-the-middle attacks. Existing methods based on\nstatic decompiling technology to detect SSL security vulnerabilities of\nAndroid applications cannot cope with the increasingly common packed\napplications. Meanwhile, dynamic analysis approaches have the\ndisadvantages of excessive resource consumption and time-consuming. In\nthis paper, we propose a dynamic method to solve this issue based on our\nnovel automatic traversal model. At first, we propose several new\ntraversal strategies to optimize the widget tree according to the user\ninterface (UI) types and the interface state similarity. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a more granular traversal model by refining the traversal level\nfrom the Activity component to the Widget and implement a heuristic\ndepth-first traversal algorithm in combination with our customized\ntraversal strategy. In addition, the man-in-the-middle agent plug-in is\nextended to implement real-time attack test and return the attack\nresults. Based on the above ideas, we have implemented SSLDetecter, an\nefficient automated detection system of Android application SSL security\nvulnerability. We apply it on multiple devices in parallel to detect\n2456 popular applications in several mainstream application markets and\nfind that 424 applications are suffering from SSL security\nvulnerabilities. Compared with the existing system SMV-HUNTER, the time\nefficiency of our system increases by 38\\% and the average detection\nrate increases by 6.39 percentage points, with many types of SSL\nvulnerabilities detected.",

    "abstract": "Due to people in companies use mobile devices to access corporate data,\nattackers targeting corporate data use vulnerabilities in mobile\ndevices. Most vulnerabilities in applications are caused by the\ncarelessness of developers, and confused deputy attacks and data leak\nattacks using inter-application vulnerabilities are possible. These\nvulnerabilities are difficult to find through the single-application\ndiagnostic tool that is currently being studied. This paper proposes a\nprocess to automate the decompilation of all the applications on a\nuser's mobile device and a mechanism to find inter-application\nvulnerabilities. The mechanism generates a list and matrix, detailing\nthe vulnerabilities in the mobile device. The proposed mechanism is\nvalidated through an experiment on an actual mobile device with four\ninstalled applications, and the results show that the mechanism can\naccurately capture all application risks as well as inter-application\nrisks. Through this mechanism, users can expect to find the risks in\ntheir mobile devices in advance and prevent damage.",

    "abstract": "Infringing intellectual property by reverse analysis is a severe threat\nto Android applications. By replacing the program instructions with\nvirtual instructions that an adversary is unfamiliar with, code\nobfuscation based on virtualization is a promising way of protecting\nAndroid applications against reverse engineering. However, the current\ncode virtualization approaches for Android only target at the DEX\nbytecode level. The DEX file with the open file format and more semantic\ninformation makes the decode-dispatch pattern easier to expose, which\nhas been identified as a severe vulnerability of security and can be\nexploited by various attacks. Further, decode-dispatch interpretation\nfrequently uses indirect branches in this structure to introduce extra\noverhead. This paper presents a novel approach to transfer code\nvirtualization from DEX level to native level, which possesses strong\nsecurity strength and good stealth, with only modest cost. Our approach\ncontains two components: pre-compilation and compile-time\nvirtualization. Pre-compilation is designed for performance improvement\nby identifying and decompiling the critical functions which consume a\nsignificant fraction of execution time. Compile-time virtualization\nbuilds upon the widely used LLVM compiler framework. It automatically\ntranslates the DEX bytecode into the common LLVM intermediate\nrepresentations where a unified code virtualization pass can be applied\nfor DEX code. We have implemented a working prototype Dex2VM of our\ntechnique and applied it to eight representative Android applications.\nOur experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively\nprotect the target code against a state-of-the-art code reverse\nengineering tool that is specifically designed for code virtualization,\nand it achieves good stealth with only modest cost.

    "abstract": "Due to the increasing growth in the variety of Android malware, it is\nimportant to distinguish between the unique types of each. In this\npaper, we introduce the use of a decompiled source code for malicious\ncode classification. This decompiled source code provides deeper\nanalysis opportunities and understanding of the nature of malware.\nMalicious code differs from text due to syntax rules of compilers and\nthe effort of attackers to evade potential detection. Hence, we adapt\nNatural Language Processing-based techniques under some constraints for\nmalicious code classification. First, the proposed methodology\ndecompiles the Android Package Kit files, then API calls, keywords, and\nnon-obfuscated tokens are extracted from the source code and categorized\nto stop-tokens, feature-tokens, and long-tail-tokens. We also introduce\nthe use of generalized N-tokens to represent tokens that are typically\nless frequent. Our approach was evaluated, in comparison to the use of\nAPI calls and permissions for features, as a baseline, and their\ncombination, as well as in comparison to the use of neural network\narchitectures based on decompiled Android Package Kits. A rigorous\nevaluation of comprehensive public real-world Android malware datasets,\nincluding 24,553 apps that were categorized to 71 families for the\nmalicious families classification, and 60,000 apps for malicious code\ndetection was performed. Our approach outperformed the baselines in both\ntasks. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "During compilation from Java source code to bytecode, some information\nis irreversibly lost. In other words, compilation and decompilation of\nJava code is not symmetric. Consequently, decompilation, which aims at\nproducing source code from bytecode, relies on strategies to reconstruct\nthe information that has been lost. Different Java decompilers use\ndistinct strategies to achieve proper decompilation. In this work, we\nhypothesize that the diverse ways in which bytecode can be decompiled\nhas a direct impact on the quality of the source code produced by\ndecompilers.\nIn this paper, we assess the strategies of eight Java decompilers with\nrespect to three quality indicators: syntactic correctness, syntactic\ndistortion and semantic equivalence modulo inputs. Our results show that\nno single modern decompiler is able to correctly handle the variety of\nbytecode structures coming from real-world programs. The highest ranking\ndecompiler in this study produces syntactically correct, and\nsemantically equivalent code output for 84\\%, respectively 78\\%, of the\nclasses in our dataset. Our results demonstrate that each decompiler\ncorrectly handles a different set of bytecode classes.\nWe propose a new decompiler called Arlecchino that leverages the\ndiversity of existing decompilers. To do so, we merge partial\ndecompilation into a new one based on compilation errors. Arlecchino\nhandles 37.6\\% of bytecode classes that were previously handled by no\ndecompiler. We publish the sources of this new bytecode decompiler. (C)\n2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.",

    "abstract": "The number of malware has exploded due to the openness of the Android\nplatform, and the endless stream of malware poses a threat to the\nprivacy, tariffs, and device of mobile phone users. A novel Android\nmobile malware detection system is proposed, which employs an optimized\ndeep convolutional neural network to learn from opcode sequences. The\noptimized convolutional neural network is trained multiple times by the\nraw opcode sequences extracted from the decompiled Android file, so that\nthe feature information can be effectively learned and the malicious\nprogram can be detected more accurately. More critically, thek-max\npooling method with better results is adopted in the pooling operation\nphase, which improves the detection effect of the proposed method. The\nexperimental results show that the detection system achieved the\naccuracy of 99\\%, which is 2\\%-11\\% higher than the accuracy of the\nmachine learning detection algorithms when using the same data set. It\nalso ensures that the indicators, such as F1-score, recall, and\nprecision, are maintained above 97\\%. Based on the detection system, a\nmulti-data set comparison experiment is carried out. The introducedk-max\npooling is deeply studied, and the effect ofkofk-max pooling on the\noverall detection effect is observed.",

    "abstract": "The fast-growing Android application market has attracted more and more\napplication developers. However, many plagiarists use decompiled tools\nto modify original applications to get clones, which has become a\nserious threat. For detecting cloned applications, most of the existing\nschemes do not consider the detected accuracy and time consumption at\nthe same time. In this article, we proposea two-phase detection scheme\nto achieve fast and accurate clone detection in large-scale\napplications. In the rapid screening phase, a fix-length minhash summary\nis constructed for each application and the locality-sensitive hashing\n(LSH) algorithm is used to obtain suspicious cloned applications\nquickly. In the accurate detection phase, by merging and pruning the\nlayout and interaction information of all user interfaces (UIs) at the\napplication runtime, we obtain the birthmark named merged layout tree\n(MLT), which can resist nested obfuscation and repacking attack.\nFinally, cloned apps are detected by calculating the similarity between\nMLTs from suspicious cloned apps. We evaluate our detection scheme in\ntwo app datasets (nearly 170,000 Android applications) and compare it\nwith the state-of-the-art clone detection methods. Extensive experiments\nshow that our method has high accuracy and efficiency for clone\ndetection in large-scale apps.",

    "abstract": "In industrial control systems (ICS), attackers inject malicious\ncontrol-logic into programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to sabotage\nphysical processes, such as nuclear plants, traffic-light signals,\nelevators, and conveyor belts. For instance, Stuxnet operates by\ntransfering control logic to Siemens S7-300 PLCs over the network to\nmanipulate the motor speed of centrifuges. These devestating attacks are\nreferred to as control-logic injection attacks. Their network traffic,\nif captured, contains malicious control logic that can be leveraged as a\nforensic artifact. In this paper, we present Reditus to recover control\nlogic from a suspicious ICS network traffic. Reditus is based on the\nobservation that an engineering software has a built-in decompiler that\ncan transform the control logic into its source-code. Reditus integrates\nthe decompiler with a (previously-captured) set of network traffic from\na control-logic to recover the source code of the binary control-logic\nautomatically. We evaluate Reditus on the network traffic of 40 control\nlogic programs transferred from the SoMachine Basic engineering software\nto a Modicon M221 PLC. Our evaluation successfully demonstrates that\nReditus can recover the source-code of a control logic from its network\ntraffic. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of\nDFRWS.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND:\nThe bispectral index (BIS) monitor has been available for clinical use\nfor >20 years and has had an immense impact on academic activity in\nAnesthesiology, with >3000 articles referencing the bispectral index.\nDespite attempts to infer its algorithms by external observation, its\noperation has nevertheless remained undescribed, in contrast to the\nalgorithms of other less commercially successful monitors of\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) activity under anesthesia. With the\nexpiration of certain key patents, the time is therefore ripe to examine\nthe operation of the monitor on its own terms through careful\ndismantling, followed by extraction and examination of its internal\nsoftware.\nMETHODS:\nAn A-2000 BIS Monitor (gunmetal blue case, amber monochrome display) was\npurchased on the secondary market. After identifying the major data\nprocessing and storage components, a set of free or inexpensive tools\nwas used to retrieve and disassemble the monitor's onboard software. The\nsoftware executes primarily on an ARMv7 microprocessor (Sharp/NXP\nLH77790B) and a digital signal processor (Texas Instruments TMS320C32).\nThe device software can be retrieved directly from the monitor's\nhardware by using debugging interfaces that have remained in place from\nits original development.\nRESULTS:\nCritical numerical parameters such as the spectral edge frequency (SEF),\ntotal power, and BIS values were retraced from external delivery at the\ndevice's serial port back to the point of their calculation in the\nextracted software. In doing so, the locations of the critical\nalgorithms were determined. To demonstrate the validity of the\ntechnique, the algorithms for SEF and total power were disassembled,\ncomprehensively annotated and compared to their theoretically ideal\nbehaviors. A bug was identified in the device's implementation of the\nSEF algorithm, which can be provoked by a perfectly isoelectric EEG.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis article demonstrates that the electronic design of the A-2000 BIS\nMonitor does not pose any insuperable obstacles to retrieving its device\nsoftware in hexadecimal machine code form directly from the motherboard.\nThis software can be reverse engineered through disassembly and\ndecompilation to reveal the methods by which the BIS monitor implements\nits algorithms, which ultimately must form the definitive statement of\nits function. Without further revealing any algorithms that might be\nconsidered trade secrets, the manufacturer of the BIS monitor should be\nencouraged to release the device software in its original format to\nplace BIS-related academic literature on a firm theoretical foundation\nand to promote further academic development of EEG monitoring\nalgorithms.",

    "abstract": "Purpose The online platform is one of the essential components of the\nplatform economy that is constructed by a large scale of the personal\ndata resource. However, accurate empirical test of the competition\nstructure of the data-driven online platform is still less. This\nresearch is trying to reveal market allocation structure of the personal\ndata resource of China's car-hailing platforms competition by the\nempirical data analysis. Design/methodology/approach This research is\napplying the social network analysis by R packages, which include k-core\ndecomposition and multilevel community detection from the data\nconnectedness via the decompilation and the examination of the\napplication programming interface of terminal applications. Findings\nThis research has found that the car-hailing platforms, which establish\nmore constant personal data connectedness and connectivity with social\nmedia platforms, are taking the competitive market advantage within the\nsample network. Data access discrimination is a complementary method of\nmarket power in China's car-hailing industry. Research\nlimitations/implications This research offers a new perspective on the\nanalysis of the multi-sided market from the personal data resource\nallocation mechanism of the car-hailing platform. However, the\nmeasurement of the data connectedness requires more empirical industry\ndata. Practical implications This research reveals the competition\nstructure that relies on personal data resource allocation mechanism. It\noffers empirical evidence for governance, which is considered as the\ncritical issue of big data research, by reviewing the nature of the data\nnetwork. Social implications It also reveals the data convergence\nprocess of the social system and the technological system.\nOriginality/value This research offers a new research method for the\nreal-time regulation of the car-hailing platform.",

    "abstract": "Green and smart cities deliver services to their residents using mobile\napplications that make daily life more convenient. The privacy and\nsecurity of these applications are significant in providing sustainable\nservices in a green city. The software cloning is a severe threat which\nmay breach the security and privacy of android applications. A centrally\ncontrolled and automated screening system across multiple app stores is\ninevitable to prevent the release of copyrighted or cloned copies of\nthese apps. In this paper, we proposed IoT-enabled green city\narchitecture for clone detection in android markets using a deep\nlearning approach. First, the proposed system obtained an original APK\nfile together with potential candidate cloned APKs via the cloud\nnetwork. For each subject software, the system uses an APK Extractor\ntool to retrieve Dalvik Executable (DEX) files. The Jdex decompiler is\nutilized to retrieve Java source files through Dalvik Executables.\nSecond, the AST features are extracted using ANother Tool for Language\nRecognition (ANTLR) parser. Third, the linear features are mined from\nthese hierarchical structures, and Term Frequency Inverse Document\nFrequency (TFIDF) is applied to estimate the significance of each\nfeature. Finally, the deep learning model is configured to detect cloned\napps. The deep learning model is fine-tuned to get better accuracy. The\nproposed approach is analyzed on five different cloned applications\ncollected from different android markets. The main objective of this\nsystem is to avoid the release of pirated apps with various pirated\nlabels in multiple app markets. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights\nreserved.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of a large number of new malicious code poses a serious\nthreat to network security, and most of them are derivative versions of\nexisting malicious code. The classification of malicious code is helpful\nto analyze the evolutionary trend of malicious code families and trace\nthe source of cybercrime. The existing methods of malware classification\nemphasize the depth of the neural network, which has the problems of a\nlong training time and large computational cost. In this work, we\npropose the shallow neural network-based malware classifier (SNNMAC), a\nmalware classification model based on shallow neural networks and static\nanalysis. Our approach bridges the gap between precise but slow methods\nand fast but less precise methods in existing works. For each sample, we\nfirst generate n-grams from their opcode sequences of the binary file\nwith a decompiler. An improved n-gram algorithm based on control\ntransfer instructions is designed to reduce the n-gram dataset. Then,\nthe SNNMAC exploits a shallow neural network, replacing the full\nconnection layer and softmax with the average pooling layer and\nhierarchical softmax, to learn from the dataset and perform\nclassification. We perform experiments on the Microsoft malware dataset.\nThe evaluation result shows that the SNNMAC outperforms most of the\nrelated works with 99.21\\% classification precision and reduces the\ntraining time by more than half when compared with the methods using DNN\n(Deep Neural Networks).",

    "abstract": "Batik is a traditional handicraft of ethnic minorities in southwestern\nChina's Guizhou province. It carries distinctive features, and inherits\nprofound artistic and cultural values. However, the empirical design\nmodel of batik patterns is not fast or diverse enough to meet the highly\npersonalized market demands. Moreover, it is difficult to parametrize\nthe complex ethnic patterns with mathematical models. Hence, the design\nof batik patterns cannot satisfy the visual cognitive needs of\nconsumers, which are constantly changing, fuzzy, and personalized. In\nother words, the visual cognitive needs of consumers have not been fully\nconsidered in the parametrization and design of batik patterns. To solve\nthe problem, this paper puts forward a generative design method for\nbatik patterns based on shape grammar, and relies on the artificial\nneural network (ANN) to model the nonlinear mapping between design\nparameters and visual cognitive image (VCI) values. The three-layer ANN\nmodel was optimized with the genetic algorithm (GA) to generate new\npatterns, and optimize the composition of their VCIs. The workflow and\neffectiveness of the proposed method were explained and verified through\nexperiments on the generative design of bronze drum patterns, which have\nrich ethnic and religious connotations. The experimental results show\nthat our method can predict the VCI values of the composition, provide\nthe optimal parameter solution of the VCI values, and decompile the\nconceptual prototype from the pattern composition that best meets the\nvisual cognitive needs of consumers.

    "abstract": "The protection and privacy of the 5G-IoT framework is a major challenge\ndue to the vast number of mobile devices. Specialized applications\nrunning these 5G-IoT systems may be vulnerable to clone attacks. Cloning\napplications can be achieved by stealing or distributing commercial\nAndroid apps to harm the advanced services of the 5G-IoT framework.\nMeanwhile, most Android app stores run and manage Android apps that\ndevelopers have submitted separately without any central verification\nsystems. Android scammers sell pirated versions of commercial software\nto other app stores under different names. Android applications are\ntypically stored on cloud servers, while API access services may be used\nto detect and prevent cloned applications from being released. In this\npaper, we proposed a hybrid approach to the Control Flow Graph (CFG) and\na deep learning model to secure the smart services of the 5G-IoT\nframework. First, the newly submitted APK file is extracted and the JDEX\ndecompiler is used to retrieve Java source files from possibly original\nand cloned applications. Second, the source files are broken down into\nvarious android-based components. After generating Control-Flow Graphs\n(CFGs), the weighted features are stripped from each component. Finally,\nthe Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is designed to predict potential\ncloned applications by training features from different components of\nandroid applications. Experimental results have shown that the proposed\napproach can achieve an average accuracy of 96.24\\% for cloned\napplications selected from different android application stores.",

    "abstract": "The openness of Android operating system not only brings convenience to\nusers, but also leads to the attack threat from a large number of\nmalicious applications (apps). Thus malware detection has become the\nresearch focus in the field of mobile security. In order to solve the\nproblem of more coarse-grained feature selection and larger feature loss\nof graph structure existing in the current detection methods, we put\nforward a method named DGCNDroid for Android malware detection, which is\nbased on the deep graph convolutional network. Our method starts by\ngenerating a function call graph for the decompiled Android application.\nThen the function call subgraph containing the sensitive application\nprogramming interface (API) is extracted. Finally, the function call\nsubgraphs with structural features are trained as the input of the deep\ngraph convolutional network. Thus the detection and classification of\nmalicious apps can be realized. Through experimentation on a dataset\ncontaining 11,120 Android apps, the method proposed in this paper can\nachieve detection accuracy of 98.2\\%, which is higher than other\nexisting detection methods.",

Equally difficult are policy maintenance and\nrefactoring, as well as porting a configuration from one firewall system\nto another.\nTo address these issues we introduce a pipeline that assists system\nadministrators in checking if: (i) the intended security policy is\nactually implemented by a configuration; (ii) two configurations are\nequivalent; (iii) updates have the desired effect on the firewall\nbehavior; (iv) there are useless or redundant rules; additionally, an\nadministrator can (v) transcompile a configuration into an equivalent\none in a different language; and (vi) maintain a configuration using a\ngeneric, declarative language that can be compiled into different target\nlanguages.\nThe pipeline is based on IFCL, an intermediate firewall language\nequipped with a formal semantics, and it is implemented in an open\nsource tool called FWS. In particular, the first stage decompiles real\nfirewall configurations for iptables, ipfw, pf and (a subset of) Cisco\nIOS into IFCL. The second one transforms an IFCL configuration into a\nlogical predicate and uses the Z3 solver to synthesize an abstract\nspecification that succinctly represents the firewall behavior. System\nadministrators can use FWS to analyze the firewall by posing SQL-like\nqueries, and update the configuration to meet the desired security\nrequirements. Finally, the last stage allows for maintaining a\nconfiguration by acting directly on its abstract specification and then\ncompiling it to the chosen target language. Tests on real firewall\nconfigurations show that FWS can be fruitfully used in real-world\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Popularity and openness have made the Android platform a potential\ntarget of malware attacks. The hackers continuously evolve and improve\nattacking strategies to identify vulnerabilities in newer Android\nversions. Detection and analysis of malware attacks in Android platform\npose unique challenges due to the security restrictions and resource\nlimitations present in these devices. This paper proposes a new\nbehavioural method for Android malware detection and classification. In\nthe proposed approach, the Android malware dataset is decompiled to\nidentify the suspicious API classes/methods and generated an encoded\nlist. The multiple sequence alignment for different malware families is\ncreated using the encoded patterns and it is further applied to generate\nprofile hidden Markov model. The model classifies an unknown application\nas benign or malicious based on the log likelihood score generated. The\nframework provides an accuracy of 94.5\\%, which is relatively higher\ncompared to existing similar frameworks for detection of android\nmalware. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "As mobile phone is widely used in social network communication, it\nattracts numerous malicious attacks, which seriously threaten users'\npersonal privacy and data security. To improve the resilience to attack\ntechnologies, structural information analysis has been widely applied in\nmobile malware detection. However, the rapid improvement of mobile\napplications has brought an impressive growth of their internal\nstructure in scale and attack technologies. It makes the timely analysis\nof structural information and malicious feature generation a heavy\nburden. In this paper, we propose a new Android malware identification\napproach based on malicious subgraph mining to improve the detection\nperformance of large-scale graph structure analysis. Firstly, function\ncall graphs (FCGs), sensitive permissions, and application programming\ninterfaces (APIs) are generated from the decompiled files of malware.\nSecondly, two kinds of malicious subgraphs are generated from malware's\ndecompiled files and put into the feature set. At last, test\napplications' safety can be automatically identified and classified into\nmalware families by matching their FCGs with malicious structural\nfeatures. To evaluate our approach, a dataset of 11,520 malware and\nbenign applications is established. Experimental results indicate that\nour approach has better performance than three previous works and\nAndroguard.",

    "abstract": "The malicious APK (Android Application Package) makers use some\ntechniques such as code obfuscation and code encryption to avoid\nexisting detection methods, which poses new challenges for accurate\nvirus detection and makes it more and more difficult to detect the\nmalicious code. A report indicates that a new malicious app for Android\nis created every 10 seconds. To combat this serious malware activity, a\nscalable malware detection approach is needed, which can effectively and\nefficiently identify the malware apps. Common static detection methods\noften rely on Hash matching and analysis of viruses, which cannot\nquickly detect new malicious Android applications and their variants. In\nthis paper, a malicious Android application detection method is\nproposed, which is implemented by the deep network fusion model. The\nhybrid model only needs to use the sample training model to achieve high\naccuracy in the identification of the malicious applications, which is\nmore suitable for the detection of the new malicious Android\napplications than the existing methods. This method extracts the static\nfeatures in the core code of the Android application by decompiling APK\nfiles, then performs code vectorization processing, and uses the deep\nlearning network for classification and discrimination. Our experiments\nwith a data set containing 10,170 apps show that the decisions from the\nhybrid model can increase the malware detection rate significantly on a\nreal device, which verifies the superiority of this method in the\ndetection of malicious codes.",

    "abstract": "Owing to the development of next-generation network and data processing\ntechnologies, massive Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming\nhyperconnected. As a result, Linux malware is being created to attack\nsuch hyperconnected networks by exploiting security threats in IoT\ndevices. To determine the potential threats of such Linux malware and\nrespond effectively, malware classification through an analysis of the\nexecuted code is required; however, a limitation exists in that each\nheterogeneous architecture must be analyzed separately. However, the\nbinary codes of a heterogeneous architecture can be translated to a\nhigh-level intermediate representation (IR) of the same format using\nbinary lifting and malicious behavior information can be identified\nbecause the functions and parameters of the assembly code are stored in\nthe IR. Consequently, this study suggests a Linux malware classification\nmethod applicable to various architectures by converting Linux assembly\ncodes into an IR using binary lifting and then learning the IR Sequence\nwhich reflects malicious behavior pattern using deep learning model for\nsequence learning.",

    "abstract": "More and more Android application developers are adopting many different\nmethods against reverse engineering, such as adding a shell, resulting\nin certain features that cannot be obtained through decompilation, which\ncauses a serious sample imbalance in Android malware detection based on\nmachine learning. Hence, the researchers have focused on how to solve\nclass-imbalance to improve the performance of Android malware detection.\nHowever, the disadvantages of the existing class-imbalance learning are\nmainly the loss of valuable samples and the computational cost. In this\npaper, we propose a method of Class-Imbalance Learning (CIL), which\nfirst selects representative features, uses the clustering K-Means\nalgorithm and under-sampling to retain the important samples of the\nmajority class while reducing the number of samples of the majority\nclass. After that, we use the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique\n(SMOTE) algorithm to generate minority class samples for data balance,\nand finally use the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to build a malware\ndetection model. The result of experiments indicates that CIL\neffectively improves the performance of Android malware detection based\non machine learning, especially for class imbalance. Compared with\nexisting class-imbalance learning methods, CIL is also effective for the\nMachine Learning Repository from the University of California, Irvine\n(UCI) and has better performance in some data sets.",

    "abstract": "Many internet artworks from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s used Adobe\nFlash technology for creating animated content. However, in the light of\nrecent web standard developments (HTML5), Adobe has stopped supporting\nFlash and its related tools. The removal of Flash has made those net\nartworks non-functional and unviewable, including Sinae Kim's Genesis\n(2001), the focus of this study. Recently proposed emulation- and\nvirtualisation-based strategies are not always suitable, particularly if\nthere is a desire to keep the artwork on the `live web'. This article\noutlines an alternative method of migration facilitated by reverse\nengineering techniques-specifically decompilation-and foregrounds the\nsignificance of maintaining online access to the obsolete Adobe\nShockwave Flash (SWF) files through the source code. On this premise,\nthe source code is re-imagined as a site for further re-enactment,\nallowing a departure from its current role as a marker of\n`authenticity'.",

    "abstract": "Cyberattacks are increasing in both number and severity for private,\ncorporate, and governmental bodies. To prevent these attacks, many\nintrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems provide\ncomputer security by monitoring network packets and auditing system\nrecords. However, most of these systems only monitor network packets\nrather than the computer itself, so physical intrusion is also an\nimportant security issue. Furthermore, with the rapid progress of the\nInternet of Things (IoT) technology, security problems of IoT devices\nare also increasing. Many IoT devices can be disassembled for\ndecompilation, resulting in the theft of sensitive data. To prevent\nthis, physical intrusion detection systems of the IoT should be\nconsidered. We here propose a physical security system that can protect\ndata from unauthorized access when the computer chassis is opened or\ntampered with. Sensor switches monitor the chassis status at all times\nand upload event logs to a cloud server for remote monitoring. If the\nsystem finds that the computer has an abnormal condition, it takes\nprotective measures and notifies the administrator. This system can be\nextended to IoT devices to protect their data from theft.",

    "abstract": "Software piracy is an act of illegal stealing and distributing\ncommercial software either for revenue or identify theft. Pirated\napplications on Android app stores are harming developers and their\nusers by clone scammers. The scammers usually generate pirated versions\nof the same applications and publish them in different open-source app\nstores. There is no centralized system between these app stores to\nprevent scammers from publishing pirated applications. As most of the\napp stores are hosted on cloud storage, therefore a cloud-based\ninteraction system can prevent scammers from publishing pirated\napplications. In this paper, we proposed IoT-based cloud architecture\nfor clone detection using program dependency analysis. First, the newly\nsubmitted APK and possible original files are selected from app stores.\nThe APK Extractor and JDEX decompiler extract APK and DEX files for Java\nsource code analysis. The dependency graphs of Java files are generated\nto extract a set of weighted features. The Stacked-Long Short-Term\nMemory (S-LSTM) deep learning model is designed to predict possible\nclones.\nExperimental results have shown that the proposed approach can achieve\nan average accuracy of 95.48\\% among clones from different application\nstores.",

    "abstract": "Mobile malware is malicious software designed specifically for targeting\nvarious mobile gadgets like tablets, smartphones, and so forth, in which\nany type of malicious code affecting the mobile devices without the\nknowledge of the user. The increasing number of users encourages the\nhacker for generating various malware applications. Therefore, in this\npaper, we utilized three vital phases namely the pre-processing process,\nFeature extraction process as well as classification process in which\nthe malicious data are detected. In the pre-processing phase, an\nAndroguard tool is used for decompiling and disassembling the android\napplications. The API call features are extracted in the feature\nextraction phase and in the classification phase, long short term memory\nbased electro search optimization (LSTM-ESO) is employed to detect the\nunknown mobile applications as benign or malicious. The malicious mobile\ndetecting accuracy deals in requesting permission and exhibiting\nmalicious code applications. In order to enhance the identification of\nvarious malware applications, this paper utilized frequency analysis and\npermissions of API calls. Finally, the experimental analysis is\nperformed by evaluating the performance measures like accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F-measure. From the evaluation outcome, it is\nobserved that the classification accuracy obtained is 97.69\\%.",

    "abstract": "Malware detection is of great significance for maintaining the security\nof information systems. Malware obfuscation techniques and malware\nvariants are increasingly emerging, but their samples and API\n(application programming interface) sequences are difficult to obtain.\nThis poses difficulties for the development of malware variant detection\nmodels. To address this issue in this paper, we first generated a\nmalware variant dataset using the obfuscation technique based on the\ndisassembly and decompilation of malware. Then, an API call dataset of\nthese malware variants was constructed through sandboxing. Compared to\nsimilar work, the malware variants and their obfuscated API call\nsequences generated in this paper were all runnable. After that, taking\na public API call sequence dataset of obfuscation-free malware as input,\na BERT (bidirectional encoder representation from transformers)\npretrained model for malware detection was constructed. To enhance the\nability of this pretrained model to handle obfuscation and variants, in\nthis paper, we used adversarial training to improve the robustness and\ngeneralization of the detection model under obfuscation. As the\nexperimental results show, the proposed scheme can improve the\nclassification performance of malware variants under obfuscation. The\naccuracy of the malware variant classification was close to that of the\nunobfuscated case.",

    "abstract": "Due to the open-source and versatility of the Android operating system,\nAndroid malware has exploded, and the malware detection of Android IoT\ndevices has become a research hotspot in recent years. Static analysis\ntechnology cannot effectively analyze obfuscated malware. Without\ndecomposing, the existing detection methods are mainly based on\ngrayscale images and single files without analyzing and verifying their\nanti-obfuscation performance. In addition, the current detection of\nAndroid malware using deep learning is concentrated in the field of\nbinary classification. This paper proposes a multi-classification method\nof the Android malware family based on multi-class feature files and RGB\nimages to solve these problems. The method proposed in this paper does\nnot need to decompile the Android APK installation package. However, it\nextracts the DEX file and XML file in batch from the APK installation\npackage. Then, it converts the file into an RGB image using the\nconversion algorithm that converts Android software into images.\nFinally, the deep neural network automatically obtains the RGB image\ntexture features to realize the multiple classifications of the Android\nmalware family. Experimental data show that the proposed method has high\ndetection performance, and the accuracy of multiple classifications of\nthe Android malware family is as high as 99.84\\%. In addition, the\nmethod based on RGB image is better than the gray-scale image in\ndetection accuracy, and the effect of RGB image combined with DEX and\nXML is better than that of separate DEX file image and separate XML file\nimage. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper can effectively\ndetect the obfuscated Android malware, and the detection accuracy of\n99.23\\% can be achieved for the obfuscated sample data. Furthermore,\nthis method has good anti-obfuscation ability. The proposed method is\ncompared with those based on Multi-Layer Perceptron, Long Short-Term\nMemory, bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Deep Belief Network.\nThe experimental results show the proposed method's effectiveness and\nhigh generalization performance.",

    "abstract": "The arrival of the Bourbons to the Hispanic Monarchy brought with it new\nways of conceiving of the society attached to its body politic. New laws\nand rights were promoted, which motivated among the free population a\nrecognition of their status and states in the space of the localities of\nHispanic America. In this sense, the present work attempts to approach\nthe case of the integration and recognition of the free population of\nthe city of Caloto, And the contiguous seat of Quilichao. The analysis\nof the census carried out in the year 1784 in Caloto and of the\ndecompiled documentation of the General Archive of the Nation, from the\ncolony section (Cauca populations) allows the observation and\nidentification that in the framework of the interwoven relationships of\nthe free or mestizo population there were some activities that\ninfluenced incorporation and the forms of participation in the\ncommunity.",

    "abstract": "Centrally controlled energy conversion schemes in intelligent\nresidential microgrids are a difficult optimization challenge because of\ntheir range of processing and power devices accessible. Typical steps to\nshrink the weight and seriousness of the issues are decreasing modelling\nprecision, adding several weights, or adjusting the measurement\naccuracy. Nevertheless, because these interventions modify the\nspecialization issue and thus result in various approaches as expected,\nthis article introduces a Bigdata assisted energy conversion model\n(BD-ECM) and evaluates a decomposition approach to solve the initial\nproblem recursively. Compared to the initial compact version, the\ndecayed approach is tested to demonstrate that all versions differ less\nthan 18.8\\%. Moreover, both methods contribute to the use of roughly\nsimilar structures. The results reveal that because of the existing\nconstraints on computational capital and simulation techniques,\ncondensed development of the common law can only be extended to moderate\nand limited intelligent grids. However, decentralized approaches can be\ndealing with sizeable dispersed generation structures. To assess the\nmonth's environmental and strategic advantages as part of the system,\nresearchers extend the decompiled approach to a massive smart grid. The\ndata reveal that prices can be lowered by 14.0\\% in local energy\nexchanges and pollution by 23.9\\% in the situation studied.",

    "abstract": "Malware detection is an important task in software maintenance. It can\neffectively protect user information from the attack of malicious\ndevelopers. Existing studies mainly focus on leveraging permission\ninformation and API call information to identify malware. However, many\nstudies pay attention to the API call without considering the role of\nAPI call sequences. In this study, we propose a new method by combining\nboth the permission information and the API call sequence information to\ndistinguish malicious applications from benign applications. First, we\nextract features of permission and API call sequence with a decompiling\ntool. Then, one-hot encoding and Word2Vec are adopted to represent the\npermission feature and the API call sequence feature for each\napplication, respectively. Based on this, we leverage Random Forest (RF)\nand Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a permission-based\nclassifier and an API call sequence-based classifier, respectively.\nFinally, we design a linear strategy to combine the outputs of these two\nclassifiers to predict the labels of newly arrived applications. By an\nevaluation with 15,198 malicious applications and 15,129 benign\napplications, our approach achieves 98.84\\% in terms of precision,\n98.17\\% in terms of recall, 98.50\\% in terms of F1-score, and 98.52\\% in\nterms of accuracy on average, and outperforms the state-of-art method\nMalscan by 2.12\\%, 0.27\\%, 1.20\\%, and 1.24\\%, respectively. In\naddition, we demonstrate that the method combining two features achieves\nbetter performance than the methods based on a single feature.",

    "abstract": "Static detection of security vulnerabilities in binary programs is an\nimportant research field in software supply chain security. However,\nexisting vulnerability detection methods based on code similarity can\nonly detect known vulnerabilities. Vulnerability features generated by\nvulnerability pattern-based detec-tion methods are low robust due to the\ninfluence of manually defined patterns, compiler diversity, and\nirrelevant function instructions. In this paper, we propose BinVulDet,\nwhich is a binary level vulnerability detection tool for accurate known\nand unknown vulnerability detection. BinVulDet uses decompilation\ntechniques to obtain pseudo code containing high-level semantic\ninformation against the impact of com-pilation diversity. Then the\nprogram slicing technique is used to extract the statements with data\ndepen-dencies and control dependencies related to the vulnerability. A\nBiLSTM-attention neural network is used to extract rich contextual\nsemantic information from slice codes to generate more robust\nvulnerability patterns to detect vulnerabilities. The experimental\nresults show that BinVulDet outperforms the state-of-the-art binary\nvulnerability detection methods. The FPR and FNR of BinVulDet are 1.04\\%\nand 0.89\\% on average, respectively, which are 3.93\\% and 22.86\\% lower\nthan the baseline model on average. BinVulDet can effectively against\nthe influence of compilation diversity and successfully be used for\nreal-world vul-nerability detection by being evaluated in three CVE\nvulnerability projects.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

    "abstract": "Decompilers are indispensable tools in Android malware analysis and app\nsecurity auditing. Numerous academic works also employ an Android\ndecompiler as the first step in a program analysis pipeline. In such\nsettings, decompilation is frequently regarded as a ``solved{''}\nproblem, in that it is simply expected that source code can be\naccurately recovered from an app. On the other hand, it is known that,\ne.g, obfuscation can negatively impact a decompiler's effectiveness.\nTherefore, in order to better understand potential failure modes of,\ne.g., automated analysis pipelines involving decompilation, it is\nimportant to characterize the performance of decompilers on both benign\nand malicious apps. To this end, we have performed what is, to the best\nof our knowledge, the first large-scale study of Android decompilation\nfailure rates, using three sets of apps; namely, 3,018 open-source apps,\n13,601 apps crawled from Google Play, and an existing collection of\n24,553 malware samples. In addition to the state-of-the-art Dalvik\nbytecode decompiler Jadx, we also studied the performance of three\npopular Java decompilers. Furthermore, this paper also presents the\nfindings from a follow-up study on 54,945 malware apps, where we\nadditionally performed an analysis of the reasons for decompilation\nfailures. Our study revealed that decompilers generally have very low\nfailure rates, and that few failures on benign apps appear to be related\nto obfuscation. On malware, however, obfuscation appears to be a more\nprominent cause of failures, although the vast majority of malicious\napps could still be fully decompiled by an ensemble of decompilers.",

    "abstract": "Android is now one of the most popular operating systems in the world\nbecause of its open source character, so the threshold for hackers to\nmake malware has also become lower, and more and more malware has\nstarted to threaten people's lives. Graphs are used to represent the\nprogram's syntactic and semantic structure, and can naturally represent\nmalicious behavior, so we propose a malware detection method named\nSFCGDroid, which based on sensitive function call graph, so we propose a\nmalware detection method named SFCGDroid, which based on sensitive\nfunction call graph. We first decompile the Android application to\ngenerate a function call graph (FCG), and extract the sensitive function\ncall graph (SFCG) on the FCG. Secondly, we extract two class features\n(1) use the Skip-gram model to obtain function embeddings, and (2) treat\nthe SFCG as a social network and extract the triads attribute of the\nsensitive API. The two types of features are combined as a feature\nrepresentation of the SFCG and fed into a graph convolutional network\n(GCN) for malware detection. For experiments on 26,939 Android software\ndatasets, SFCGDroid in this paper can achieve 98.22\\% accuracy and\n98.20\\% F1 score.",

    "abstract": "Smart contracts have been widely used in the blockchain world these\nyears, and simultaneously vulner-ability detection has gained more and\nmore attention due to the staggering economic losses caused by the\nattacker. Existing tools that analyze vulnerabilities for smart\ncontracts heavily rely on rules predefined by experts, which are\nlabour-intense and require domain knowledge. Moreover, predefined rules\ntend to be misconceptions and increase the risk of crafty potential\nback-doors in the future. Recently, researchers mainly used static and\ndynamic execution analysis to detect the vulnerabilities of smart\ncontracts and have achieved acceptable results. However, the dynamic\nmethod cannot cover all the program inputs and execution paths, which\nleads to some vulnerabilities that are hard to detect. The static\nanalysis method commonly includes symbolic execution and theorem\nproving, which requires using constraints to detect vulnerability. These\nshortcomings show that traditional methods are challenging to apply and\nexpand on a large scale. This paper aims to detect vulnerabilities via\nthe Bug Injection framework and transfer learning techniques. First, we\ntrain a Transformer encoder using multi-modality code, which contains\nsource code, intermediate representation, and assembly code. The input\ncode consists separately of Solidity source code, intermediate\nrepresentation, and assembly code. Specifically, we translate source\ncode into the intermediate representation and decompile the byte code\ninto assembly code by the EVM compiler. Then, we propose a novel entropy\nembedding technique, which combines token embedding, segment embedding,\nand positional embedding of the Transformer encoder in our approach.\nAfter that, we utilize the Bug Injection framework to automatically\ngenerate specific types of buggy code for fine-tuning and evaluating the\nperformance of vulnerability detection. The experimental results show\nthat our proposed approach improves the performance in detecting\nreentrancy vulnerabilities and timestamp dependence. Moreover, our\napproach is more flexible and scalable than static and dynamic analysis\napproaches in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. Our approach\nimproves the baseline approaches by an average of 11.89\\% in term of F1\nscore.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a systematic analysis of existing resource\nplatforms, evaluating their advantages and drawbacks with respect to\ndata privacy protection. To address the privacy and security risks\nassociated with resource platform data, we propose a novel privacy\nprotection algorithm based on chunking disorder. Our algorithm exchanges\ndata within a specific range of chunk size for the position and combines\nthe chunked data with the MD5 value in a differential way, thus ensuring\ndata privacy. To ensure the security of the algorithm, we also discuss\nthe importance of preventing client and server decompilation during its\nimplementation. The findings of our experiments are as follows. Our\nproposed privacy-preserving algorithm is extremely secure and easy to\nimplement. Our algorithm has a significant avalanche effect, maintaining\nvalues of 0.61-0.85, with information entropy being maintained at\n4.5-4.9. This indicates that our algorithm is highly efficient without\ncompromising data security. Furthermore, our algorithm has strong\nencryption and decryption time stability. The key length can be up to\n594 bits, rendering it challenging to decrypt. Compared with the\ntraditional DES algorithm, our algorithm has better security under the\nsame conditions and approaches the levels of security offered by the AES\nand RC4 algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The massive number of open-source projects in public repositories has\nnotably increased in the last years. Such repositories represent\nvaluable information to be mined for different purposes, such as\ndocumenting recurrent syntactic constructs, analyzing the particular\nconstructs used by experts and beginners, using them to teach\nprogramming and to detect bad programming practices, and building\nprogramming tools such as decompilers, Integrated Development\nEnvironments or Intelligent Tutoring Systems. An inherent problem of\nsource code is that its syntactic information is represented with tree\nstructures, while traditional machine learning algorithms use\nn-dimensional datasets. Therefore, we present a feature engineering\nprocess to translate tree structures into homogeneous and heterogeneous\nn-dimensional datasets to be mined. Then, we run different interpretable\n(supervised and unsupervised) machine learning algorithms to mine the\nsyntactic information of more than 17 million syntactic constructs in\nJava code. The results reveal interesting information such as the Java\nconstructs that are barely (and widely) used (e.g., bitwise operators,\nunion types and static blocks), different language features and patterns\nmostly (and barely) used by beginners (and experts), the discovery of\nparticular types of source code (e.g., helper or utility classes, data\ntransfer objects and too complex abstractions), and how complexity is an\ninherent characteristic in some clusters of syntactic constructs.",

    "abstract": "The smartphone has become an indispensable tool in our daily lives, and\nthe Android operating system is widely installed on our smartphones.\nThis makes Android smartphones a prime target for malware. In order to\naddress threats posed by malware, many researchers have proposed\ndifferent malware detection approaches, including using a function call\ngraph (FCG). Although an FCG can capture the complete call-callee\nsemantic relationship of a function, it will be represented as a huge\ngraph structure. The presence of many nonsensical nodes affects the\ndetection efficiency. At the same time, the characteristics of the graph\nneural networks (GNNs) make the important node features in the FCG tend\ntoward similar nonsensical node features during the propagation process.\nIn our work, we propose an Android malware detection approach to enhance\nnode feature differences in an FCG. Firstly, we propose an API-based\nnode feature by which we can visually analyze the behavioral properties\nof different functions in the app and determine whether their behavior\nis benign or malicious. Then, we extract the FCG and the features of\neach function from the decompiled APK file. Next, we calculate the API\ncoefficient inspired by the idea of the TF-IDF algorithm and extract the\nsensitive function called subgraph (S-FCSG) based on API coefficient\nranking. Finally, before feeding the S-FCSG and node features into the\nGCN model, we add the self-loop for each node of the S-FCSG. A 1-D\nconvolutional neural network and fully connected layers are used for\nfurther feature extraction and classification, respectively. The\nexperimental result shows that our approach enhances the node feature\ndifferences in an FCG, and the detection accuracy is greater than that\nof models using other features, suggesting that malware detection based\non a graph structure and GNNs has a lot of space for future study.",

    "abstract": "Energy efficiency is a non-functional requirement that developers must\nconsider, particularly when building software for battery-operated\ndevices like mobile ones: a long-lasting battery is an essential\nrequirement for an enjoyable user experience.In previous studies, it has\nbeen shown that many mobile applications include inefficiencies that\ncause battery to be drained faster than necessary. Some of these\ninefficiencies result from software patterns that have been catalogued,\nand for which more energy-efficient alternatives are also known.The\nexisting catalogues, however, assume as a fundamental requirement that\none has access to the source code of an application in order to be able\nto analyse it. This requirement makes independent energy analysis\nchallenging, or even impossible, e.g. for a mobile user or, most\nsignificantly, an App Store trying to provide information on how\nefficient an application being submitted for publication is.We study the\nviability of looking for known energy patterns in applications by\ndecompiling them and analysing the resulting code. For this, we\ndecompiled and analysed 420 open-source applications by extending an\nexisting tool, which is now capable of transparently decompiling and\nanalysing android applications. With the collected data, we performed a\ncomparative study of the presence of four energy patterns between the\nsource code and the decompiled code.We performed two types of analysis:\n(i) comparing the total number of energy pattern detections; (ii)\ncomparing the similarity between energy pattern detections. When\ncomparing the total number of detections in source code against\ndecompiled code, we found that 79.29\\% of the applications reported the\nsame number of energy pattern detections.To test the similarity between\nsource code and APKs, we calculated, for each application, a similarity\nscore based on our four implemented detectors. Of all applications,\n35.76\\% achieved a perfect similarity score of 4, and 89.40\\% got a\nscore of 3 or more out of 4. Furthermore, only two applications got a\nscore of 0.When viewed in tandem, the results of the two analyses we\nperformed point in a promising direction. They provide initial evidence\nthat static analysis techniques, typically used in source code, can be a\nviable method to inspect APKs when access to source code is restricted,\nand further research in this area is worthwhile.",

    "abstract": "A novel program code obfuscation approach involving the x86 mode\nswitching is proposed in the paper. The details and existing\napplications of x86 mode switching are reviewed, as well as the possible\nconsequences of using this switching to the reverse engineering tools.\nBased on this approach, a few specific methods are proposed and\nevaluated against the most popular reverse engineering tools of various\npurposes, including disassemblers, decompilers, binary instrumentation\nand symbolic execution tools. A method of seamless integration of these\nmachine code level obfuscations to the C, C++ and possibly other\ncompilers is also proposed.",

In this paper, a new method\nfor Android malware classification is proposed. The method implements a\nconvolutional neural network for malware classification using images.\nThe research presents a novel approach to transforming the Android\nApplication Package (APK) into a grayscale image. The image creation\nutilizes natural language processing techniques for text cleaning,\nextraction, and fuzzy hashing to represent the decompiled code from the\nAPK in a set of hashes after preprocessing, where the image is composed\nof n fuzzy hashes that represent an APK. The method was tested on an\nAndroid malware dataset with 15,493 samples of five malware types. The\nproposed method showed an increase in accuracy compared to others in the\nliterature, achieving up to 98.24\\% in the classification task.",

    "abstract": "Food chemicals have a fundamental role in our lives, with an extended\nimpact on nutrition, disease prevention, and marked economic\nimplications in the food industry. The number of food chemical compounds\nin public databases has substantially increased in the past few years,\nwhich can be characterized using chemoinformatics approaches. We and\nother groups explored public food chemical libraries containing up to\n26,500 compounds. This study aimed to analyze the chemical contents,\ndiversity, and coverage in the chemical space of food chemicals and\nadditives and, from here on, food components. The approach to food\ncomponents addressed in this study is a public database with more than\n70,000 compounds, including those predicted via omics techniques. It was\nconcluded that food components have distinctive physicochemical\nproperties and constitutional descriptors despite sharing many chemical\nstructures with natural products. Food components, on average, have\nlarge molecular weights and several apolar structures with saturated\nhydrocarbons. Compared to reference databases, food component structures\nhave low scaffold and fingerprint-based diversity and high structural\ncomplexity, as measured by the fraction of sp3 carbons. These structural\nfeatures are associated with a large fraction of macronutrients as\nlipids. Lipids in food components were decompiled by an analysis of the\nmaximum common substructures. The chemical multiverse representation of\nfood chemicals showed a larger coverage of chemical space than natural\nproducts and FDA-approved drugs by using different sets of\nrepresentations.",

The method is based on the analysis of pseudocode\nobtained as a result of decompiling fragments of binary codes. The\nanalysis is performed using attributed abstract syntax trees (AASTs). As\npart of the study, testing and comparative analysis of the effectiveness\nof the developed method are carried out. This method makes it possible\nto increase the efficiency of detecting functionally similar fragments\nof program code, compared to analogs, by using the semantic context of\nvertices in abstract syntax trees.",

    "abstract": "Adequately selecting variable names is a difficult activity for\npractitioners. In 2018, Jaffe et al. proposed the use of statistical\nmachine translation (SMT) to suggest descriptive variable names for\ndecompiled code. A large corpus of decompiled C code was used to train\nthe SMT model. Our paper presents the results of a partial replication\nof Jaffe's experiment. We apply the same technique and methodology to a\ndataset made of code written in the Pharo programming language. We\nselected Pharo since its syntax is simple - it fits on half of a\npostcard - and because the optimizations performed by the compiler are\nlimited to method scope. Our results indicate that SMT may recover\nbetween 8.9\\% and 69.88\\% of the variable names depending on the\ntraining set. Our replication concludes that: (i) the accuracy depends\non the code similarity between the training and testing sets; (ii) the\nsimplicity of the Pharo syntax and the satisfactory decompiled code\nalignment have a positive impact on predicting variable names; and (iii)\na relatively small code corpus is sufficient to train the SMT model,\nwhich shows the applicability of the approach to less popular\nprogramming languages. Additionally, to assess SMT's potential in\nimproving original variable names, ten Pharo developers reviewed 400 SMT\nname suggestions, with four reviews per variable. Only 15 suggestions\n(3.75\\%) were unanimously viewed as improvements, while 45 (11.25\\%)\nwere perceived as improvements by at least two reviewers, highlighting\nSMT's limitations in providing suitable alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Future protocols in the digital society will be built on the foundation\nof smart contracts, which are code and algorithmic contracts. Smart\ncontracts enable all phases of the contracting process without the need\nfor outside parties by using protocols and user interfaces. But as\nblockchain technology has quickly advanced, many security flaws in smart\ncontracts have also come to light. This article offers a thorough\nexamination and organized summary of the pertinent material of smart\ncontract security analysis. These sections make up the bulk of our\nsurvey's contributions. First, a brief history of Ethereum is provided,\nfollowed by a proposal of the security difficulties now faced by\nblockchain smart contracts, with a focus on the analysis and\nclassification of various security flaws. Second, based on a thorough\nexamination of these studies, we present a summary of various smart\ncontract security options, including case studies and detailed\ndescriptions of the state-of-the-art in terms of automatic auditing,\nsubject matter experts, scalable smart contracts, smart contract\ntemplates, decompilers, semantic frameworks, and anomaly detection.\nFinally, we go over each sort of solution's advantages and disadvantages\nand outline potential future research trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Ransomware is one of the most extended cyberattacks. It consists of\nencrypting a user's files or locking the smartphone in order to\nblackmail a victim. The attacking software is ordered on the infected\ndevice from the attacker's remote server, known as command and control.\nIn this work, we propose a method to recover from a Locker.CB!tr\nransomware attack after it has infected and hit a smartphone. The\nnovelty of our approach lies on exploiting the communication between the\nransomware on the infected device and the attacker's command and control\nserver as a point to reverse disruptive actions like screen locking or\nfile encryption. For this purpose, we carried out both a dynamic and a\nstatic analysis of decompiled Locker.CB!tr ransomware source code to\nunderstand its operation principles and exploited communication patterns\nfrom the IP layer to the application layer to fully impersonate the\ncommand and control server. This way, we gained full control over the\nLocker.CB!tr ransomware instance. From that moment, we were able to\ncommand the Locker.CB!tr ransomware instance on the infected device to\nunlock the smartphone or decrypt the files. The contributions of this\nwork are a novel method to recover the mobile phone after ransomware\nattack based on the analysis of the ransomware communication with the\nC\\&C server; and a mechanism for impersonating the ransomware C\\&C\nserver and thus gaining full control over the ransomware instance.",

The detection, classification, and analysis of\nLinux IoT malware and its variants present significant challenges due to\nthe wide range of architectures supported by the Linux IoT platform.\nThis study concentrates on static analysis using binary lifting\ntechniques to extract and analyze Intermediate Representation (IR)\nopcode sequences. We introduce a set of statistical entropy-based\nfeatures derived from these IR opcode sequences, establishing a\npractical and straightforward methodology for machine learning\nclassification models. By exclusively analyzing function metadata and\nopcode entropy, our architecture-agnostic approach not only efficiently\ndetects malware but also classifies its variants with a high degree of\naccuracy, achieving an F1 score of 97\\%. The proposed approach offers a\nrobust alternative for enhancing malware detection and variant\nidentification frameworks for IoT devices.",

    "abstract": "Android malware uses anti-reverse analysis and APK shelling technology,\nwhich leads to the failure of the classification method based on\ndecompiled features and the reduction of the classification accuracy\nbased on single file features. Moreover, the lack of samples in some\nfamilies of Android malware makes the classification model based on\nsample learning ineffective. To solve the above problems, this paper\nproposes a two-layer general framework for Android malware\nclassification and adversarial training named GMADV, which enhances\nclassifier performance through adversarial training. In the sample\nclassification layer, based on the transformation method of the Markov\nmodel, it is proposed for the first time to convert the three files in\nthe APK into RGB Markov images, and use VGG13 to automatically extract\nfeatures and classification; In the variant amplification layer, the\nidea of ``regression for generation{''} is firstly proposed, and GMM-GAN\nbased on Gaussian process is designed to amplify the diversity of\nsamples within the family. The experimental results show that RGB Markov\nimages have better classification performance than grayscale images. On\nthe three datasets, the classification effect after amplification has\nbeen improved to varying degrees, and all F1\\_Score reaches 95 \\%.\nCompared with other methods, GMADV has stronger family sample\namplification ability and greater adversarial intensity.",

    "abstract": "Static taint analysis is a widely used method to identify\nvulnerabilities in Android applications. However, the existing tools for\nstatic analysis often struggle with processing times, particularly when\ndealing with complex real-world programs. To reduce time consumption,\nsome tools choose to sacrifice analytical precision, e.g., FastDroid\nsets an upper limit for analysis iterations in Android applications. In\nthis paper, we propose a labeled taint value graph (LTVG) to store taint\nflows, and implement a fine-grained analysis tool called LabeledDroid.\nThis graph is constructed based on the taint value graph (TVG) of\nFastDroid, and takes into account both precision and time consumption.\nThat is, we decompile an Android app into Jimple statements, develop\nfinegrained propagation rules to handle List, and construct LTVGs\naccording to these rules. Afterwards, we traverse LTVGs to obtain\nhigh-precision taint flows. An analysis of 39 apps from the TaintBench\nbenchmark shows that LabeledDroid is 0.87 s faster than FastDroid on\naverage. Furthermore, if some common accuracy parameters are adapted in\nboth LabeledDroid and FastDroid, the experiment demonstrates that the\nformer is more scalable. Moreover, the maximum analysis time of\nLabeledDroid is less than 200 s and its average time is 46.25 s, while\nFastDroid sometimes experiences timeouts with durations longer than 600\ns. Additionally, LabeledDroid achieves a precision of 70\\% in handling\nlists, while FastDroid and TaintSA achieve precisions of 38.9\\% and\n41.2\\%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "One of the tasks of security analysts is to detect security\nvulnerabilities and ongoing attacks. There is already a large number of\nsoftware tools that can help to collect security-relevant data, such as\nevent logs, security settings, application manifests, and even the\n(decompiled) source code of potentially malicious applications. The\nanalyst must study these data, evaluate them, and properly identify and\nclassify suspicious activities and applications. Fast advances in the\narea of Artificial Intelligence have produced large language models that\ncan perform a variety of tasks, including generating text summaries and\nreports. In this article, we study the potential black-box use of LLM\nchatbots as a support tool for security analysts. We provide two case\nstudies: the first is concerned with the identification of\nvulnerabilities in Android applications, and the second one is concerned\nwith the analysis of security logs. We show how LLM chatbots can help\nsecurity analysts in their work, but point out specific limitations and\nsecurity concerns related to this approach.",

    "abstract": "FPGA bitstream is a binary file containing chip configuration\ninformation. It is often compressed to conserve storage space and reduce\nconfiguration time. However, if the bitstream file is compressed,\nhardware attacks cannot be detected because FPGA reverse-engineering\ntools can only decompile uncompressed and unencrypted bitstream. This\nstudy proposes a low complexity decompression method for commercial FPGA\nbitstreams, which is a crucial step for assessing the security of FPGAs.\nBy comparing the structure of compressed and uncompressed bitstream\nfiles, we identify the compression region, extract the compressed data,\nand construct a database for the mapping information. Then, we introduce\na decoding algorithm that utilizes a sliding window approach based on\nthe characteristics of the compressed data and implement the algorithm\non an Intel Cyclone V FPGA. Finally, the proposed framework is validated\non 24 different types of Intel FPGAs from 6 families, with a perfect\naccuracy rate of 100\\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\npaper to disclose a decompression method for commercial FPGAs.",

    "abstract": "Code similarity detection identifies code by analyzing similarities in\nsyntax, semantics, and structure, which includes types of tasks:\nsource-to-source, binary-to-binary, and source-to-binary. Due to\nencoding and representation disparities between source and binary code,\nexisting methods have mainly focused on individual tasks, without\nproviding a universal solution. Additionally, current source-to-binary\ntasks only achieve one-to-one matching between source code and binary\nfunctions, neglecting the one-to-many relationship inherent between\nsource code and its cross-compiled binaries. In this paper, we propose\nCrossCode2Vec, a unified framework for representing code in both source\nand binary functions, which aims to bridge the gap in original coding\nfeatures and provide a standardized similarity measurement across three\ncode similarity detection tasks. For source code and its corresponding\ncompiled binary, we first design an enhanced Abstract Path Context data\npreprocessing method, construct an abstract syntax tree (AST) from both\nsource code functions and decompiled binary functions, and implement the\nfunction embedding followed by the pre-trained Word2vec model. Then we\npropose a task-specific data sampling strategy. We establish a\none-to-one correspondence between source and binary functions through\nsymbol tables and create a one-to-many relationship between source\nfunctions and their cross-compiled binaries based on sampling rules.\nFinally, we employ a hierarchical LSTM-attention network to facilitate\nthe representation and similarity measurement of functions. We conduct\nboth extrinsic and intrinsic evaluations to confirm the effectiveness of\nCrossCode2Vec in code representation and code similarity tasks,\nvalidating its superiority in model architecture and data processing\nmethods. CrossCode2Vec demonstrates stable and exceptional performance\nacross multiple experiments, reinforcing its ability to bridge the gap\nbetween source and binary code representations while effectively\nmeasuring their similarities.",

    "abstract": "The .NET framework is widely used for software development, making it a\ntarget for a significant number of malware attacks by developing\nmalicious executables. Previous studies on malware detection often\nrelied on developing generic detection methods for Windows malware that\nwere not tailored to the unique characteristics of .NET executables. As\na result, there remains a significant knowledge gap regarding the\ndevelopment of effective detection methods tailored to .NET malware.\nThis work introduces a novel framework for detecting malicious .NET\nexecutables using statically extracted method names. To address the lack\nof datasets focused exclusively on .NET malware, a new dataset\nconsisting of both malicious and benign .NET executable features was\ncreated. Our approach involves decompiling .NET executables, parsing the\nresulting code, and extracting standard .NET method names. Subsequently,\nfeature selection techniques were applied to filter out less relevant\nmethod names. The performance of six machine learning models-XGBoost,\nrandom forest, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM),\nlogistic regression, and na \\& iuml;ve Bayes-was compared. The results\nindicate that XGBoost outperforms the other models, achieving an\naccuracy of 96.16\\% and an F1-score of 96.15\\%. The experimental results\nshow that standard .NET method names are reliable features for detecting\n.NET malware.",

    "abstract": "Purpose- The openness of the Android operating system offers users\nconvenience but also exposes them to a multitude of malicious\napplications. Consequently, analyzing applications before installation\nhas become a crucial research area in mobile security. Static analysis,\nknown for its accuracy and low cost, is a prominent method within this\nfield. This paper aims to propose an ML/DL-based approach to detect\nbenign and malicious applications in APK format.\nDesign/methodology/approach- The analysis method, detailed further in\nthe paper, consists of five steps. Step 1, each APK file in the sample\nset undergoes decompilation to convert it into source code. Then,\ndirected API call graph (DACG) generator is used to analyze the\ndecompiled source code from Step 1 and extract API calls. After that,\nthe authors apply the graph2vec method to convert the DACG data set into\ncharacteristic subgraphs. Next, saving the necessary features that each\nmodel needs to learn from the vector set. This helps reduce the vector\ndimensionality for each model type and reduces time and noise by\neliminating unnecessary features. Finally, training and evaluating the\nability to detect Android malware based on popular machine learning\nalgorithms such as Random Forest, support vector machine, K-nearest\nneighbor, logistic regression and one of the most powerful machine\nlearning algorithms currently available, gradient boosting regression.\nFindings- The authors come to the conclusion, feature graphs based on\nAPI call graphs are effective in detecting Android malware. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over existing\ndetection methods on a data set of 7,000 samples, achieving TPR > 97\\%,\nFPR < 1\\% and AUC similar to 0.98. Following these steps, a final\nclassification will determine the safety of the tested application,\naiding users in avoiding malware installation. Research\nlimitations/implications- Although some limitations remain to be\naddressed, the DACG construction method holds significant potential for\nfurther exploration. Future research will focus on integrating dynamic\nanalysis techniques to broaden the detectable and classifiable Android\nmalware categories. In addition, the authors aim to adapt the\nmethodology for broader applicability to other system types, including\nthe widely used ELF systems in Linux. Originality/value- In the study,\nthe authors addressed the issue of generating graph-based feature for\nAndroid malware detection in a meaningful, practical and efficient way.\nThe results can be used as a pattern for similar scenarios and\napplications.",

    "abstract": "The development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought convenience\nto people's lives, but it also introduces significant security risks.\nDue to the limitations of IoT devices themselves and the challenges of\nre-hosting technology, existing fuzzing for IoT devices is mainly\nconducted through black-box methods, which lack effective execution\nfeedback and are blind. Meanwhile, the existing static methods mainly\nrely on taint analysis, which has high overhead and high false alarm\nrates. We propose a new directed fuzz testing method for detecting bugs\nin web service programs of IoT devices, which can test IoT devices more\nquickly and efficiently. Specifically, we identify external input entry\npoints using multiple features. Then we quickly find sensitive targets\nand paths affected by external input sources based on sensitive data\nflow analysis of decompiled code, treating them as testing objects.\nFinally, we perform a directed fuzzing test. We use debugging interfaces\nto collect execution feedback and guide the program to reach sensitive\ntargets based on program pruning techniques. We have implemented a\nprototype system, AntDFuzz, and evaluated it on firmware from ten\ndevices across five well-known manufacturers. We discovered twelve\npotential vulnerabilities, seven of which were confirmed and assigned\nbug id by China National Vulnerability Database (CNVD). The results show\nthat our approach has the ability to find unknown bugs in real devices\nand is more efficient compared to existing tools.",

    "abstract": "Recent approaches to binary-source code matching often operate at the\nintermediate representation (IR) level, with some applying the matching\nprocess at the binary level by compiling the source code to binary and\nthen matching it directly with the binary code. Others, though less\ncommon, perform matching at the decompiler-generated pseudo-code level\nby first decompiling the binary code into pseudo-code and then comparing\nit with the source code. However, all these approaches are limited by\nthe loss of semantic information in the original source code and the\nintroduction of noise during compilation and decompilation, making\naccurate matching challenging and often requiring specialized expertise.\nTo address these limitations, this study introduces a system for\nbinary-source code matching based on decompilation techniques and Graph\nanalysis (BSMDG) that matches binary code with source code at the source\ncode level. Our method utilizes the Ghidra decompiler in conjunction\nwith a custom-built transpiler to reconstruct highlevel C++ source code\nfrom binary executables. Subsequently, call graphs (CGs) and control\nflow graphs (CFGs) are generated for both the original and translated\ncode to evaluate their structural and semantic similarities. To evaluate\nour system, we used a curated dataset of C++ source code and\ncorresponding binary files collected from the AtCoder website for\ntraining and testing. Additionally, a case study was conducted using the\nwidely recognized POJ-104 benchmark dataset to assess the system's\ngeneralizability. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining\ndecompilation with graph-based analysis, with our system achieving 90\\%\naccuracy on POJ-104, highlighting its potential in code clone detection,\nvulnerability identification, and reverse engineering tasks.",

    "abstract": "Compilers play a crucial role in software development, as most software\nmust be compiled into binaries before release. Analyzing the compiler\nversion from binary files is of great importance in software reverse\nengineering, maintenance, traceability, and information security. In\nthis work, we propose a novel framework for compiler version\nidentification. Firstly, we generated 1000 C language source codes using\nCSmith and subsequently compiled them into 16,000 binary files using 16\ndistinct versions of compilers. The symmetric distribution of the\ndataset among different compiler versions may ensure unbiased model\ntraining. Then, IDA Pro was used to decompile the binary files into\nassembly instruction sequences. From these sequences, we extracted\nfrequency-based features via the Bag-of-Words (BOW) model and\nsequence-based features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix\n(GLCM). Finally, we introduced a divide-and-conquer framework\n(DIANA-SVM) to effectively classify compiler versions. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) models\nstruggle to accurately identify compiler versions using compiled\nexecutable files. In contrast, DIANA-SVM's symmetric data separation\napproach enhances performance, achieving an accuracy of 94\\% (+/-\n0.375\\%). This framework enables precise identification of high-risk\ncompiler versions, offering a reliable tool for software supply chain\nsecurity. Theoretically, our GLCM-based sequence modeling and\ndivide-and-conquer framework advance feature extraction methodologies\nfor binary files, offering a scalable solution for similar\nclassification tasks beyond compiler identification.",

    "abstract": "The architecture of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) has evolved into an\nintegrated cyber-physical system, introducing covert, zero-dynamic\ncyberattack vectors that threaten the reliability of ICS. We address two\nissues: (1) how to use decentralized solutions to defend\nresource-constrained ICS against highly covert zero-dynamic attacks; (2)\nhow to improve performance (meeting real-time, high-frequency\ninteraction demands) while enhancing reliability via decentralization.\nWe propose a defense model integrating blockchain, zero-knowledge\nproofs, and smart contract (SC) obfuscation to bolster ICS resilience. A\ncustomized zk-SNARK algorithm enables efficient identity authentication,\ncompleted in under 3 ms. The Garble framework obfuscates SCs, concealing\nICS device IP addresses and disrupting attack chains. A blockchain acts\nas a secure intermediary between the engineer workstation (EW) and\nprogrammable logic controller (PLC). To reduce blockchain overhead, we\nrefine a proportional-integral-derivative (PID)-based roulette wheel\nalgorithm. Obfuscated SCs resist decompilation by tools such as Objdump,\nensuring robust protection. Our node selection mechanism balances\nsecurity and diversity, mitigating systemic biases like the Matthew\neffect. By leveraging blockchain to supply computational power for\nencrypting and protecting ICS data flows, we offer new insights into\ndefending ICS against highly covert cyberattacks. Experimental\nevaluation validates the model's effectiveness under real-world ICS\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Reverse engineering complex proprietary software is a tedious and time\nconsuming task. A fair amount of the overall effort is usually devoted\nto locating those software components which are responsible for the\nfunctionality of interest (e.g., a proprietary encryption algorithm). To\naid this process, several tools, available in the public domain, can be\nused, implementing sophisticated algorithms for control-flow recovery,\nstack frame recovery, data type inference, decompilation etc. However,\nthe important problem of decomposing a binary executable to its\nconstituent object files (or compile-units) has not been, in our\nopinion, sufficiently studied. In this paper we present novel techniques\nfor estimating the number, as well as the boundaries, of compile-units\nin binary executables. We present algorithms which recover information\nthat improves the precision degree in reverse engineering tasks. In\naddition, our algorithms can be used to reduce the effort of locating,\nrecovering and understanding specific functionalities of closed-source\nsoftware. We evaluate our algorithms on the public DeepBinDiff ELF\ndataset, consisting of \\textbackslash{}documentclass{[}12pt]\\{minimal\\}\n\\textbackslash{}usepackage\\{amsmath\\}\n\\textbackslash{}usepackage\\{wasysym\\}\n\\textbackslash{}usepackage\\{amsfonts\\}\n\\textbackslash{}usepackage\\{amssymb\\}\n\\textbackslash{}usepackage\\{amsbsy\\}\n\\textbackslash{}usepackage\\{mathrsfs\\}\n\\textbackslash{}usepackage\\{upgreek\\}\n\\textbackslash{}setlength\\{\\textbackslash{}oddsidemargin\\}\\{-69pt\\}\n\\textbackslash{}begin\\{document\\}\\$\\$\\textbackslash{}approx\\$\\$\\textback\nslash{}end\\{document\\} 2000 binaries, as well as two larger executables\nof GNU GDB, built for ARM and AArch64 and show that they consistently\napproach the ground-truth, with an average recovery precision close to\n75\\%. Furthermore, we show how our research can aid in binary diffing\napplications, by comparing the recovered compile-unit structure of a\npair of Microsoft Windows kernel images. We make our prototype\nimplementation, written in Python and named REcover, publicly available\nfor further evaluation by the reverse engineering community.",

    "abstract": "Natural hierarchical porous materials, inspired by biological systems\nlike plant vascular networks, hold trans-formative potential for\nenergy-efficient and environmental applications. However, translating\nthese natural designs into engineered aerogels with precise multiscale\npore control and multifunctional performance remains a critical\nchallenge. To address this gap, we propose a dual-innovation strategy\nintegrating bioinspired structural engineering and composite property\nsynergy. First, we developed an aramid-fiber\ndecompilation/reconstruction process using ultrasound-assisted\nhydrothermal cracking to produce platelet nanofibers. Second, a dynamic\nicetemplating technique was employed to create annular temperature\ngradients, enabling directional self-assembly of nanofibers into\ndensity-gradient pore architectures. This bioinspired based design not\nonly replicates the structural complexity of natural systems and\nrealizes the interfacial synergy of the components (embodied by a\nnegative Poisson's ratio of-0.30 and an ultra-high porosity of 94.20\n\\%), but also confers an excellent fatigue resistance to Si@ANF/CNF\naerogel, which maintains a strain retention rate of 83.06 \\% after 100\ncycles of 50 \\% strain. The resulting composite system demonstrates\nexceptional multifunctionality, including excellent oil-water separation\ncapability (49-102 g/g, 99.76 \\% water repellency) and superior thermal\ninsulation (0.044 W/m \\& sdot;K at 160 degrees C). By demonstrating that\nbioinspired structural precision inherently enables multifunctional\noptimization, this work bridges the gap between natural design\nprinciples and scalable engineering solutions, offering a sustainable\nplatform for advanced aerogel applications.",

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity threats continue to escalate with the rapid advancement of\ninternet technology, with malicious code posing a particularly daunting\nchallenge. Traditional detection methods based on feature code matching\nstruggle to keep pace with evolving anti-detection techniques and the\nproliferation of malicious code variants. Current malware detection\noften relies on extracting opcode sequences or converting binary files\ninto grayscale maps for analysis based on deep learning. However,\ntext-based methods for malware detection face decompilation errors due\nto obfuscation, which compromise feature extraction accuracy, and the\nlimitation of n-gram in capturing global behavior patterns beyond local\nopcode sequences. Image-based methods, on the other hand, risk losing\ncode structure and semantics during image conversion, and the need for\nfixed-size inputs in convolutional neural networks can lead to feature\ninformation loss during resizing or cropping. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes feature fusion-based squeeze and\nexcitation (FFSE)-bidirectional temporal convolutional network (BiTCN),\na novel hybrid malware detection model that integrates the advantages of\nFFSE and BiTCN. The FFSE is utilized to extract multi-scale features and\nfuse global and local features with a channel attention mechanism, while\nthe BiTCN is adopted to capture temporal evolution of malware behavior\nand integrate features of different levels with a pooling fusion\nmechanism. Experimental results on the BIG2015 and DataCon datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing malware\ndetection methods in terms of Accuracy , Recall , and F1-score . It\nproves the robustness and generalization of the proposed model and\ncontributes significantly to the field of malware detection.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of Android-based mobile and IoT applications has\nsignificantly increased the attack surface for malicious actors. These\nadversaries often exploit apps and social engineering to deliver malware\nthat compromises device security and user privacy. To address this\nongoing threat, we present AndroMD, an intelligent and scalable Android\nmalware detection framework that combines automated dataset\nconstruction, optimal feature selection, and ensemble-based\nclassification. The proposed framework is built on three core\ncomponents. First, an automated pipeline processes over 600,000 APKs to\nextract static features from more than 140 million Java files and\n600,000 manifest files, resulting in three distinct datasets: KeyCount,\nZeroOne, and MNF. These datasets are constructed using keys and patterns\nderived from a detailed analysis of real decompiled malware code,\nensuring semantic relevance. Second, we introduce the AndroMD Optimal\nFeature Selection (AOFS) method, which selects compact, high-performing\nfeature subsets using iterative evaluation based on ensemble feedback.\nThird, an ensemble detection model combines Random Forest, Decision\nTree, and Bagging classifiers, with a threshold-based aggregation\nmechanism that allows fine-grained control over detection sensitivity.\nExtensive evaluation demonstrates AndroMD's strong performance,\nachieving up to 99.88\\% accuracy on internal datasets and 91.66\\%\naccuracy in live testing, including detection of custom and zero-day\nmalware samples. AndroMD also identifies threats overlooked by\nVirusTotal, showcasing its real-world applicability. The framework,\nalong with sample datasets and code, is made publicly available to\nsupport reproducibility and further research on Android security.",

    "abstract": "Malware detection is a necessity in the modern digital world. This\nresearch presents a novel MalSFF: Multi-Architecture Malware Detection\nUsing Multi-Static Feature Fusion Based on visual image analysis and\ntransfer learning. Firstly, it decompiles binary programs to extract\nbytecodes and assembly code (ASM) through reverse-engineering before\ntransforming them into grayscale images. This research strategically\nfine-tunes the MobileNet models (V1, V2, V3-Small, and V3-Large) for\nfeature extraction of both file types. Thereafter, it performs feature\nstacking through early fusion, late fusion, and ensemble voting to\nobtain a single feature map, and then utilizes a filter-based feature\nselection algorithm. Finally, the MalSFF employs six different\nclassifiers, with optimized hyperparameters using an automated\ngrid-search algorithm. For better generalization, this study uses four\ndifferent datasets: (i) Microsoft BIG, (ii) MalImg, (iii) Dumpware10,\nand (iv) Real-world samples. The MalSFF achieved 98.72\\% accuracy for\nthe MalImg and 96.93\\% accuracy, 97\\% precision, 97\\% recall, and 97\\%\nF1-score, 0.012 ms of response time for the BIG dataset. For\nmemory-resident malware, it achieved 93.84\\% accuracy and a 91\\%\nF1-score, with a response time of only 0.05 s. The MalSFF demonstrates\nresilience against FGSM, PGD, and DeepFool adversarial attacks. The\nMalSFF is a lightweight and computationally efficient, well-suited for\nresource-constrained IIoT networks.",

To demonstrate applicability of our algorithms, we designed symbolic derivatives for CF-GKAT, a practical system based on GKAT designed to validate control-flow transformations. We implemented the algorithms in Rust and evaluated them on both randomly generated benchmarks and real-world control-flow transformations. Indeed, we observed order-of-magnitude performance improvements against existing implementations for both KAT and CF-GKAT.

In this work, we conduct a benchmark-driven evaluation of decompilation quality across core Rust features and compiler build modes. Our automated scoring framework shows that generic types, trait methods, and error handling constructs significantly reduce decompilation quality, especially in release builds. Through representative case studies, we analyze how specific language constructs affect control flow, variable naming, and type information recovery. Our findings provide actionable insights for tool developers and highlight the need for Rust-aware decompilation strategies. ",
