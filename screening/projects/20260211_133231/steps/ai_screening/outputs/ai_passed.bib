  abstract = {The decompiler is one of the most common tools for examining binaries without corresponding source code. It transforms binaries into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Decompilers can reconstruct much of the information that is lost during the compilation process (e.g., structure and type information). Unfortunately, they do not reconstruct semantically meaningful variable names, which are known to increase code understandability. We propose the Decompiled Identifier Renaming Engine (DIRE), a novel probabilistic technique for variable name recovery that uses both lexical and structural information recovered by the decompiler. We also present a technique for generating corpora suitable for training and evaluating models of decompiled code renaming, which we use to create a corpus of 164,632 unique x86-64 binaries generated from C projects mined from GitHub.1 Our results show that on this corpus DIRE can predict variable names identical to the names in the original source code up to 74.3% of the time.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for generating formally proven equivalence theorems between decompiled x86-64 machine code and big step semantics. These proofs are built on top of two additional contributions. First, a robust and tested formal x86-64 machine model containing small step semantics for 1625 instructions. Second, a decompilation-into-logic methodology supporting both x86-64 assembly and machine code at large scale. This work enables black-box binary verification, i.e., formal verification of a binary where source code is unavailable. As such, it can be applied to safety-critical systems that consist of legacy components, or components whose source code is unavailable due to proprietary reasons. The methodology minimizes the trusted code base by leveraging machine-learned semantics to build a formal machine model. We apply the methodology to several case studies, including binaries that heavily rely on the SSE2 floating-point instruction set, and binaries that are obtained by compiling code that is obtained by inlining assembly into C code.},

  abstract = {Binary type inference is a critical reverse engineering task supporting many security applications, including vulnerability analysis, binary hardening, forensics, and decompilation. It is a difficult task because source-level type information is often stripped during compilation, leaving only binaries with untyped memory and register accesses. Existing approaches rely on hand-coded type inference rules defined by domain experts, which are brittle and require nontrivial effort to maintain and update. Even though machine learning approaches have shown promise at automatically learning the inference rules, their accuracy is still low, especially for optimized binaries.  We present StateFormer, a new neural architecture that is adept at accurate and robust type inference. StateFormer follows a two-step transfer learning paradigm. In the pretraining step, the model is trained with Generative State Modeling (GSM), a novel task that we design to teach the model to statically approximate execution effects of assembly instructions in both forward and backward directions. In the finetuning step, the pretrained model learns to use its knowledge of operational semantics to infer types.  We evaluate StateFormer's performance on a corpus of 33 popular open-source software projects containing over 1.67 billion variables of different types. The programs are compiled with GCC and LLVM over 4 optimization levels O0-O3, and 3 obfuscation passes based on LLVM. Our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ML-based tools by 14.6% in recovering types for both function arguments and variables. Our ablation studies show that GSM improves type inference accuracy by 33%.},

  abstract = {The call stack represents one of the core abstractions that compiler-generated programs leverage to organize binary execution at runtime. For many use cases reasoning about stack accesses of binary functions is crucial: security-sensitive applications may require patching even after deployment, and binary instrumentation, rewriting, and lifting all necessitate detailed knowledge about the function frame layout of the affected program. As no comprehensive solution to the stack symbolization problem exists to date, existing approaches have to resort to workarounds like emulated stack environments, resulting in increased runtime overheads.In this paper we present StackBERT, a framework to statically reason about and reliably recover stack frame information of binary functions in stripped and highly optimized programs. The core idea behind our approach is to formulate binary analysis as a self-supervised learning problem by automatically generating ground truth data from a large corpus of open-source programs. We train a state-of-the-art Transformer model with self-attention and finetune for stack frame size prediction. We show that our finetuned model yields highly accurate estimates of a binary function's stack size from its function body alone across different instruction-set architectures, compiler toolchains, and optimization levels. We successfully verify the static estimates against runtime data through dynamic executions of standard benchmarks and additional studies, demonstrating that StackBERT's predictions generalize to 93.44% of stripped and highly optimized test binaries not seen during training. We envision these results to be useful for improving binary rewriting and lifting approaches in the future.},

  abstract = {The increasing popularity of WebAssembly creates a demand for understanding and reverse engineering WebAssembly binaries. Recovering high-level function types is an important part of this process. One method to recover types is data-flow analysis, but it is complex to implement and may require manual heuristics when logical constraints fall short. In contrast, this paper presents SnowWhite, a learning-based approach for recovering precise, high-level parameter and return types for WebAssembly functions. It improves over prior work on learning-based type recovery by representing the types-to-predict in an expressive type language, which can describe a large number of complex types, instead of the fixed, and usually small type vocabulary used previously. Thus, recovery of a single type is no longer a classification task but sequence prediction, for which we build on the success of neural sequence-to-sequence models. We evaluate SnowWhite on a new, large-scale dataset of 6.3 million type samples extracted from 300,905 WebAssembly object files. The results show the type language is expressive, precisely describing 1,225 types instead the 7 to 35 types considered in previous learning-based approaches. Despite this expressiveness, our type recovery has high accuracy, exactly matching 44.5% (75.2%) of all parameter types and 57.7% (80.5%) of all return types within the top-1 (top-5) predictions.},

State-of-the-art techniques use machine learning to predict missing information like variable names. While these approaches are often able to suggest good variable names in context, no existing work examines how the selection of training data influences these machine learning models. We investigate how data provenance and the quality of training data affect performance, and how well, if at all, trained models generalize across software domains. We focus on the variable renaming problem using one such machine learning model, DIRE. We first describe DIRE in detail and the accompanying technique used to generate training data from raw code. We also evaluate DIRE’s overall performance without respect to data quality. Next, we show how training on more popular, possibly higher quality code (measured using GitHub stars) leads to a more generalizable model because popular code tends to have more diverse variable names. Finally, we evaluate how well DIRE predicts domain-specific identifiers, propose a modification to incorporate domain information, and show that it can predict identifiers in domain-specific scenarios 23% more frequently than the original DIRE model.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts play an increasingly important role in Ethereum platform. It provides various functions implementing numerous services, whose bytecode runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine. To use services by invoking corresponding functions, the callers need to know the function signatures. Moreover, such signatures provide crucial information for many downstream applications, e.g., identifying smart contracts, fuzzing, detecting vulnerabilities, etc. However, it is challenging to infer function signatures from the bytecode due to a lack of type information. Existing work solving this problem depended heavily on limited databases or hard-coded heuristic patterns. However, these approaches are hard to be adapted to semantic differences in distinct languages and various compiler versions when developing smart contracts. In this paper, we propose a novel framework DeepInfer that first leverages deep learning techniques to automatically infer function signatures and returns. The novelties of DeepInfer are: 1) DeepInfer lifts the bytecode into the Intermediate Representation (IR) to preserve code semantics; 2) DeepInfer extracts the type-related knowledge (e.g., critical data flows, constant values, and control flow graphs) from the IR to recover function signatures and returns. We conduct experiments on Solidity and Vyper smart contracts and the results show that DeepInfer performs faster and more accurate than existing tools, while being immune to changes in different languages and various compiler versions.},

Aiming at the shortcomings of the pseudocode abstract syntax tree being difficult to extract and the binary function naming scheme having low accuracy rate, a binary function naming prediction model A2N based on variable alignment and sequence translation model is proposed. First, A2N extracts the function variable features of binary files from debugging information and performs variable alignment with the pseudocode obtained from decompiling; then, it obtains the hierarchical structure of the binary functions and designs the node extraction rules to generate an abstract syntax tree AST for each function; then, extract the paths between the leaf nodes of the AST and serialize the tree structure to represent it; finally, with the help of the neural network translation model, establish a mapping between the AST and the binary function names to realize the prediction function. The experimental results show that compared with Dire, Nero and XFL models, the F1 value of A2N is improved by 84%, 44% and 14% on file-level isolation experiments respectively, and the F1 value reaches 80.94% on function-level isolation experiments.},

  abstract = {Decompilation aims to recover a binary executable to the source code form and hence has a wide range of applications in cyber security, such as malware analysis and legacy code hardening. A prominent challenge is to recover variable symbols, including both primitive and complex types such as user-defined data structures, along with their symbol information such as names and types. Existing efforts focus on solving parts of the problem, e.g., recovering only types (without names) or only local variables (without user-defined structures). In this paper, we propose ReSym, a novel hybrid technique that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and program analysis to recover both names and types for local variables and user-defined data structures. Our method encompasses fine-tuning two LLMs to handle local variables and structures, respectively. To overcome the token limitations inherent in current LLMs, we devise a novel Prolog-based algorithm to aggregate and cross-check results from multiple LLM queries, suppressing uncertainty and hallucinations. Our experiments show that ReSym is effective in recovering variable information and user-defined data structures, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.},

Most of the reverse engineering tools have been developed from a practical point of view, and do not provide any guarantees with their results. Recently, formally verified reverse engineering and decompilation have gained traction. These formal tools are for the most part proof-of-concept systems not yet suitable for real-world reverse-engineering tasks. In this poster, we explore the idea of formalizing part of an existing decompilation tool instead. We focus on the lifting from assembly to the IR P-Code in one of the most popular decompilers, Ghidra. This step occurs immediately after disassembly. We are developing a proof system inside the Isabelle theorem prover, to automatically prove semantical equivalence between the assembly and P-Code instructions. We leverage machine-learned x86-64 semantics, to stay as close as possible to actual CPU behavior. This approach has uncovered several shortcomings in Ghidra's P-Code and the lifting it performs. By using a theorem prover, we obtain guarantees that our system of formal semantics and lifting is internally consistent. This work brings the powerful guarantees that formal methods provide in reverse engineering research to the real world.},

Traditional analysis methods are limited by software complexity and emerging types in real-world projects. To address these limitations, machine learning methods have been explored. However, the existing supervised learning approaches struggle with analyzing complicated and uncommon types due to the limited availability of samples. Additionally, none of the existing works can capture fine-grained and inter-procedural features in the binaries. In this paper, we present TypeFSL, a framework that addresses the challenge of imbalanced type distributions by incorporating few-shot learning and captures inter-procedural semantics through program slicing. Moreover, based on a dataset with 3,003,117 functions, TypeFSL achieves an average of 77.9% and 84.6% accuracy across all architecture and optimizations in 20-way 5-shot and 10-shot classification tasks.

  abstract = {The vision of Web3 is to improve user control over data and assets, but one challenge that complicates this vision is the prevalence of non-transparent, scam-prone applications and vulnerable smart contracts that put Web3 users at risk. While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code with prompt engineering. Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 73.33% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance, suggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs continue to advance. In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, improving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart contracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3 projects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD. MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education. It empowers users to easily and independently review and audit non-open-source smart contracts, fostering accountability and decentralization. Moreover, MAD's methodology could potentially extend to other smart contract languages, like Solidity, further enhancing Web3 transparency.},

Existing decompilers, such as IDA Pro and Ghidra, focus on enhancing the readability of decompiled code rather than its recompilability, which limits further programmatic use, such as for CodeQL-based vulnerability analysis that requires compilable versions of the decompiled code. Recent LLM-based approaches for enhancing decompilation results, while useful for human RE analysts, unfortunately also follow the same path.    In this paper, we explore, for the first time, how off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) can be used to enable recompilable decompilation—automatically correcting decompiler outputs into compilable versions. We first show that this is non-trivial through a pilot study examining existing rule-based and LLM-based approaches. Based on the lessons learned, we design DecLLM, an iterative LLM-based repair loop that utilizes both static recompilation and dynamic runtime feedback as oracles to iteratively fix decompiler outputs. We test DecLLM on popular C benchmarks and real-world binaries using two mainstream LLMs, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and show that off-the-shelf LLMs can achieve an upper bound of around 70% recompilation success rate, i.e., 70 out of 100 originally non-recompilable decompiler outputs are now recompilable. We also demonstrate the practical applicability of the recompilable code for CodeQL-based vulnerability analysis, which is impossible to perform directly on binaries. For the remaining 30% of hard cases, we further delve into their errors to gain insights for future improvements in decompilation-oriented LLM design.},

In this paper, we propose DiSCo, the first LLMs-based EVM decompilation pipeline, which aims to enable LLMs to understand the opaque bytecode and lift it into smart contract code. DiSCo introduces three core technologies. First, a logic-invariant intermediate representation is proposed to reproject the low-level bytecode into high-level abstracted units. The second technique involves semantic enhancement based on a novel type-aware graph model to infer stripped variables during compilation, enhancing the lifting effect. The third technology is a flexible method incorporating code specifications to construct LLM-comprehensible prompts for source code generation. Extensive experiments illustrate that our generated code guarantees a high compilability rate at 75%, with differential fuzzing pass rate averaging at 50%. Manual validation results further indicate that the generated solidity contracts significantly outperforms baseline methods in tasks such as code comprehension and attack reproduction.},

  abstract = {Recovering semantic information from binary code is a fundamental challenge in reverse engineering, especially when source-level information is unavailable. We aim to analyze the types and roles of structural elements from the binary observed in the compiled program, focusing on their contextual usage patterns and associations to other members.We refer to such semantic aspects as structural semantics , meaning that cooccurring patterns of jointly updated structure members reveal the functional roles that can be inferred from their coupling, throughout this paper. Recent approaches have applied graph neural networks (GNNs) to data-flow graphs (DFGs) for variable type inference, but most rely on a single model architecture, such as the relational graph convolutional network (R-GCN). While effective, such models may overlook alternative patterns of structure member behavior. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of three alternative GNN architectures gated graph neural networks (GGNN), graph attention networks (GAT), and standard graph convolutional networks (GCN) in capturing structural semantics from binary-level data-flow graphs. We evaluate these models on real-world binaries compiled at multiple optimization levels, measuring their ability to infer semantic properties of structure members. Our results show that these architectures capture complementary aspects of structural semantics. GGNN is effective at modeling long-range dependencies, GAT suppresses irrelevant connections, and GCN offers computational simplicity. Different model architectures emphasize distinct aspects of structural semantics, capturing complementary patterns of how structure members are accessed together in memory. This demonstrates that architectural diversity provides richer perspectives for semantic inference in binary analysis.},

  abstract = {Analysis of binary executables implementing mathematical equations can benefit from the reverse engineering of semantic information about the implementation. Traditional algorithmic reverse engineering tools either do not recover semantic information or rely on dynamic analysis and symbolic execution with high reverse engineering time. Algorithmic tools also require significant re-engineering effort to target new platforms and languages. Recently, neural methods for decompilation have been developed to recover human-like source code, but they do not extract semantic information explicitly. We develop REMEND, a neural decompilation framework to reverse engineer math equations from binaries to explicitly recover program semantics like data flow and order of operations. REMEND combines a transformer encoder-decoder model for neural decompilation with algorithmic processing for enhanced symbolic reasoning necessary for math equations. REMEND is the first work to demonstrate that transformers for neural decompilation go beyond source code and reason about program semantics in the form of math equations. We train on a synthetically generated dataset containing multiple implementations and compilations of math equations to produce a robust neural decompilation model and demonstrate retargettability. REMEND obtains an accuracy of 89.8% to 92.4% across three Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), three optimization levels, and two programming languages with a single trained model, extending the capability of state-of-the-art neural decompilers. We achieve high accuracy with a small model of upto 12 million parameters and an average execution time of 0.132 seconds per function. On a real-world dataset collected from open-source programs, REMEND generalizes better than state-of-the-art neural decompilers despite being trained with synthetic data, achieving 8% higher accuracy. The synthetic and real-world datasets are provided at .},

Unfortunately, the lack of semantic information like variable types makes comprehending binaries difficult. In efforts to improve the comprehensibility of binaries, researchers have recently used machine learning techniques to predict semantic information contained in the original source code. Chen et al. implemented DIRTY, a Transformer-based Encoder-Decoder architecture capable of augmenting decompiled code with variable names and types by leveraging decompiler output tokens and variable size information. Chen et al. were able to demonstrate a substantial increase in name and type extraction accuracy on Hex-Rays decompiler outputs compared to existing static analysis and AI-based techniques. We extend the original DIRTY results by re-training the DIRTY model on a dataset produced by the open-source Ghidra decompiler. Although Chen et al. concluded that Ghidra was not a suitable decompiler candidate due to its difficulty in parsing and incorporating DWARF symbols during analysis, we demonstrate that straightforward parsing of variable data generated by Ghidra results in similar retyping performance. We hope this work inspires further interest and adoption of the Ghidra decompiler for use in research projects.},

  abstract = {Conducting binary function naming helps reverse engineers understand the internal workings of the code and perform malicious code analysis without accessing the source code. However, the loss of debugging information poses the challenge of insufficient high-level semantic information description for stripping binary code function naming. Meanwhile, the existing binary function naming scheme has one function label for only one sample. The long-tail effect of function labels for a single sample makes the machine learning-based prediction models face the challenge. To obtain a function correlation label and improve the propensity score of uncommon tail labels, we propose a multi-label learning-based binary function naming model BContext2Name. This model automatically generates relevant labels for binary function naming by function context information with the help of PfastreXML model. The experimental results show that BContext2Name can enrich function labels and alleviate the long-tail effect that exists for a single sample class. To obtain high-level semantics of binary functions, we align pseudocode and basic blocks based on disassembly and decompilation, identify concrete or abstract values of API parameters by variable tracking, and construct API-enhanced control flow graphs. Finally, a seq2seq neural network translation model with attention mechanism is constructed between function multi-label learning and enhanced control flow graphs. Experiments on the dataset reveal that the F1 values of the BContext2Name model improve by 3.55% and 15.23% over the state-of-the-art XFL and Nero, respectively. This indicates that function multi-label learning can provide accurate labels for binary functions and can help reverse analysts understand the inner working mechanism of binary code.

  abstract = {Building a model to reassign descriptive names for binary functions is considerable assistance for reverse engineering. Existing methods proposed for this issue are based on the low-level representation of binary code (e.g., assembly code), and especially the recent approaches employed neural-based models on instruction sequences. However, their performance is still unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, modern decompilers provide lifted representations of binary code, and their effectiveness has not been adequately studied. This paper further explores the issue of function name reassignment from the perspective of binary code representation. Specifically, we present a general and flexible NEural-based function name Reassignment framework NER, which leverages a decompiler to obtain a specific representation and applies the corresponding serialization strategy on it. NER then uses an alternative neural network to make predictions. Three levels of representation are investigated, including assembly code, Intermediate Representation (IR), and pseudo-code. We observe the binary code representations are significant for the final performance. It demonstrates that the pseudo-code is the most effective one. Based on these findings, we leverage the framework to implement a reassignment model NER-pc, which has 25% and 10% F1 score improvements against the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, more experiments are conducted to verify the design of NER and the effectiveness of NER-pc.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a well-studied area with numerous high-quality tools available. These are frequently used for security tasks and to port legacy code. However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. Nevertheless, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect. This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompiler based on a sequence-to-sequence Transformer trained over real-world code and augmented with a type inference engine. We utilize a novel tokenizer, dropout-free regularization, and type inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code. We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 ExeBench functions on two ISAs and at two optimization levels. SLaDe is up to 6× more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4× more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both.},

For this purpose, the author's approach of “Genetic Reverse Engineering of Machine Code” (GREMC) is proposed. The essence of this approach lies in the use of artificial intelligence in the field of genetic algorithms to restore the source code of software executed in the form of machine code on cyber-physical devices for Industry 4.0. The resulting code can then be analysed for vulnerabilities by an expert. One issue that arises during genetic reverse engineering is predicting the size of the source code based on its machine representation (i.e., in an object or executable file). The article is devoted to solving this problem for functions in the C programming language. To do this, a method for obtaining a relationship between the sizes of the source and machine code of individual functions is described, which consists of steps such as loading a dataset with C-functions, isolating the function code in it, preprocessing them, compiling them into machine code, calculating the required sizes, building dependencies between each source code size and the corresponding machine code sizes, generating the final table and determining the dependency formula. An experiment is carried out using a software prototype that implements the method; ExeBench with 83 thousand C-functions is taken as a dataset. Justifications are given regarding the appearance of abnormal machine code sizes and their impact on the dependence formula.},

Information about the source code is irrevocably lost in the compilation process. While modern decompilers attempt to generate C-style source code from a binary, they cannot recover lost variable names. Prior works have explored machine learning techniques for predicting variable names in decompiled code. However, the state-of-the-art systems, DIRE and DIRTY, generalize poorly to functions in the testing set that are not included in the training set—31.8% for DIRE on DIRTY’s data set and 36.9% for DIRTY on DIRTY’s data set.In this paper, we present VarBERT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to predict meaningful variable names in decompilation output. An advantage of VarBERT is that we can pre-train on human source code and then fine-tune the model to the task of predicting variable names. We also create a new data set VarCorpus, which significantly expands the size and variety of the data set. Our evaluation of VarBERT on VarCorpus, demonstrates a significant improvement in predicting the developer’s original variable names for O2 optimized binaries achieving accuracies of 54.43% for IDA and 54.49% for Ghidra. VarBERT is strictly better than state-of-the-art techniques: On a subset of VarCorpus, VarBERT could predict the developer’s original variable names 50.70% of the time, while DIRE and DIRTY predicted original variable names 35.94% and 38.00% of the time, respectively.},

Despite its advantages, Wasm’s binary nature presents significant challenges for developers and researchers, particularly regarding readability when debugging or analyzing web applications. Therefore, effective decompilation becomes crucial. Unfortunately, traditional decompilers often struggle with producing readable outputs. While some large language model (LLM)-based decompilers have shown good compatibility with general binary files, they still face specific challenges when dealing with Wasm.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, WaDec, which is the first use of a fine-tuned LLM to interpret and decompile Wasm binary code into a higher-level, more comprehensible source code representation. The LLM was meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of wat-c code snippets, employing self-supervised learning techniques. This enables WaDec to effectively decompile not only complete wat functions but also finer-grained wat code snippets. Our experiments demonstrate that WaDec markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art tools, offering substantial improvements across several metrics. It achieves a code inflation rate of only 3.34%, a dramatic 97% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art’s 116.94%. Unlike the output of baselines that cannot be directly compiled or executed, WaDec maintains a recompilability rate of 52.11%, a re-execution rate of 43.55%, and an output consistency of 27.15%. Additionally, it significantly exceeds state-of-the-art performance in AST edit distance similarity by 185%, cyclomatic complexity by 8%, and cosine similarity by 41%, achieving an average code similarity above 50%. In summary, WaDec enhances understanding of the code’s structure and execution flow, facilitating automated code analysis, optimization, and security auditing.},

Although decompiling Java bytecode is easier than bytecode, many Java decompilers cannot recover originally lost sources, especially the selection statement, i.e., if statement. This deficiency affects directly decompilation performance. In this paper, we propose the methodology for guiding Java decompiler to deal with the aforementioned problem. In the framework, Java bytecode is transformed into two kinds of features called frame feature and latent semantic feature. The former is extracted directly from the bytecode. The latter is achieved by two-step transforming the Java bytecode to bigram and then term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF). After that, both of them are fed to the genetic algorithm to reduce their dimensions. The proposed feature is achieved by converting the selected TFIDF to a latent semantic feature and concatenating it with the selected frame feature. Finally, KNN is used to classify the proposed feature. The experimental results show that the decompilation accuracy is 93.68 percent, which is obviously better than Java Decompiler.},

Despite demand for Python decompilers, community efforts to maintain automatic Python decompilation tools have been hindered by Python's aggressive language improvements and unstable bytecode specification. Every year, language features are added, code generation undergoes significant changes, and opcodes are added, deleted, and modified. Our research aims to integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with classical Programming Language (PL) theory to create a Python decompiler that accomodates evolving language features and changes to the bytecode specification with minimal human maintenance effort. PyLINGUAL plugs in data-driven NLP components to a version-agnostic core to automatically absorb superficial bytecode and compiler changes, while leveraging programmatic components for abstract control flow reconstruction. To establish trust in the decompilation results, we introduce a stringent correctness measure based on “perfect decompilation”, a statically verifiable refinement of semantic equivalence. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with extensive real-world datasets of benign and malicious Python source code and their corresponding compiled PYC binaries. Our research makes three major contributions: (1) we present PyLINGUAL, a scalable, data-driven decompilation framework with state-of-the-art support for Python versions 3.6 through 3.12, improving the perfect decompilation rate by an average of 45% over the best results of existing decompiler across four datasets; (2) we provide a Python decompiler evaluation framework that verifies decompilation results with perfect decompilation; and (3) we launch PyLINGUAL as a public online service.},

  abstract = {Static binary analysis is a widely used approach for ensuring the security of closed-source software. However, the absence of type information in stripped binaries, particularly for composite data types, poses significant challenges for both static analyzers and reverse engineering experts in achieving efficient and accurate analysis. Existing methods often struggle with inaccuracies and scalability limitations when dealing with such data types. To address these problems, we present Typeforge, a novel approach inspired by the workflow of reverse engineering experts, which uses a two-stage synthesis-selection strategy to automate the recovery of composite data types from stripped binaries. We design a new graph structure, the Type Flow Graph (TFG) to represent type information within stripped binaries. In the first stage, TFG-based Type Synthesis focuses on efficiently and accurately building constraints and synthesizing possible composite type declarations from the stripped binaries. In the second stage, we propose an LLM-assisted double-elimination framework to select the best-fit type declaration from the candidates by assessing the readability of the decompiled code. Our comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrates that TYPEFORGE achieves F1 scores of 81.7% and 88.2% in Composite Data Type Identification and Layout Recovery, respectively, substantially outperforming existing methods. Additionally, TYPEFORGE achieves an F1 score of 72.1% in Relationship Recovery, a particularly challenging task for previous approaches. Furthermore, TYPEFORGE has significantly lower time overhead, requiring only about 3.8% of the time taken by OSPREY, the best-performing existing approach, making it a promising solution for various real-world reverse engineering tasks.},

  abstract = {Reverse engineering is a crucial technique in software security, enabling professionals to analyze malware, identify vulnerabilities, and patch legacy software without access to source code. Although decompilers attempt to reconstruct high-level code from binaries, essential information, such as variable names and types, is often dissimilar from the original version, hindering readability and comprehension.Recent advancements have employed AI to enhance decompiler output by recovering original variable names and types. Traditional evaluation of recovery techniques relies on measuring similarity between original and recovered names, assuming that higher similarity enhances readability. However, studies suggest that these "intrinsic" metrics may not accurately predict "extrinsic" outcomes like user comprehension or task performance, revealing a gap in understanding readability and cognitive load in reverse engineering.This paper presents an extrinsic evaluation of machine-generated variable and type names, focusing on their impact on reverse engineers’ comprehension of decompiled code. We conducted a user study with 40 participants—including students and professionals—to assess code comprehension both with and without AI-generated variable and type name assistance. Our findings indicate a lack of correlation between traditional machine learning metrics and actual comprehension gains, highlighting limitations in current evaluation techniques. Despite this, participants showed a preference for AI-augmented decompiler outputs. These insights contribute to understanding the effectiveness of automatic recovery techniques in enhancing reverse engineering tasks and underscore the need for comprehensive, user-centered evaluation frameworks.},

  abstract = {Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate function identification, incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of SA’s accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM’s capability in semantic prediction. More specifically, SmartHalo constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart contract functions shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o mini with SmartHalo further enhances its performance, achieving a precision of 91.32% and a recall of 87.38% for function boundaries, a precision of 90.40% and a recall of 88.82% for variable types, and a precision of 80.66% and a recall of 91.78% for contract attributes.},

  abstract = {The growing demand for high-performance tensor programs on GPUs, especially for large language models (LLMs), necessitates advanced compilation and optimization techniques. However, the critical task of analyzing optimized, low-level PTX code for performance tuning or understanding poses significant challenges. While LLMs hold promise for PTX-to-CUDA de-compilation to improve code intelligibility, their effectiveness is severely limited by the scarcity of aligned training data and the inherent complexity of highly optimized, unrolled PTX code.In this work, we explore methodologies to significantly enhance LLM capabilities for accurate and readable PTX-to-CUDA decompilation and present PtxDec, a decompilation prototype implementing our approach. To overcome the critical barrier of data scarcity, we develop a compiler-based data augmentation framework coupled with rigorous post-processing, enabling the creation of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of 400K aligned CUDA-PTX kernel pairs for effective LLM training. Furthermore, to empower LLMs to handle the complexity of optimized PTX, we introduce Rolled-PTX—an intermediate representation generated through heuristic loop rerolling during preprocessing. Rolled-PTX condenses unrolled patterns, drastically simplifying the input structure presented to the LLM and aligning it better with higher-level loop constructs.Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PtxDec achieves substantial performance gains: our approach yields a 2.3×–3.1× improvement in functional accuracy over baseline methods, alongside significant enhancements in generated code readability and scheduling consistency with the original optimized kernels. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed component to the overall performance.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work tackling PTX-to-CUDA decompilation, specifically focusing on and demonstrating effective strategies for augmenting LLMs to overcome the key challenges in this domain.},

  abstract = {Decompilation can convert binary programs into clear C-style pseudocode, which is of great value in a wide range of security applications. Existing research primarily focuses on recovering symbolic information in pseudocode, such as function names, variable names, and data types, but neglecting structural information. We observe that even when symbolic information is fully preserved, severe and complex structure distortions remain in the pseudocode, greatly impairing code readability and comprehension. In this work, we first systematically investigate structure distortions in decompiled pseudocode, revealing their variation patterns through quantitative analysis. Using open coding, we derive a taxonomy comprising six top-level categories of structure distortions. Building upon this taxonomy, we propose PseudoFix, a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-based in-context learning. PseudoFix employs semantic retrieval to select the most relevant few-shot examples that provide structure distortion knowledge, and combines this with the well-structured coding patterns learned by LLMs from vast source code repositories, to efficiently refactor distorted pseudocode. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PseudoFix significantly improves pseudocode readability, achieving up to a 34% reduction in Halstead Complexity Effort and a 105% increase in BLEU-4 score. Notably, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both temporary variable elimination and goto statement removal tasks. Additionally, human evaluations yield consistently positive feedback from users across readability, consistency, and reasonability.},

  abstract = {Decompilation plays a critical role in firmware analysis and reverse engineering by enabling the recovery of high-level source code from binary executables. However, existing neural decompilation models often face challenges due to the semantic gap between assembly code and high-level languages, and they typically require large-scale models that impose significant computational demands. In this paper, we propose DECodeT5, a lightweight and efficient neural decompilation method for the C language. DECodeT5 builds upon the CodeT5 code generation model by integrating a pre-trained assembly encoder in place of its original embedding layer. This modification allows for more effective semantic learning from assembly code, improving the model’s ability to capture the intricacies of assembly-to-source code mapping. The architecture of DECodeT5 not only accelerates convergence during end-to-end decompilation tasks but also supports rapid adaptation across different compilers and instruction set architectures (ISAs) by swapping out the encoder module as needed. Our experimental evaluation on the HumanEval and Exebench benchmarks reveals that DECodeT5 significantly improves semantic recovery accuracy, outperforming Ghidra by over 83% and LLM4Decompile by more than 43% in terms of execution recovery. Furthermore, DECodeT5 maintains a compact model size of only 360M parameters, providing inference speeds that are twice as fast as LLM4Decompile. These results underscore DECodeT5’s suitability for deployment in resource-constrained environments and its flexibility in adapting to real-world reverse engineering scenarios, offering a practical solution for modern firmware analysis and security tasks.},

  abstract = {Decompilation, recovering source code from binary, is useful in many situations where it is necessary to analyze or understand software for which source code is not available. Source code is much easier for humans to read than binary code, and there are many tools available to analyze source code. Existing decompilation techniques often generate source code that is difficult for humans to understand because the generated code often does not use the coding idioms that programmers use. Differences from human-written code also reduce the effectiveness of analysis tools on the decompiled source code. To address the problem of differences between decompiled code and human-written code, we present a novel technique for decompiling binary code snippets using a model based on Recurrent Neural Networks. The model learns properties and patterns that occur in source code and uses them to produce decompilation output. We train and evaluate our technique on snippets of binary machine code compiled from C source code. The general approach we outline in this paper is not language-specific and requires little or no domain knowledge of a language and its properties or how a compiler operates, making the approach easily extensible to new languages and constructs. Furthermore, the technique can be extended and applied in situations to which traditional decompilers are not targeted, such as for decompilation of isolated binary snippets; fast, on-demand decompilation; domain-specific learned decompilation; optimizing for readability of decompilation; and recovering control flow constructs, comments, and variable or function names. We show that the translations produced by this technique are often accurate or close and can provide a useful picture of the snippet's behavior.},

  abstract = {When code is compiled, information is lost, including some of the structure of the original source code as well as local identifier names. Existing decompilers can reconstruct much of the original source code, but typically use meaningless placeholder variables for identifier names. Using variable names which are more natural in the given context can make the code much easier to interpret, despite the fact that variable names have no effect on the execution of the program. In theory, it is impossible to recover the original identifier names since that information has been lost. However, most code is natural: it is highly repetitive and predictable based on the context. In this paper we propose a technique that assigns variables meaningful names by taking advantage of this naturalness property. We consider decompiler output to be a noisy distortion of the original source code, where the original source code is transformed into the decompiler output. Using this noisy channel model, we apply standard statistical machine translation approaches to choose natural identifiers, combining a translation model trained on a parallel corpus with a language model trained on unmodified C code. We generate a large parallel corpus from 1.2 TB of C source code obtained from GitHub. Under the most conservative assumptions, our technique is still able to recover the original variable names up to 16.2% of the time, which represents a lower bound for performance.},

  abstract = {Much software, whether beneficent or malevolent, is distributed only as binaries, sans source code. Absent source code, understanding binaries’ behavior can be quite challenging, especially when compiled under higher levels of compiler optimization. These optimizations can transform comprehensible, “natural” source constructions into something entirely unrecognizable. Reverse engineering binaries, especially those suspected of being malevolent or guilty of intellectual property theft, are important and time-consuming tasks. There is a great deal of interest in tools to “decompile” binaries back into more natural source code to aid reverse engineering. Decompilation involves several desirable steps, including recreating source-language constructions, variable names, and perhaps even comments. One central step in creating binaries is optimizing function calls, using steps such as inlining. Recovering these (possibly inlined) function calls from optimized binaries is an essential task that most state-of-the-art decompiler tools try to do but do not perform very well. In this paper, we evaluate a supervised learning approach to the problem of recovering optimized function calls. We leverage open-source software and develop an automated labeling scheme to generate a reasonably large dataset of binaries labeled with actual function usages. We augment this large but limited labeled dataset with a pre-training step, which learns the decompiled code statistics from a much larger unlabeled dataset. Thus augmented, our learned labeling model can be combined with an existing decompilation tool, Ghidra, to achieve substantially improved performance in function call recovery, especially at higher levels of optimization.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to binary decompilation, yet they still treat code as plain text and ignore the graphs that govern program control flow. This limitation often yields syntactically fragile and logically inconsistent output, especially for optimized binaries. This paper presents \textsc\{HELIOS\}, a framework that reframes LLM-based decompilation as a structured reasoning task. \textsc\{HELIOS\} summarizes a binary's control flow and function calls into a hierarchical text representation that spells out basic blocks, their successors, and high-level patterns such as loops and conditionals. This representation is supplied to a general-purpose LLM, along with raw decompiler output, optionally combined with a compiler-in-the-loop that returns error messages when the generated code fails to build. On HumanEval-Decompile for \texttt\{x86\_64\}, \textsc\{HELIOS\} raises average object file compilability from 45.0\% to 85.2\% for Gemini~2.0 and from 71.4\% to 89.6\% for GPT-4.1~Mini. With compiler feedback, compilability exceeds 94\% and functional correctness improves by up to 5.6 percentage points over text-only prompting. Across six architectures drawn from x86, ARM, and MIPS, \textsc\{HELIOS\} reduces the spread in functional correctness while keeping syntactic correctness consistently high, all without fine-tuning. These properties make \textsc\{HELIOS\} a practical building block for reverse engineering workflows in security settings where analysts need recompilable, semantically faithful code across diverse hardware targets. },

Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE. However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively. In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis. Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context. This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3\% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7\% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7\% and 7.4\% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively.

While modern decompilers can reconstruct and recover much information that is discarded during compilation, inferring variable names is still extremely difficult. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing, we propose a novel solution to infer variable names in decompiled code based on Masked Language Modeling, Byte-Pair Encoding, and neural architectures such as Transformers and BERT. Our solution takes \textit\{raw\} decompiler output, the less semantically meaningful code, as input, and enriches it using our proposed \textit\{finetuning\} technique, Constrained Masked Language Modeling. Using Constrained Masked Language Modeling introduces the challenge of predicting the number of masked tokens for the original variable name. We address this \textit\{count of token prediction\} challenge with our post-processing algorithm. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our trained VarBERT model is simpler and of much better performance. We evaluated our model on an existing large-scale data set with 164,632 binaries and showed that it can predict variable names identical to the ones present in the original source code up to 84.15\% of the time. },

It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks. },

Prevailing decompilers struggle to reverse bytecode in a readable manner, often yielding convoluted code that critically hampers vulnerability analysis and thwarts efforts to dissect contract functionalities for security auditing. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a pioneering decompilation pipeline that, for the first time, successfully leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into human-readable and semantically faithful Solidity code. Our novel methodology first employs rigorous static program analysis to convert bytecode into a structured three-address code (TAC) representation. This intermediate representation then guides a Llama-3.2-3B model, specifically fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset of 238,446 TAC-to-Solidity function pairs, to generate high-quality Solidity. This approach uniquely recovers meaningful variable names, intricate control flow, and precise function signatures. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates a significant leap beyond traditional decompilers, achieving an average semantic similarity of 0.82 with original source and markedly superior readability. The practical viability and effectiveness of our research are demonstrated through its implementation in a publicly accessible system, available at https://evmdecompiler.com. },

  abstract = {Decompilers are important tools for reverse engineers that help them analyze software at a higher level of abstraction than assembly code. Unfortunately, because compilation is lossy, deterministic decompilers produce code that is missing many of the details that make source code readable in the first place, like variable names and types. Neural decompilers, on the other hand, offer the ability to statistically fill in these details. Existing work in neural decompilation, however, suffers from substantial limitations that preclude its use on real code, such as the inability to define composite types, which is essential to fully specify function semantics. In this work, we introduce a new dataset, Realtype, that includes substantially more complicated and realistic types than existing neural decompilation benchmarks, and Idioms, a new neural decompilation approach to finetune any LLM into a neural decompiler capable of generating the appropriate user-defined type definitions alongside the decompiled code. We show that our approach yields state-of-the-art results in neural decompilation. On the most challenging existing benchmark, ExeBench, our model achieves 54.4% accuracy vs. 46.3% for LLM4Decompile and 37.5% for Nova; on Realtype, our model performs at least 95% better. },

Decompilers are used when it is necessary to understand or analyze software for which the source code is not available. Although existing decompilers commonly obtain source code with the same behavior as the binaries, that source code is usually hard to interpret and certainly differs from the original code written by the programmer. Massive codebases could be used to build supervised machine learning models aimed at improving existing decompilers. In this article, we build different classification models capable of inferring the high-level type returned by functions, with significantly higher accuracy than existing decompilers. We automatically instrument C source code to allow the association of binary patterns with their corresponding high-level constructs. A dataset is created with a collection of real open-source applications plus a huge number of synthetic programs. Our system is able to predict function return types with a 79.1% F1-measure, whereas the best decompiler obtains a 30% F1-measure. Moreover, we document the binary patterns used by our classifier to allow their addition in the implementation of existing decompilers. },

(2) Fine-grained Alignment Enhancement (FAE), which meticulously aligns assembly code with source code at the statement level by leveraging debugging information, is employed during the fine-tuning phase to achieve further improvements in decompilation. By integrating these two methods, we achieved a Re-Executability performance improvement of approximately 3.90% on the Decompile-Eval benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance of 52.41%.

However, previous end-to-end methods often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these issues, we propose the \textbf\{ReF Decompile\} method, which incorporates the following innovations: (1) The Relabelling strategy replaces jump target addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable information from binary files.

On the one hand, malicious parties may recover interpretable source codes from the software products to gain commercial advantages. On the other hand, binary decompilation can be leveraged for code vulnerability analysis and malware detection. However, efficient binary decompilation is challenging. Conventional decompilers have the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To address the above problems, we propose Coda, the first end-to-end neural-based framework for code decompilation. Coda decomposes the decompilation task into two key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a tree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention feeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches. We assess Coda's performance with extensive experiments on various benchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82\% program recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-art decompilers yield 0\% accuracy. Furthermore, Coda outperforms the sequence-to-sequence model with attention by a margin of 70\% program accuracy. },

Recently, researchers have proposed using techniques from neural machine translation to automate the process in decompilation. Although such techniques hold the promise of targeting a wider range of source and assembly languages, to date they have primarily targeted C code. In this paper we argue that existing neural decompilers have achieved higher accuracy at the cost of requiring language-specific domain knowledge such as tokenizers and parsers to build an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the source language, which increases the overhead of supporting new languages. We explore a different tradeoff that, to the extent possible, treats the assembly and source languages as plain text, and show that this allows us to build a decompiler that is easily retargetable to new languages. We evaluate our prototype decompiler, Beyond The C (BTC), on Go, Fortran, OCaml, and C, and examine the impact of parameters such as tokenization and training data selection on the quality of decompilation, finding that it achieves comparable decompilation results to prior work in neural decompilation with significantly less domain knowledge.

The problem of decompilation is extremely important for security researchers. Finding vulnerabilities and understanding how malware operates is much easier when done over source code. The importance of decompilation has motivated the construction of hand-crafted rule-based decompilers. Such decompilers have been designed by experts to detect specific control-flow structures and idioms in low-level code and lift them to source level. The cost of supporting additional languages or new language features in these models is very high. We present a novel approach to decompilation based on neural machine translation. The main idea is to automatically learn a decompiler from a given compiler. Given a compiler from a source language S to a target language T , our approach automatically trains a decompiler that can translate (decompile) T back to S . We used our framework to decompile both LLVM IR and x86 assembly to C code with high success rates. Using our LLVM and x86 instantiations, we were able to successfully decompile over 97% and 88% of our benchmarks respectively. },

In recent years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf\{19,448\} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \textbf\{19\} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation. },

However, current decompilation tools usually need lots of experts' efforts, even for years, to generate the rules for decompilation, which also requires long-term maintenance as the syntax of high-level PL or low-level PL changes. Also, an ideal decompiler should concisely generate high-level PL with similar functionality to the source low-level PL and semantic information (e.g., meaningful variable names), just like human-written code. Unfortunately, existing manually-defined rule-based decompilation techniques only functionally restore the low-level PL to a similar high-level PL and are still powerless to recover semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel neural decompilation approach to translate low-level PL into accurate and user-friendly high-level PL, effectively improving its readability and understandability. Furthermore, we implement the proposed approaches called SEAM. Evaluations on four real-world applications show that SEAM has an average accuracy of 94.41%, which is much better than prior neural machine translation (NMT) models.

We present BTD (Bin to DNN), a decompiler for deep neural network (DNN) executables. BTD takes DNN executables and outputs full model specifications, including types of DNN operators, network topology, dimensions, and parameters that are (nearly) identical to those of the input models. BTD delivers a practical framework to process DNN executables compiled by different DL compilers and with full optimizations enabled on x86 platforms. It employs learning-based techniques to infer DNN operators, dynamic analysis to reveal network architectures, and symbolic execution to facilitate inferring dimensions and parameters of DNN operators. Our evaluation reveals that BTD enables accurate recovery of full specifications of complex DNNs with millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet). The recovered DNN specifications can be re-compiled into a new DNN executable exhibiting identical behavior to the input executable. We show that BTD can boost two representative attacks, adversarial example generation and knowledge stealing, against DNN executables.

To address these issues, we develop the CodeInverter Suite, making three contributions: (1) the CodeInverter Workflow (CIW) is a novel prompt engineering workflow that incorporates control flow graphs (CFG) and explicit data mappings to improve LLM-based decompilation. (2) Using CIW on well-known source code datasets, we curate the CodeInverter Dataset (CID), a domain-specific dataset containing 8.69 million samples that contains CFGs and data mapping tables. (3) We train the CoderInverter Models (CIMs) on CID, generating two lightweight LLMs (with 1.3B and 6.7B parameters) intended for efficient inference in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the CIW substantially enhances the performance of various LLMs across multiple metrics.

A large body of existing work uses machine learning to predict missing names, types, and other abstractions in decompiled code. However, little of this work considers obfuscations : semantics-preserving transformations that obscure the functionality and design of a program. At the same time, obfuscations are common in practice, especially in malware. In this work, we perform a quantitative analysis of the impact that obfuscations have on decompiled code. Further, we investigate the degree to which training on obfuscated code mitigates the impact of obfuscations. We perform our experiments on three different models from the literature: DIRTY, HexT5, and VarBERT. We find that obfuscations do negatively impact machine learning models, but training on obfuscations can partially help recover lost accuracy.},

Also, an ideal decompiler should concisely generate high-level PL with similar functionality to the source low-level PL. In this paper, we propose a novel neural decompilation approach to translate low-level PL into accurate high-level PL. We design a transformer-based neural network model, including a data dependency-based masked self-attention scheme and an instruction embedding scheme that accurately learns the mapping rules between low-level PLs and high-level PLs. We also propose a new intermediate language representation to bridge the information asymmetry between high-level and low-level PL. Furthermore, we implement the proposed approach called ANDE . Evaluations of four real-world applications show that ANDE has an average accuracy of 94.41\%, much better than prior neural machine translation (NMT) models.},

  abstract = {Decompilation technology has long been a pivotal tool in the field of computer software reverse engineering. Traditional decompilation methods frequently result in code that is structurally incomplete, semantically incoherent, and of low readability. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their application to decompilation tasks, the field of decompilation research has witnessed notable advancements. Nevertheless, the performance of these models in decompiling C language programs on ARM platforms remains less than optimal. In this paper, we propose an inlined data processing algorithm to address the prevalent phenomenon of inlined data in ARM architecture, thereby enhancing the quality of the training dataset. Leveraging this, we have developed ARMQwen2, the first LLM that significantly improves the decompilation output quality of C programs on the ARM platform through fine-tuning techniques. We evaluate it under two test benchmarks and two different optimization levels, and the experimental results demonstrate that ARMQwen2 attains a re-executablility rate of up to 55\%, which is more than twice as high as Ghidra, the current state-of-the-art decompiler, and 20\% higher than the advanced large language model GPT-4o-mini. In terms of re-compilability and edit similarity, ARMQwen2 achieves an average of 90\% and 60\% respectively.},

  abstract = {Traditional decompilers utilize countless hardcoded rules written by subject matter experts, making them inflexible. Some recent systems address this using deep learning. The current consensus is that these systems have to include considerable domain knowledge and iterative heuristic components to solve parts of the decompilation problem, particularly the problem of predicting identifiers and literals. In this paper, we present a single-pass end-to-end neural decompilation system that utilizes copying mechanism . The copying mechanism is able to copy the literals and (offsets of) variables directly from the assembly code, in a single step , as part of the single forward pass through the model. Additionally, we take a further step toward decompiling real-world code by addressing important programming constructs like switch statements, function definitions, and function calls. We compile a dataset of real-world programming competition code and evaluate our model on it. The method achieves a program accuracy of 73\% on the hardest complexity level of our generated dataset and 51\% on the real-world examples without any additional error correction (EC) techniques, which surpasses the results of previous works without EC.},

  abstract = {Blockchain systems are increasingly targeted by on-chain attacks that exploit contract vulnerabilities to extract value rapidly and stealthily, making systematic analysis and reproduction highly challenging. In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact. },

  abstract = {In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations (IR) to improve code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic information and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and produces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation (NMT) approaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one can get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as sequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between similar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages. The consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of NMT, and stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy. Here we propose to augment code translation with IRs, specifically LLVM IR, with results on the C++, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon the state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number of correct translations by 11% on average, and up to 79% for the Java -> Rust pair with greedy decoding. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of Go and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on the problem of IR decompilation, generating programming source code from IR, and study using IRs as intermediary pivot for translation. },

Motivated by the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose LLM4Decompile, the first and largest open-source LLM series (1.3B to 33B) trained to decompile binary code. We optimize the LLM training process and introduce the LLM4Decompile-End models to decompile binary directly. The resulting models significantly outperform GPT-4o and Ghidra on the HumanEval and ExeBench benchmarks by over 100% in terms of re-executability rate. Additionally, we improve the standard refinement approach to fine-tune the LLM4Decompile-Ref models, enabling them to effectively refine the decompiled code from Ghidra and achieve a further 16.2% improvement over the LLM4Decompile-End. LLM4Decompile demonstrates the potential of LLMs to revolutionize binary code decompilation, delivering remarkable improvements in readability and executability while complementing conventional tools for optimal results.

However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLM decompilation technology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Decompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmark Decompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues. We further explore commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide a thorough assessment of the studied LLM decompilers and find that fine-tuning with Decompile-Bench causes a 20% improvement over previous benchmarks in terms of the re-executability rate.

  abstract = {A C decompiler converts an executable into source code. The recovered C source code, once re-compiled, is expected to produce an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. With over twenty years of development, C decompilers have been widely used in production to support reverse engineering applications. Despite the prosperous development of C decompilers, it is widely acknowledged that decompiler outputs are mainly used for human consumption, and are not suitable for automatic recompilation. Often, a substantial amount of manual effort is required to fix the decompiler outputs before they can be recompiled and executed properly. This paper is motived by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in comprehending dense corpus of natural language. To alleviate the tedious, costly and often error-prone manual effort in fixing decompiler outputs, we investigate the feasibility of using LLMs to augment decompiler outputs, thus delivering recompilable decompilation. Note that different from previous efforts that focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with higher readability (e.g., recovering type/variable names), we focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with recompilability, meaning to generate code that can be recompiled into an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. We conduct a pilot study to characterize the obstacles in recompiling the outputs of the de facto commercial C decompiler -- IDA-Pro. We then propose a two-step, hybrid approach to augmenting decompiler outputs with LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a set of popular C test cases, and show that our approach can deliver a high recompilation success rate to over 75% with moderate effort, whereas none of the IDA-Pro's original outputs can be recompiled. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations of our approach and promising future research directions. },

(PL) codes such as binary code or assembly code to obtain an equivalent
high-level PL. Decompilation plays a vital role in the cyberspace
security fields such as software vulnerability discovery and analysis,
malicious code detection and analysis, and software engineering fields
such as source code analysis, optimization, and cross-language
cross-operating system migration. Unfortunately, the existing
decompilers mainly rely on experts to write rules, which leads to
bottlenecks such as low scalability, development difficulties, and long
cycles. The generated high-level PL codes often violate the code writing
specifications. Further, their readability is still relatively low. The
problems mentioned above hinder the efficiency of advanced applications
(e.g., vulnerability discovery) based on decompiled high-level PL
codes.In this paper, we propose a decompilation approach based on the
attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) mechanism, which
converts low-level PL into high-level PL while acquiring legibility and
keeping functionally similar. To compensate for the information
asymmetry between the low-level and high-level PL, a translation method
based on basic operations of low-level PL is designed. This method
improves the generalization of the NMT model and captures the
translation rules between PLs more accurately and efficiently. Besides,
we implement a neural decompilation framework called Neutron. The
evaluation of two practical applications shows that Neutron's average
program accuracy is 96.96\%, which is better than the traditional NMT

  abstract = {From logical reasoning to mental simulation, biological and artificial
neural systems possess an incredible capacity for computation. Such
neural computers offer a fundamentally novel computing paradigm by
representing data continuously and processing information in a natively
parallel and distributed manner. To harness this computation, prior work
has developed extensive training techniques to understand existing
neural networks. However, the lack of a concrete and low-level machine
code for neural networks precludes us from taking full advantage of a
neural computing framework. Here we provide such a machine code along
with a programming framework by using a recurrent neural network-a
reservoir computer-to decompile, code and compile analogue computations.
By decompiling the reservoir's internal representation and dynamics into
an analytic basis of its inputs, we define a low-level neural machine
code that we use to program the reservoir to solve complex equations and
store chaotic dynamical systems as random-access memory. We further
provide a fully distributed neural implementation of software
virtualization and logical circuits, and even program a playable game of
pong inside of a reservoir computer. Importantly, all of these functions
are programmed without requiring any example data or sampling of state
space. Finally, we demonstrate that we can accurately decompile the
analytic, internal representations of a full-rank reservoir computer
that has been conventionally trained using data. Taken together, we
define an implementation of neural computation that can both decompile
computations from existing neural connectivity and compile distributed
programs as new connections.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a widely utilized technique in reverse engineering,
aimed at restoring binary code to human-readable high-level language
code. However, the readability of the output from traditional
decompilers is often poor. With advancements in language models, several
learning-based decompilation methods have emerged. Nevertheless, the
probabilistic nature of language models leads to outputs whose
correctness cannot be guaranteed, necessitating further analysis by
engineers to identify the corresponding functionality of the code.
Inspired by compiler toolchains, we propose a novel approach to enhance
the effectiveness of language models in decompilation tasks. Traditional
rule-based methods and learning-based techniques are fused together in
our approach, drawing insights from both paradigms. Specifically, we
present a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model called IRaDT tailored
to refine decompilation outputs at the intermediate representation
level. Through this hybridization, we aim to address the limitations of
existing methodologies and achieve more accurate and robust
decompilation. We construct a diverse decompilation dataset targeting IR
and evaluated IRaDT based on this dataset. The experimental results
indicate that IRaDT has the ability to improve the readability of IR
while ensuring its compileability, achieving a 74\% improvement compared
to RetDec and a 93\% improvement compared to ChatGPT.},

  abstract = {The goal of decompilation is to convert compiled low-level code (e.g.,
assembly code) back into high-level programming languages, enabling
analysis in scenarios where source code is unavailable. This task
supports various reverse engineering applications, such as vulnerability
identification, malware analysis, and legacy software migration. The
end-to-end decompilation method based on large language models (LLMs)
reduces reliance on additional tools and minimizes manual intervention
due to its inherent properties. However, previous end-to-end methods
often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control
flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it
challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these
issues, we propose the ReF Decompile method, which incorporates the
following innovations: (1) The Relabeling strategy replaces jump target
addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function
Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable
information from binary files. Experimental results on the
Humaneval-Decompile Benchmark demonstrate that ReF Decompile surpasses
comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of
61.43\%.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of binary vulnerabilities in the software supply chain
has become a critical security challenge. Existing vulnerability
detection approaches-including dynamic analysis, static analysis, and
decompilation-assisted analysis-all suffer from limitations such as
insufficient coverage, high false-positive and false-negative rates, or
poor compatibility. Although decompilation technology can serve as a
bridge connecting binary-code and source-code vulnerability detection
tools, current schemes suffer from inadequate semantic restoration
quality and lack of tool compatibility. To address these issues, this
paper proposes LLMVulDecompiler, a binary decompilation model based on
fine-tuned large language models designed to generate high-precision
decompiled code that integrates directly with source-code static
analysis tools. We construct a dedicated training and evaluation dataset
that covers multiple compiler optimization levels (e.g., O0-O3) and a
diverse set of program functionalities. We adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
strategy that involves first building foundational decompilation
capabilities, then enhancing vulnerability-specific features.
Additionally, we design a low-cost inference pipeline and establish
multi-dimensional evaluation criteria, including restoration similarity,
compilation success rate, and functional correctness. Experimental
results show that the model significantly outperforms baseline models in
terms of average edit distance, compilation success rate, and black-box
test pass rate on the HumanEval-C benchmark. In tests on 12 real-world
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) instances, the approach
achieved a detection accuracy of 91.7\%, with substantially reduced
false-positive and false-negative rates. This study demonstrates the
effectiveness of specialized fine-tuning of large language models for
binary decompilation and vulnerability detection, offering a new pathway
for binary security analysis.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have undergone rapid evolution and achieved remarkable results in recent times. OpenAI's ChatGPT, backed by GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, has gained instant popularity due to its strong capability across a wide range of tasks, including natural language tasks, coding, mathematics, and engaging conversations. However, the impacts and limits of such LLMs in system security domain are less explored. In this paper, we delve into the limits of LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) in seven software security applications including vulnerability detection/repair, debugging, debloating, decompilation, patching, root cause analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing. Our exploration reveals that ChatGPT not only excels at generating code, which is the conventional application of language models, but also demonstrates strong capability in understanding user-provided commands in natural languages, reasoning about control and data flows within programs, generating complex data structures, and even decompiling assembly code. Notably, GPT-4 showcases significant improvements over GPT-3.5 in most security tasks. Also, certain limitations of ChatGPT in security-related tasks are identified, such as its constrained ability to process long code contexts. },

@article{Xie2025,
  abstract = {Demonstrating quantum advantage using conventional quantum algorithms remains challenging on current noisy gate-based quantum computers. Automated quantum circuit synthesis via quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution, employing trainable parametric quantum circuits to alleviate this. The circuit ansatz in these solutions is often designed through reinforcement learning-based quantum architecture search when the domain knowledge of the problem and hardware are not effective. However, the interpretability of these synthesized circuits remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their scalability and applicability across diverse problem domains. This work addresses the challenge of explainability in quantum architecture search (QAS) by introducing a novel genetic programming-based decompiler framework for reverse-engineering high-level quantum algorithms from low-level circuit representations. The proposed approach, implemented in the open-source tool DeQompile, employs program synthesis techniques, including symbolic regression and abstract syntax tree manipulation, to distill interpretable Qiskit algorithms from quantum assembly language. Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating the decompiler with online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms. },

  abstract = {Decompilation aims to recover the source code form of a binary executable. It has many security applications, such as malware analysis, vulnerability detection, and code hardening. A prominent challenge in decompilation is to recover variable names. We propose a novel technique that leverages the strengths of generative models while mitigating model biases. We build a prototype, GenNm, from pre-trained generative models CodeGemma-2B, CodeLlama-7B, and CodeLlama-34B. We finetune GenNm on decompiled functions and teach models to leverage contextual information. GenNm includes names from callers and callees while querying a function, providing rich contextual information within the model's input token limitation. We mitigate model biases by aligning the output distribution of models with symbol preferences of developers. Our results show that GenNm improves the state-of-the-art name recovery precision by 5.6-11.4 percentage points on two commonly used datasets and improves the state-of-the-art by 32% (from 17.3% to 22.8%) in the most challenging setup where ground-truth variable names are not seen in the training dataset. },

@article{Zou2025,
  abstract = {As one of the key tools in many security tasks, decompilers reconstruct human-readable source code from binaries. Yet, despite recent advances, their outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and remain difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanced decompiler-LLM pipeline with a fine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: preserving accuracy while improving readability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality assessment system to score the decompiled source code from multiple aspects, and use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best output during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the quality of 68.2% of all the functions produced by the native decompiler. },
