  abstract = {When code is compiled, information is lost, including some of the structure of the original source code as well as local identifier names. Existing decompilers can reconstruct much of the original source code, but typically use meaningless placeholder variables for identifier names. Using variable names which are more natural in the given context can make the code much easier to interpret, despite the fact that variable names have no effect on the execution of the program. In theory, it is impossible to recover the original identifier names since that information has been lost. However, most code is natural: it is highly repetitive and predictable based on the context. In this paper we propose a technique that assigns variables meaningful names by taking advantage of this naturalness property. We consider decompiler output to be a noisy distortion of the original source code, where the original source code is transformed into the decompiler output. Using this noisy channel model, we apply standard statistical machine translation approaches to choose natural identifiers, combining a translation model trained on a parallel corpus with a language model trained on unmodified C code. We generate a large parallel corpus from 1.2 TB of C source code obtained from GitHub. Under the most conservative assumptions, our technique is still able to recover the original variable names up to 16.2% of the time, which represents a lower bound for performance.},

  abstract = {Energy efficiency is a non-functional requirement that developers must consider. This requirement is particularly relevant when building software for battery-operated devices like mobile ones: a long-lasting battery is an essential requirement for an enjoyable user experience. It has been shown that many mobile applications include inefficiencies that cause battery to be drained faster than necessary. Some of these inefficiencies result from software patterns that have been catalogued in the literature. The catalogues often provide more energy-efficient alternatives. While the related literature is vast, most approaches so far assume as a fundamental requirement that one has access to the source code of an application in order to be able to analyse it. This requirement makes independent energy analysis challenging, or even impossible, e.g. for a mobile user or, most significantly, an App Store trying to provide information on how efficient an application being submitted for publication is. Our work studies the viability of looking for known energy patterns in applications by decompiling them and analysing the resulting code. For this, we decompiled and analysed 236 open-source applications. We extended an existing tool to aid in this process, making it capable of seamlessly decompiling and analysing android applications. With the collected data, we performed a comparative analysis of the presence of energy patterns between the source code and the decompiled code. While further research is required to more assertively say if this type of static analysis is viable, our results point in a promising direction with 163 applications, approximately 69%, containing the same number of detected patterns in both source code and the release APK.},

It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks.},

Despite its advantages, Wasm's binary nature presents significant challenges for developers and researchers, particularly regarding readability when debugging or analyzing web applications. Therefore, effective decompilation becomes crucial. Unfortunately, traditional decompilers often struggle with producing readable outputs. While some large language model (LLM)-based decompilers have shown good compatibility with general binary files, they still face specific challenges when dealing with Wasm.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, WaDec, which is the first use of a fine-tuned LLM to interpret and decompile Wasm binary code into a higher-level, more comprehensible source code representation. The LLM was meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of wat-c code snippets, employing self-supervised learning techniques. This enables WaDec to effectively decompile not only complete wat functions but also finer-grained wat code snippets. Our experiments demonstrate that WaDec markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art tools, offering substantial improvements across several metrics. It achieves a code inflation rate of only 3.34%, a dramatic 97% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art's 116.94%. Unlike the output of baselines that cannot be directly compiled or executed, WaDec maintains a recompilability rate of 52.11%, a re-execution rate of 43.55%, and an output consistency of 27.15%. Additionally, it significantly exceeds state-of-the-art performance in AST edit distance similarity by 185%, cyclomatic complexity by 8%, and cosine similarity by 41%, achieving an average code similarity above 50%. In summary, WaDec enhances understanding of the code's structure and execution flow, facilitating automated code analysis, optimization, and security auditing.},

  abstract = {Much software, whether beneficent or malevolent, is distributed only as binaries, sans source code. Absent source code, understanding binaries' behavior can be quite challenging, especially when compiled under higher levels of compiler optimization. These optimizations can transform comprehensible, "natural" source constructions into something entirely unrecognizable. Reverse engineering binaries, especially those suspected of being malevolent or guilty of intellectual property theft, are important and time-consuming tasks. There is a great deal of interest in tools to "decompile" binaries back into more natural source code to aid reverse engineering. Decompilation involves several desirable steps, including recreating source-language constructions, variable names, and perhaps even comments. One central step in creating binaries is optimizing function calls, using steps such as inlining. Recovering these (possibly inlined) function calls from optimized binaries is an essential task that most state-of-the-art decompiler tools try to do but do not perform very well. In this paper, we evaluate a supervised learning approach to the problem of recovering optimized function calls. We leverage open-source software and develop an automated labeling scheme to generate a reasonably large dataset of binaries labeled with actual function usages. We augment this large but limited labeled dataset with a pre-training step, which learns the decompiled code statistics from a much larger unlabeled dataset. Thus augmented, our learned labeling model can be combined with an existing decompilation tool, Ghidra, to achieve substantially improved performance in function call recovery, especially at higher levels of optimization. },

  abstract = {Reverse engineering binaries is required to understand and analyse programs for which the source code is unavailable. Decompilers can transform the largely unreadable binaries into a more readable source code-like representation. However, reverse engineering is time-consuming, much of which is taken up by labelling the functions with semantic information. While the automated summarisation of decompiled code can help Reverse Engineers understand and analyse binaries, current work mainly focuses on summarising source code, and no suitable dataset exists for this task. In this work, we extend large pre-trained language models of source code to summarise decompiled binary functions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of input and data properties on the performance of such models. Our approach consists of two main components; the data and the model. We first build CAPYBARA, a dataset of 214K decompiled function-documentation pairs across various compiler optimisations. We extend CAPYBARA further by generating synthetic datasets and deduplicating the data. Next, we fine-tune the CodeT5 base model with CAPYBARA to create BinT5. BinT5 achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU-4 score of 60.83, 58.82, and 44.21 for summarising source, decompiled, and synthetically stripped decompiled code, respectively. This indicates that these models can be extended to decompiled binaries successfully. Finally, we found that the performance of BinT5 is not heavily dependent on the dataset size and compiler optimisation level. We recommend future research to further investigate transferring knowledge when working with less expressive input formats such as stripped binaries. },

However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. However, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect. This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompiler based on a sequence-to-sequence transformer trained over real-world code. We develop a novel tokenizer and exploit no-dropout training to produce high-quality code. We utilize type-inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code. We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 functions from ExeBench on two ISAs and at two optimizations levels. SLaDe is up to 6 times more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4 times more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both. },

Even though there exist methods that try to match source code with binary code to accelerate the reverse engineering process, most of them are designed to focus on one programming language. However, in real life, programs are developed using different programming languages depending on their requirements. Thus, cross-language binary-to-source code matching has recently gained more attention. Nonetheless, the existing approaches still struggle to have precise predictions due to the inherent difficulties when the problem of matching binary code and source code needs to be addressed across programming languages. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-language binary source code matching. We propose GraphBinMatch, an approach based on a graph neural network that learns the similarity between binary and source codes. We evaluate GraphBinMatch on several tasks, such as cross-language binary-to-source code matching and cross-language source-to-source matching. We also evaluate our approach performance on single-language binary-to-source code matching. Experimental results show that GraphBinMatch outperforms state-of-the-art significantly, with improvements as high as 15\% over the F1 score.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is widely used in reverse engineering to recover high-level language code from binary executables. While recent approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files. This limitation significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics from assembly code. To address this limitation, we propose \\saltm, a novel binary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared between binary and source code. The core idea of \\saltm is to abstract selected binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery. Given a binary function, \\saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree (\\salt) from assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language. It then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed \\salt to generate decompiled code. Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol recovery to improve readability and correctness. We compare \\saltm to three categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercial decompilers, and decompilation methods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP, Exebench). Our experimental results demonstrate that \\saltm is highly effective in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\\\% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with a 10.6\\\% improvement). The results further validate its robustness against four commonly used obfuscation techniques. Additionally, analyses of real-world software and a user study confirm that our decompiled output offers superior assistance to human analysts in comprehending binary functions.},

Unfortunately, the lack of semantic information like variable types makes comprehending binaries difficult.

Chen et al. implemented DIRTY, a Transformer-based Encoder-Decoder architecture capable of augmenting decompiled code with variable names and types by leveraging decompiler output tokens and variable size information. Chen et al. were able to demonstrate a substantial increase in name and type extraction accuracy on Hex-Rays decompiler outputs compared to existing static analysis and AI-based techniques. We extend the original DIRTY results by re-training the DIRTY model on a dataset produced by the open-source Ghidra decompiler. Although Chen et al. concluded that Ghidra was not a suitable decompiler candidate due to its difficulty in parsing and incorporating DWARF symbols during analysis, we demonstrate that straightforward parsing of variable data generated by Ghidra results in similar retyping performance. We hope this work inspires further interest and adoption of the Ghidra decompiler for use in research projects. },

While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code with prompt engineering. Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 73.33% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance, suggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs continue to advance. In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, improving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart contracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3 projects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD. MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education. It empowers users to easily and independently review and audit non-open-source smart contracts, fostering accountability and decentralization },

Particularly, constructor inlining--or worse exclusion--due to optimization render class inheritance recovery challenging. Further, while modern solutions such as MARX can successfully group classes within an inheritance sub-tree, they fail to establish directionality of inheritance, which is crucial for security-related applications (e.g. decompilation).

Binary-level defenses are dependent on full and precise recovery of class inheritance tree of a given program. While current solutions focus on recovering single and multiple inheritances from the binary, they are oblivious to virtual inheritance. Conventional wisdom among binary-level defenses is that virtual inheritance is uncommon and/or support for single and multiple inheritances provides implicit support for virtual inheritance. In this paper, we show neither to be true. Specifically, (1) we present an efficient technique to detect virtual inheritance in C++ binaries and show through a study that virtual inheritance can be found in non-negligible number (more than 10\% on Linux and 12.5\% on Windows) of real-world C++ programs including Mysql and libstdc++. (2) we show that failure to handle virtual inheritance introduces both false positives and false negatives in the hierarchy tree. These false positves and negatives either introduce attack surface when the hierarchy recovered is used to enforce CFI policies, or make the hierarchy difficult to understand when it is needed for program understanding (e.g., during decompilation). (3) We present a solution to recover virtual inheritance from COTS binaries. We recover a maximum of 95\% and 95.5\% (GCC -O0) and a minimum of 77.5\% and 73.8\% (Clang -O2) of virtual and intermediate bases respectively in the virtual inheritance tree. },

Consequently, the decompilation process, which aims at producing source code from bytecode, must establish some strategies to reconstruct the information that has been lost. Modern Java decompilers tend to use distinct strategies to achieve proper decompilation. In this work, we hypothesize that the diverse ways in which bytecode can be decompiled has a direct impact on the quality of the source code produced by decompilers. We study the effectiveness of eight Java decompilers with respect to three quality indicators: syntactic correctness, syntactic distortion and semantic equivalence modulo inputs. This study relies on a benchmark set of 14 real-world open-source software projects to be decompiled (2041 classes in total). Our results show that no single modern decompiler is able to correctly handle the variety of bytecode structures coming from real-world programs. Even the highest ranking decompiler in this study produces syntactically correct output for 84% of classes of our dataset and semantically equivalent code output for 78% of classes. },

Decompiled Android malware code presents unique challenges for analysis, due to the malicious logic being buried within a large number of functions and the frequent lack of meaningful function names. This paper presents CAMA, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis. CAMA specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics (consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance), enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use CAMA to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis. },

Major new decompilers appear nearly every year and attain popularity, for a multitude of reverse-engineering or tool-building purposes. Technically, the problem is fundamental: it consists of recovering high-level control flow from a highly-optimized continuation-passing-style (CPS) representation. Architecturally, decompilers can be built using either static analysis or symbolic execution techniques. We present Shrknr, a static-analysis-based decompiler succeeding the state-of-the-art Elipmoc decompiler. Shrknr manages to achieve drastic improvements relative to the state of the art, in all significant dimensions: scalability, completeness, precision. Chief among the techniques employed is a new variant of static analysis context: shrinking context sensitivity. Shrinking context sensitivity performs deep cuts in the static analysis context, eagerly "forgetting" control-flow history, in order to leave room for further precise reasoning. We compare Shrnkr to state-of-the-art decompilers, both static-analysis- and symbolic-execution-based. In a standard benchmark set, Shrnkr scales to over 99.5% of contracts (compared to ~95%), covers (i.e., reaches and manages to decompile) 67% more code, and reduces key imprecision metrics by over 65%. },

However, less than 1% of deployed smart contracts are open-source, and it is difficult for users to understand the functionality and internal mechanism of those closed-source contracts. Although a few decompilers for smart contracts have been recently proposed, it is still not easy for users to grasp the semantic information of the contract, not to mention the potential misleading due to decompilation errors. In this paper, we propose the first system named STAN to generate descriptions for the bytecodes of smart contracts to help users comprehend them. In particular, for each interface in a smart contract, STAN can generate four categories of descriptions, including functionality description, usage description, behavior description, and payment description, by leveraging symbolic execution and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. Extensive experiments show that STAN can generate adequate, accurate, and readable descriptions for contract's bytecodes, which have practical value for users. },

  abstract = {Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate method identification, incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis (SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically, \system\{\} constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification. Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart contract methods shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g., Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o with SmartHalo further enhances its performance, achieving precision rates of 87.39% for method boundaries, 90.39% for variable types, and 80.65% for contract attributes. },

SMT solvers, which serve as a foundation for these tools, have thus increased support for bitvector reasoning through bit-blasting and linear arithmetic approximations. In this paper we show that similar linear arithmetic approximation of bitvector operations can be done at the source level through transformations. Specifically, we introduce new paths that over-approximate bitvector operations with linear conditions/constraints, increasing branching but allowing us to better exploit the well-developed integer reasoning and interpolation of verification tools. We show that, for reachability of bitvector programs, increased branching incurs negligible overhead yet, when combined with integer interpolation optimizations, enables more programs to be verified. We further show this exploitation of integer interpolation in the common case also enables competitive termination verification of bitvector programs and leads to the first effective technique for LTL verification of bitvector programs. Finally, we provide an in-depth case study of decompiled ("lifted") binary programs, which emulate X86 execution through frequent use of bitvector operations. We present a new tool DarkSea, the first tool capable of verifying reachability, termination, and LTL of lifted binaries. },

  abstract = {Vulnerabilities are challenging to locate and repair, especially when source code is unavailable and binary patching is required. Manual methods are time-consuming, require significant expertise, and do not scale to the rate at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. Automated methods are an attractive alternative, and we propose Partially Recompilable Decompilation (PRD). PRD lifts suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level techniques. Although decompilation and recompilation do not typically work on an entire binary, our approach succeeds because it is limited to a few functions, like those identified by our binary fault localization. We evaluate these assumptions and find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, 70-89% of individual functions are successfully decompiled and recompiled with sufficient type recovery. In comparison, only 1.7% of the full C-binaries succeed. When decompilation succeeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 92.9% of the time. In addition, we evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating only on binaries, performs as well as, and sometimes better than full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a success rate consistent with these same tools operating with access to the entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those produced by top CGC teams. For generality, our evaluation includes two independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world binaries. },

Despite its advantages, Wasm's binary nature presents significant challenges for developers and researchers, particularly regarding readability when debugging or analyzing web applications. Therefore, effective decompilation becomes crucial. Unfortunately, traditional decompilers often struggle with producing readable outputs. While some large language model (LLM)-based decompilers have shown good compatibility with general binary files, they still face specific challenges when dealing with Wasm. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, WaDec, which is the first use of a fine-tuned LLM to interpret and decompile Wasm binary code into a higher-level, more comprehensible source code representation. The LLM was meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of wat-c code snippets, employing self-supervised learning techniques. This enables WaDec to effectively decompile not only complete wat functions but also finer-grained wat code snippets. Our experiments demonstrate that WaDec markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art tools, offering substantial improvements across several metrics. It achieves a code inflation rate of only 3.34%, a dramatic 97% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art's 116.94%. Unlike baselines' output that cannot be directly compiled or executed, WaDec maintains a recompilability rate of 52.11%, a re-execution rate of 43.55%, and an output consistency of 27.15%.

Each graph is viewed probabilistically as a Markov chain where each node represents a code block of the corresponding function, and by computing the PageRank vector (Perron vector with transport), a probability measure can be defined over the nodes of the given graph. Each graph is vectorized by computing Lebesgue antiderivatives of hand-engineered functions defined on the vertex set of the given graph against the PageRank measure. Files are subsequently vectorized by aggregating the set of vectors corresponding to the set of graphs resulting from decompiling the given file. The result is a fast, intuitive, and easy-to-compute glass-box vectorization scheme, which can be leveraged for training a standalone classifier or to augment an existing feature space. We refer to this vectorization technique as PageRank Measure Integration Vectorization (PMIV).

First step is a process of decompilation of JVM and its translation to internal abstract syntax tree, the dependency extraction and memory analysis is performed. Finally, the mapping process is performed which consists of a set of rules responsible for translating the input virtual machine source code to its parallel version. The main novelty is that it can deal with pure Java virtual machine and can generate parallel code for multicore processors.

Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but offer little semantic insight. This paper proposes the REMaQE automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or pointers, and can reverse engineer object-oriented implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool "tmon". To evaluate REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations.

A salient property of our approach is that it first generically considers what proof obligations a generic abstract domain for pointer analysis must satisfy. This allows easy instantiation of different domains, varying in precision, while preserving the correctness of the analysis. In the trade-off between scalability and precision, such customization allows "meaningful" precision (sufficiently precise to ensure basic sanity properties, such as that relevant parts of the stack frame are not overwritten during function execution) while also allowing coarse analysis when pointer computations have become too obfuscated during compilation for sound and accurate bounds analysis. We experiment with three different abstract domains with high, medium, and low precision. Evaluation shows that our approach is able to derive designations for memory writes soundly in COTS binaries, in a context-sensitive interprocedural fashion. },

  abstract = {WebAssembly is a low-level bytecode language designed for client-side execution in web browsers. The need for decompilation techniques that recover high-level source code from WASM binaries has grown as WASM continues to gain widespread adoption and its security concerns. However little research has been done to assess the quality of decompiled code from WASM. This paper aims to fill this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis between decompiled C code from WASM binaries and state-of-the-art native binary decompilers. We presented a novel framework for empirically evaluating C-based decompilers from various aspects including correctness/ readability/ and structural similarity. The proposed metrics are validated practicality in decompiler assessment and provided insightful observations regarding the characteristics and constraints of existing decompiled code. This in turn contributes to bolstering the security and reliability of software systems that rely on WASM and native binaries. },

  abstract = {With the rapid advancement of Internet technology, the threat of malware to computer systems and network security has intensified. Malware affects individual privacy and security and poses risks to critical infrastructures of enterprises and nations. The increasing quantity and complexity of malware, along with its concealment and diversity, challenge traditional detection techniques. Static detection methods struggle against variants and packed malware, while dynamic methods face high costs and risks that limit their application. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel and efficient malware detection techniques to improve accuracy and robustness. This study first employs the minhash algorithm to convert binary files of malware into grayscale images, followed by the extraction of global and local texture features using GIST and LBP algorithms. Additionally, the study utilizes IDA Pro to decompile and extract opcode sequences, applying N-gram and tf-idf algorithms for feature vectorization. The fusion of these features enables the model to comprehensively capture the behavioral characteristics of malware. In terms of model construction, a CNN-BiLSTM fusion model is designed to simultaneously process image features and opcode sequences, enhancing classification performance. Experimental validation on multiple public datasets demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms traditional detection techniques in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score, particularly in detecting variants and obfuscated malware with greater stability. The research presented in this paper offers new insights into the development of malware detection technologies, validating the effectiveness of feature and model fusion, and holds promising application prospects. },

@article{Zhang2025,
  abstract = {Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT) provides a sound and complete framework to reason about trace equivalence between simple imperative programs. However, there are still several notable limitations. First, GKAT is completely agnostic with respect to the meaning of primitives, to keep equivalence decidable. Second, GKAT excludes non-local control flow such as goto, break, and return. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Control-Flow GKAT (CF-GKAT), a system that allows reasoning about programs that include non-local control flow as well as hardcoded values. CF-GKAT is able to soundly and completely verify trace equivalence of a larger class of programs, while preserving the nearly-linear efficiency of GKAT. This makes CF-GKAT suitable for the verification of control-flow manipulating procedures, such as decompilation and goto-elimination. To demonstrate CF-GKAT's abilities, we validated the output of several highly non-trivial program transformations, such as Erosa and Hendren's goto-elimination procedure and the output of Ghidra decompiler. CF-GKAT opens up the application of Kleene Algebra to a wider set of challenges, and provides an important verification tool that can be applied to the field of decompilation and control-flow transformation. },
