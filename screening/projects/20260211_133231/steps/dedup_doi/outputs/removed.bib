  abstract = {Decompilation is a well-studied area with numerous high-quality tools available. These are frequently used for security tasks and to port legacy code. However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. Nevertheless, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect.This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompiler based on a sequence-to-sequence Transformer trained over real-world code and augmented with a type inference engine. We utilize a novel tokenizer, dropout-free regularization, and type inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code.We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 ExeBench functions on two ISAs and at two optimization levels. SLaDe is up to 6\texttimes{} more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4\texttimes{} more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both.},

  abstract = {The rise of smart contracts---autonomous applications running on blockchains---has led to a growing number of threats, necessitating sophisticated program analysis. However, smart contracts, which transact valuable tokens and cryptocurrencies, are compiled to very low-level bytecode. This bytecode is the ultimate semantics and means of enforcement of the contract.We present the Gigahorse toolchain. At its core is a reverse compiler (i.e., a decompiler) that decompiles smart contracts from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into a high-level 3-address code representation. The new intermediate representation of smart contracts makes implicit data- and control-flow dependencies of the EVM bytecode explicit. Decompilation obviates the need for a contract's source and allows the analysis of both new and deployed contracts.Gigahorse advances the state of the art on several fronts. It gives the highest analysis precision and completeness among decompilers for Ethereum smart contracts---e.g., Gigahorse can decompile over 99.98% of deployed contracts, compared to 88% for the recently-published Vandal decompiler and under 50% for the state-of-the-practice Porosity decompiler. Importantly, Gigahorse offers a full-featured toolchain for further analyses (and a "batteries included" approach, with multiple clients already implemented), together with the highest performance and scalability. Key to these improvements is Gigahorse's use of a declarative, logic-based specification, which allows high-level insights to inform low-level decompilation.},

In various such contexts, it is crucial that the result is trustworthy, i.e., it can be formally established that the pointer designations are overapproximative. This paper presents an approach to formally proven correct binary-level pointer analysis. A salient property of our approach is that it first generically considers what proof obligations a generic abstract domain for pointer analysis must satisfy. This allows easy instantiation of different domains, varying in precision, while preserving the correctness of the analysis. In the tradeoff between scalability and precision, such customization allows "meaningful" precision (sufficiently precise to ensure basic sanity properties, such as that relevant parts of the stack frame are not overwritten during function execution) while also allowing coarse analysis when pointer computations have become too obfuscated during compilation for sound and accurate bounds analysis. We experiment with three different abstract domains with high, medium, and low precision. Evaluation shows that our approach is able to derive designations for memory writes soundly in COTS binaries, in a context-sensitive interprocedural fashion.},

Pirated applications on Android app stores are harming developers and their users by clone scammers. The scammers usually generate pirated versions of the same applications and publish them in different open-source app stores. There is no centralized system between these app stores to prevent scammers from publishing pirated applications. As most of the app stores are hosted on cloud storage, therefore a cloud-based interaction system can prevent scammers from publishing pirated applications. In this paper, we proposed IoT-based cloud architecture for clone detection using program dependency analysis. First, the newly submitted APK and possible original files are selected from app stores. The APK Extractor and JDEX decompiler extract APK and DEX files for Java source code analysis. The dependency graphs of Java files are generated to extract a set of weighted features. The Stacked-Long Short-Term Memory (S-LSTM) deep learning model is designed to predict possible clones.Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach can achieve an average accuracy of 95.48% among clones from different application stores.},

It is also useful for security researchers and reverse engineers since it enables high fidelity reasoning about the binary code such as revealing the functionality, authorship, libraries used, and vulnerabilities. Numerous studies have investigated binary code with the goal of extracting fingerprints that can illuminate the semantics of a target application. However, extracting fingerprints is a challenging task since a substantial amount of significant information will be lost during compilation, notably, variable and function naming, the original data and control flow structures, comments, semantic information, and the code layout. This article provides the first systematic review of existing binary code fingerprinting approaches and the contexts in which they are used. In addition, it discusses the applications that rely on binary code fingerprints, the information that can be captured during the fingerprinting process, and the approaches used and their implementations. It also addresses limitations and open questions related to the fingerprinting process and proposes future directions.},

  abstract = {Lifting binaries to a higher-level representation is an essential step for decompilation, binary verification, patching and security analysis. In this paper, we present the first approach to provably overapproximative x86-64 binary lifting. A stripped binary is verified for certain sanity properties such as return address integrity and calling convention adherence. Establishing these properties allows the binary to be lifted to a representation that contains an overapproximation of all possible execution paths of the binary. The lifted representation contains disassembled instructions, reconstructed control flow, invariants and proof obligations that are sufficient to prove the sanity properties as well as correctness of the lifted representation. We apply this approach to Linux Foundation and Intel’s Xen Hypervisor covering about 400K instructions. This demonstrates our approach is the first approach to provably overapproximative binary lifting scalable to commercial off-the-shelf systems. The lifted representation is exportable to the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover, allowing formal verification of its correctness. If our technique succeeds and the proofs obligations are proven true, then – under the generated assumptions – the lifted representation is correct.},

Nevertheless, the process of compilation and stripping irreversibly discards high-level semantic information that is crucial to code comprehension, such as comments, identifier names, and types. Existing approaches typically recover only one type of information, making them suboptimal for semantic inference. In this paper, we treat pseudo-code as a special programming language, then present a unified pre-trained model, HexT5, that is trained on vast amounts of natural language comments, source identifiers, and pseudo-code using novel pseudo-code-based pre-training objectives. We fine-tune HexT5 on various downstream tasks, including code summarization, variable name recovery, function name recovery, and similarity detection. Comprehensive experiments show that HexT5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on four downstream tasks, and it demonstrates the robust effectiveness and generalizability of HexT5 for binary-related tasks.},

Using them, people are able to access the world of Internet and connect with their friends, their colleagues at work or even unknown people with common interests. This proliferation of the mobile devices has also been seen as an opportunity for the cyber criminals to deceive smartphone users and steel their money directly or indirectly, respectively, by accessing their bank accounts through the smartphones or by blackmailing them or selling their private data such as photos, credit card data, etc. to third parties. This is usually achieved by installing malware to smartphones masking their malevolent payload as a legitimate application and advertise it to the users with the hope that mobile users will install it in their devices. Thus, any existing application can easily be modified by integrating a malware and then presented it as a legitimate one. In response to this, scientists have proposed a number of malware detection and classification methods using a variety of techniques. Even though, several of them achieve relatively high precision in malware classification, there is still space for improvement. In this paper, we propose a text mining all repeated pattern detection method which uses the decompiled files of an application in order to classify a suspicious application into one of the known malware families. Based on the experimental results using a real malware dataset, the methodology tries to correctly classify (without any misclassification) all randomly selected malware applications of 3 categories with 3 different families each.},

Often, the code is not copied as it is and it may be modified for various purposes; e.g. refactoring, bug fixing, or even software plagiarism. These code modifications could affect the performance of code similarity analysers including code clone and plagiarism detectors to some certain degree. We are interested in two types of code modification in this study: pervasive modifications, i.e. transformations that may have a global effect, and local modifications, i.e. code changes that are contained in a single method or code block. We evaluate 30 code similarity detection techniques and tools using five experimental scenarios for Java source code. These are (1) pervasively modified code, created with tools for source code and bytecode obfuscation, and boiler-plate code, (2) source code normalisation through compilation and decompilation using different decompilers, (3) reuse of optimal configurations over different data sets, (4) tool evaluation using ranked-based measures, and (5) local + global code modifications. Our experimental results show that in the presence of pervasive modifications, some of the general textual similarity measures can offer similar performance to specialised code similarity tools, whilst in the presence of boiler-plate code, highly specialised source code similarity detection techniques and tools outperform textual similarity measures. Our study strongly validates the use of compilation/decompilation as a normalisation technique. Its use reduced false classifications to zero for three of the tools. Moreover, we demonstrate that optimal configurations are very sensitive to a specific data set. After directly applying optimal configurations derived from one data set to another, the tools perform poorly on the new data set. The code similarity analysers are thoroughly evaluated not only based on several well-known pair-based and query-based error measures but also on each specific type of pervasive code modification. This broad, thorough study is the largest in existence and potentially an invaluable guide for future users of similarity detection in source code.},

  abstract = {Abstract Decompilers are indispensable tools in Android malware analysis and app security auditing. Numerous academic works also employ an Android decompiler as the first step in a program analysis pipeline. In such settings, decompilation is frequently regarded as a “solved” problem, in that it is simply expected that source code can be accurately recovered from an app. On the other hand, it is known that, e.g, obfuscation can negatively impact a decompiler’s effectiveness. Therefore, in order to better understand potential failure modes of, e.g., automated analysis pipelines involving decompilation, it is important to characterize the performance of decompilers on both benign and malicious apps. To this end, we have performed what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first large-scale study of Android decompilation failure rates, using three sets of apps; namely, 3,018 open-source apps, 13,601 apps crawled from Google Play, and an existing collection of 24,553 malware samples. In addition to the state-of-the-art Dalvik bytecode decompiler Jadx, we also studied the performance of three popular Java decompilers. Furthermore, this paper also presents the findings from a follow-up study on 54,945 malware apps, where we additionally performed an analysis of the reasons for decompilation failures. Our study revealed that decompilers generally have very low failure rates, and that few failures on benign apps appear to be related to obfuscation. On malware, however, obfuscation appears to be a more prominent cause of failures, although the vast majority of malicious apps could still be fully decompiled by an ensemble of decompilers.},

  abstract = {Malware detection is an important task in software maintenance. It can effectively protect user information from the attack of malicious developers. Existing studies mainly focus on leveraging permission information and API call information to identify malware. However, many studies pay attention to the API call without considering the role of API call sequences. In this study, we propose a new method by combining both the permission information and the API call sequence information to distinguish malicious applications from benign applications. First, we extract features of permission and API call sequence with a decompiling tool. Then, one-hot encoding and Word2Vec are adopted to represent the permission feature and the API call sequence feature for each application, respectively. Based on this, we leverage Random Forest (RF) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to train a permission-based classifier and an API call sequence-based classifier, respectively. Finally, we design a linear strategy to combine the outputs of these two classifiers to predict the labels of newly arrived applications. By an evaluation with 15,198 malicious applications and 15,129 benign applications, our approach achieves 98.84\% in terms of precision, 98.17\% in terms of recall, 98.50\% in terms of F1-score, and 98.52\% in terms of accuracy on average, and outperforms the state-of-art method Malscan by 2.12\%, 0.27\%, 1.20\%, and 1.24\%, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate that the method combining two features achieves better performance than the methods based on a single feature.},

  abstract = {Software defect prediction locates defective code to help developers improve the security of software. However, existing studies on software defect prediction are mostly limited to the source code. Defect prediction for Android binary executables (called apks) has never been explored in previous studies. In this paper, we propose an explorative study of defect prediction in Android apks. We first propose smali2vec, a new approach to generate features that capture the characteristics of smali (decompiled files of apks) files in apks. Smali2vec extracts both token and semantic features of the defective files in apks and such comprehensive features are needed for building accurate prediction models. Then we leverage deep neural network (DNN), which is one of the most common architecture of deep learning networks, to train and build the defect prediction model in order to achieve accuracy. We apply our defect prediction model to more than 90,000 smali files from 50 Android apks and the results show that our model could achieve an AUC (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of 85.98\% and it is capable of predicting defects in apks. Furthermore, the DNN is proved to have a better performance than the traditional shallow machine learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machine and naive bayes) used in previous studies. The model has been used in our practical work and helped locate many defective files in apks.},

  abstract = {Abstract Reverse engineering complex proprietary software is a tedious and time consuming task. A fair amount of the overall effort is usually devoted to locating those software components which are responsible for the functionality of interest (e.g., a proprietary encryption algorithm). To aid this process, several tools, available in the public domain, can be used, implementing sophisticated algorithms for control-flow recovery, stack frame recovery, data type inference, decompilation etc. However, the important problem of decomposing a binary executable to its constituent object files (or compile-units) has not been, in our opinion, sufficiently studied. In this paper we present novel techniques for estimating the number, as well as the boundaries, of compile-units in binary executables. We present algorithms which recover information that improves the precision degree in reverse engineering tasks. In addition, our algorithms can be used to reduce the effort of locating, recovering and understanding specific functionalities of closed-source software. We evaluate our algorithms on the public DeepBinDiff ELF dataset, consisting of \$\$\\approx\$\$ 2000 binaries, as well as two larger executables of GNU GDB, built for ARM and AArch64 and show that they consistently approach the ground-truth, with an average recovery precision close to 75\%. Furthermore, we show how our research can aid in binary diffing applications, by comparing the recovered compile-unit structure of a pair of Microsoft Windows kernel images. We make our prototype implementation, written in Python and named REcover , publicly available for further evaluation by the reverse engineering community.},

  abstract = {The protection and privacy of the 5G-IoT framework is a major challenge due to the vast number of mobile devices. Specialized applications running these 5G-IoT systems may be vulnerable to clone attacks. Cloning applications can be achieved by stealing or distributing commercial Android apps to harm the advanced services of the 5G-IoT framework. Meanwhile, most Android app stores run and manage Android apps that developers have submitted separately without any central verification systems. Android scammers sell pirated versions of commercial software to other app stores under different names. Android applications are typically stored on cloud servers, while API access services may be used to detect and prevent cloned applications from being released. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid approach to the Control Flow Graph (CFG) and a deep learning model to secure the smart services of the 5G-IoT framework. First, the newly submitted APK file is extracted and the JDEX decompiler is used to retrieve Java source files from possibly original and cloned applications. Second, the source files are broken down into various android-based components. After generating Control-Flow Graphs (CFGs), the weighted features are stripped from each component. Finally, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is designed to predict potential cloned applications by training features from different components of android applications. Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach can achieve an average accuracy of 96.24\% for cloned applications selected from different android application stores.},

  abstract = {Abstract From logical reasoning to mental simulation, biological and artificial neural systems possess an incredible capacity for computation. Such neural computers offer a fundamentally novel computing paradigm by representing data continuously and processing information in a natively parallel and distributed manner. To harness this computation, prior work has developed extensive training techniques to understand existing neural networks. However, the lack of a concrete and low-level machine code for neural networks precludes us from taking full advantage of a neural computing framework. Here we provide such a machine code along with a programming framework by using a recurrent neural network—a reservoir computer—to decompile, code and compile analogue computations. By decompiling the reservoir’s internal representation and dynamics into an analytic basis of its inputs, we define a low-level neural machine code that we use to program the reservoir to solve complex equations and store chaotic dynamical systems as random-access memory. We further provide a fully distributed neural implementation of software virtualization and logical circuits, and even program a playable game of pong inside of a reservoir computer. Importantly, all of these functions are programmed without requiring any example data or sampling of state space. Finally, we demonstrate that we can accurately decompile the analytic, internal representations of a full-rank reservoir computer that has been conventionally trained using data. Taken together, we define an implementation of neural computation that can both decompile computations from existing neural connectivity and compile distributed programs as new connections.},

  abstract = {Abstract Decompilation aims to analyze and transform low-level program language (PL) codes such as binary code or assembly code to obtain an equivalent high-level PL. Decompilation plays a vital role in the cyberspace security fields such as software vulnerability discovery and analysis, malicious code detection and analysis, and software engineering fields such as source code analysis, optimization, and cross-language cross-operating system migration. Unfortunately, the existing decompilers mainly rely on experts to write rules, which leads to bottlenecks such as low scalability, development difficulties, and long cycles. The generated high-level PL codes often violate the code writing specifications. Further, their readability is still relatively low. The problems mentioned above hinder the efficiency of advanced applications (e.g., vulnerability discovery) based on decompiled high-level PL codes.In this paper, we propose a decompilation approach based on the attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) mechanism, which converts low-level PL into high-level PL while acquiring legibility and keeping functionally similar. To compensate for the information asymmetry between the low-level and high-level PL, a translation method based on basic operations of low-level PL is designed. This method improves the generalization of the NMT model and captures the translation rules between PLs more accurately and efficiently. Besides, we implement a neural decompilation framework called Neutron. The evaluation of two practical applications shows that Neutron’s average program accuracy is 96.96\%, which is better than the traditional NMT model.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach for predicting program properties from large
codebases (aka ``Big Code{''}). Our approach learns a probabilistic
model from ``Big Code{''} and uses this model to predict properties of
new, unseen programs.
The key idea of our work is to transform the program into a
representation that allows us to formulate the problem of inferring
program properties as structured prediction in machine learning. This
enables us to leverage powerful probabilistic models such as Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) and perform joint prediction of program properties.
As an example of our approach, we built a scalable prediction engine
called JSNICE for solving two kinds of tasks in the context of
JavaScript: predicting (syntactic) names of identifiers and predicting
(semantic) type annotations of variables. Experimentally, JSNICE
predicts correct names for 63\% of name identifiers and its type
annotation predictions are correct in 81\% of cases. Since its public
release at http://jsnice.org, JSNice has become a popular system with
hundreds of thousands of uses.
By formulating the problem of inferring program properties as structured
prediction, our work opens up the possibility for a range of new ``Big
Code{''} applications such as de-obfuscators, decompilers, invariant
generators, and others.},

  abstract = {Traditional machine learning based malware detection methods often use
decompiling techniques or dynamic monitoring techniques to extract the
feature representation of malware. This procedure is time consuming and
strongly depends on the skills of experts. In addition, malware can be
packed or encrypted to evade the analysis of decompiling tools. To solve
this issue, we propose a static detection method based on deep learning.
We directly extract bytecode file from Android APK file, and convert the
bytecode file into a two-dimensional bytecode matrix, then use the deep
learning algorithm, convolution neural network (CNN), to train a
detection model and apply it to classify malware. CNN can automatically
learn features of bytecode file which can be used to recognize malware.
The proposed detection model avoids the procedure for analyzing malware
features and designing the feature representation of malware. The
experimental results show the proposed method is effective to detect
malware, especially malware encrypted using polymorphic techniques.},

  abstract = {Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as an ecosystem
for smart contracts: full-fledged intercommunicating programs that
capture the transaction logic of an account. A gas limit caps the
execution of an Ethereum smart contract: instructions, when executed,
consume gas, and the execution proceeds as long as gas is available.
Gas-focused vulnerabilities permit an attacker to force key contract
functionality to run out of gas-effectively performing a permanent
denial-of-service attack on the contract. Such vulnerabilities are among
the hardest for programmers to protect against, as out-of-gas behavior
may be uncommon in nonattack scenarios and reasoning about these
vulnerabilities is nontrivial.
In this paper, we identify gas-focused vulnerabilities and present
MadMax: a static program analysis technique that automatically detects
gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. MadMax combines a
smart contract decompiler and semantic queries in Datalog. Our approach
captures high-level program modeling concepts (such as ``dynamic data
structure storage{''} and ``safely resumable loops{''}) and delivers
high precision and scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart
contracts in the Ethereum blockchain in just 10 hours and flags
vulnerabilities in contracts with a monetary value in billions of
dollars. Manual inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that
81\% of the sampled warnings do indeed lead to vulnerabilities.},

  abstract = {Callbacks are an effective programming discipline for implementing
event-driven programming, especially in environments like Ethereum which
forbid shared global state and concurrency. Callbacks allow a callee to
delegate the execution back to the caller. Though effective, they can
lead to subtle mistakes principally in open environments where callbacks
can be added in a new code. Indeed, several high profile bugs in smart
contracts exploit callbacks. We present the first static technique
ensuring modularity in the presence of callbacks and apply it to verify
prominent smart contracts. Modularity ensures that external calls to
other contracts cannot affect the behavior of the contract. Importantly,
modularity is guaranteed without restricting programming.
In general, checking modularity is undecidable -even for programs
without loops. This paper describes an effective technique for soundly
ensuring modularity harnessing SMT solvers. The main idea is to define a
constructive version of modularity using commutativity and projection
operations on program segments. We believe that this approach is also
accessible to programmers, since counterexamples to modularity can be
generated automatically by the SMT solvers, allowing programmers to
understand and fix the error.
We implemented our approach in order to demonstrate the precision of the
modularity analysis and applied it to real smart contracts, including a
subset of the 150 most active contracts in Ethereum. Our implementation
decompiles bytecode programs into an intermediate representation and
then implements the modularity checking using SMT queries. Overall, we
argue that our experimental results indicate that the method can be
applied to many realistic contracts, and that it is able to prove
modularity where other methods fail.},

  abstract = {Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain greatly benefit from
cutting-edge analysis techniques and pose significant challenges. A
primary challenge is the extremely low-level representation of deployed
contracts. We present Elipmoc, a decompiler for the next generation of
smart contract analyses. Elipmoc is an evolution of Gigahorse, the top
research decompiler, dramatically improving over it and over other
state-of-the-art tools, by employing several high-precision techniques
and making them scalable. Among these techniques are a new kind of
context sensitivity (termed ``transactional sensitivity{''}) that
provides a more effective static abstraction of distinct dynamic
executions; a path-sensitive (yet scalable, through path merging)
algorithm for inference of function arguments and returns; and a fully
context sensitive private function reconstruction process. As a result,
smart contract security analyses and reverse-engineering tools built on
top of Elipmoc achieve high scalability, precision and completeness.
Elipmoc improves over all notable past decompilers, including its
predecessor, Gigahorse, and the stateof-the-art industrial tool,
Panoramix, integrated into the primary Ethereum blockchain explorer,
Etherscan. Elipmoc produces decompiled contracts with fully resolved
operands at a rate of 99.5\% (compared to 62.8\% for Gigahorse), and
achieves much higher completeness in code decornpilation than
Panoramix-e.g., up to 67\% more coverage of external call
statements-while being over 5x faster. Elipmoc has been the enabler for
recent (independent) discoveries of several exploitable vulnerabilities
on popular protocols, over funds in the many millions of dollars.},

  abstract = {Much software, whether beneficent or malevolent, is distributed only as
binaries, sans source code. Absent source code, understanding binaries'
behavior can be quite challenging, especially when compiled under higher
levels of compiler optimization. These optimizations can transform
comprehensible, ``natural{''} source constructions into something
entirely unrecognizable. Reverse engineering binaries, especially those
suspected of being malevolent or guilty of intellectual property theft,
are important and time-consuming tasks. There is a great deal of
interest in tools to ``decompile{''} binaries back into more natural
source code to aid reverse engineering. Decompilation involves several
desirable steps, including recreating source-language constructions,
variable names, and perhaps even comments. One central step in creating
binaries is optimizing function calls, using steps such as inlining.
Recovering these (possibly inlined) function calls from optimized
binaries is an essential task that most state-of-the-art decompiler
tools try to do but do not perform very well. In this paper, we evaluate
a supervised learning approach to the problem of recovering optimized
function calls. We leverage open-source software and develop an
automated labeling scheme to generate a reasonably large dataset of
binaries labeled with actual function usages. We augment this large but
limited labeled dataset with a pre-training step, which learns the
decompiled code statistics from a much larger unlabeled dataset. Thus
augmented, our learned labeling model can be combined with an existing
decompilation tool, Ghidra, to achieve substantially improved
performance in function call recovery, especially at higher levels of
optimization.},

  abstract = {Aiming at the problems of coupling between transformer input
characteristics and low accuracy of transformer fault diagnosis, SSA-MDS
and other soft technologies are used to analyze the key characteristics
of transformer faults, so as to improve the accuracy of transformer
fault diagnosis. The SSA algorithm cascade MDS algorithm to process the
DGA data is proposed. Subsequently, the TSSA-RF model is introduced to
classify the DGA data. The DGA data is first mapped to a
high-dimensional space. Next, the optimal feature subset is encoded
using the SSA algorithm to reduce irrelevant and redundant features. In
this study, the correlation between the optimal feature dimension and
the transformer fault diagnosis accuracy is investigated. the expression
of the optimal feature subset is obtained by decompiling the SSA
operator. The pre-processed data are classified using the RF model, and
the TSSA -RF model for classifying the DGA data is found with the
highest accuracy through the comparison of different optimization
algorithms. After the RF model is optimized using the TSSA algorithm,
its accuracy increases by 7.89\%, and the accuracy of the TSSA -RF model
is obtained as 92.11\%. The example results show that compared with the
original data, the proposed data processing algorithm improves the
diagnostic accuracy of transformer by 11.97 \% in the RF model. Compared
with multiple preprocessing methods, SSA-MDS has the highest accuracy.
Compared with the original data, the accuracy of TSSA-RF model increases
by 11.64 \%.},

  abstract = {With society's increasing reliance on computer systems and network
technology, the threat of malicious software grows more and more
serious. In the field of information security, malware detection has
been a key problem that academia and industry are committed to solving.
Machine learning is an effective method for processing large-scale data,
such as the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and deep neural
network technology. Although these types of detection methods can deal
with cyber threats, most feature extraction methods are based on the
statistical information features of portable executable (PE) files and
thus lack the decompiled code and execution flow structure of the PE
samples. Therefore, we propose a Control-Flow Graph (CFG)- and Graph
Isomorphism Network (GIN)-based malware classification system. The
feature vectors of CFG basic blocks are generated using the large-scale
pre-trained language model MiniLM, which is beneficial for the GIN to
further learn and compress the CFG-based representation, and classified
with multi-layer perceptron. In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness
of the representation under different dimensions and classifiers. To
evaluate our method, we set up a CFG-based malware detection graph
dataset from a PE file of the Blue Hexagon Open Dataset for Malware
Analysis (BODMAS), which we call the Malware Geometric Binary Dataset
(MGD-BINARY) and collected the experimental results of CFG
representation in different dimensions and classifier settings. The
evaluation results show that our proposal has proved an Accuracy metric
of 0.99160 and achieved 0.99148 Area Under the Curve (AUC) results.},

  abstract = {The decompiler is one of the most common tools for examining executable
binaries without the corresponding source code. It transforms binaries
into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Unfortunately,
decompiler output is far from readable because the decompilation process
is often incomplete. State-of-the-art techniques use machine learning to
predict missing information like variable names. While these approaches
are often able to suggest good variable names in context, no existing
work examines how the selection of training data influences these
machine learning models. We investigate how data provenance and the
quality of training data affect performance, and how well, if at all,
trained models generalize across software domains. We focus on the
variable renaming problem using one such machine learning model, DIRE.
We first describe DIRE in detail and the accompanying technique used to
generate training data from raw code. We also evaluate DIRE's overall
performance without respect to data quality. Next, we show how training
on more popular, possibly higher quality code (measured using GitHub
stars) leads to a more generalizable model because popular code tends to
have more diverse variable names. Finally, we evaluate how well DIRE
predicts domain-specific identifiers, propose a modification to
incorporate domain information, and show that it can predict identifiers
in domain-specific scenarios 23\% more frequently than the original DIRE
model.},

  abstract = {JNI programs are widely used thanks to the combined benefits of C and
Java programs. However, because understanding the interaction behaviors
between two different programming languages is challenging, JNI program
development is difficult to get right and vulnerable to security
attacks. Thus, researchers have proposed static analysis of JNI program
source code to detect bugs and security vulnerabilities in JNI programs.
Unfortunately, such source code analysis is not applicable to compiled
JNI programs that are not open-sourced or open-source JNI programs
containing third-party binary libraries. While JN-SAF, the
state-of-the-art analyzer for compiled JNI programs, can analyze binary
code, it has several limitations due to its symbolic execution and
summary-based bottom-up analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to statically analyze compiled JNI programs without their
source code using binary decompilation. Unlike JN-SAF that analyzes
binaries directly, our approach decompiles binaries and analyzes JNI
programs with the decompiled binaries using an existing JNI program
analyzer for source code. To decompile binaries to compilable C source
code with precise JNI-interoperation-related types, we improve an
existing decompilation tool by leveraging the characteristics of JNI
programs. Our evaluation shows that the approach is precise as almost
the same as the state-of-the-art JNI program analyzer for source code,
and more precise than JN-SAF.},

  abstract = {We introduce the new problem of hardware decompilation. Analogous to
software decompilation, hardware decompilation is about analyzing a
low-level artifact-in this case a netlist, i.e., a graph of wires and
logical gates representing a digital circuit-in order to recover
higher-level programming abstractions, and using those abstractions to
generate code written in a hardware description language (HDL). The
overall problem of hardware decompilation requires a number of pieces.
In this paper we focus on one specific piece of the puzzle: a technique
we call hardware loop rerolling. Hardware loop rerolling leverages clone
detection and program synthesis techniques to identify repeated logic in
netlists (such as would be synthesized from loops in the original HDL
code) and reroll them into syntactic loops in the recovered HDL code. We
evaluate hardware loop rerolling for hardware decompilation over a set
of hardware design benchmarks written in the PyRTL HDL and industry
standard SystemVerilog. Our implementation identifies and rerolls loops
in 52 out of 53 of the netlists in our benchmark suite, and we show
three examples of how hardware decompilation can provide concrete
benefits: transpilation between HDLs, faster simulation times over
netlists (with mean speedup of 6x), and artifact compaction (39\%
smaller on average).},

  abstract = {Android has been a constant target of cybercriminals that try to attack
one of the most used operating systems, commonly using malicious
applications (denominated malware) that, once installed on a device, can
harm users in several ways. Existing malware detection solutions are
usually invasive as they obtain classification features by performing
reverse engineering, decompilation, or disassembly of the analyzed
application, which infringes licenses and terms of use of applications.
In addition, these solutions often employ a single machine learning (ML)
model to detect various types of malware, resulting in several false
alarms. In this context, we propose an approach to detect Android
malware consisting of a set of specific-type detectors in which each one
performs a multi-stage analysis, based on rules and ML techniques, in
different phases of the application cycle (before and after its
installation). Our approach also differs from state-of-the-art solutions
by being non-invasive, since it leverages a process to obtain
application's features that does not infringe licenses and terms of use
of applications. In addition, according to experiments performed on a
real Android smartphone, our proposal presents the following additional
advantages over state-of-the-art solutions: a more efficient process to
classify applications that is three times faster and requires ten times
less CPU usage in some cases (saving device energy); and a better
detection performance, with higher balanced accuracy, nine times less
false positive cases, and ten times less false negative cases.},

targeting them have increased, posing severe threats to their security
and intellectual property rights. Existing simplistic datasets hinder
effective vulnerability detection, raising security concerns. To address
these challenges, we propose BiAn, a source code level smart contract
obfuscation method that generates complex vulnerability test datasets.
BiAn protects contracts by obfuscating data flows, control flows, and
code layouts, increasing complexity and making it harder for attackers
to discover vulnerabilities. Our experiments with buggy contracts showed
an average complexity enhancement of approximately 174\% after
obfuscation. Decompilers Vandal and Gigahorse had total failure rate
increments of 38.8\% and 40.5\% respectively. Obfuscated contracts also
decreased vulnerability detection rates in more than 50\% of cases for
ten widely-used static analysis detection tools.},

  abstract = {Most of the time, cybercriminals look for new ways to bypass security
controls by improving their attacks. In the 1980s, attackers developed
malware to kidnap user data by requesting payments. Malware is called a
ransomware. Recently, they have demanded payment in Bitcoin or any other
cryptocurrency. Ransomware is one of the most dangerous threats on the
Internet, and this type of malware could affect almost all devices.
Malware cipher device data, making them inaccessible to users. In this
study, a new method for Android ransomware classification was proposed.
This method implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for malware
classification based on images. This paper presents a novel method for
transforming an Android Application Package (APK) into a grayscale
image. The image creation relies on using Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques for text cleaning and Fuzzy Hashing to represent the
decompiled code from the APK in a set of hashes after preprocessing
using NLP techniques. The image is composed of n fuzzy hashes that
represent the APK. The method was tested using a dataset of 7,765
Android ransomware samples obtained from external researchers and public
sources. The accuracy of the proposed method was higher than that of
other methods in the literature.},

  abstract = {Familiar analysis for malware plays an important role in comprehending
the diversity of malicious behaviors and identifying the emerging
security threats. Existing studies mainly focus on classifying malware
into known families by supervised learning. However, these methods face
two main challenges, 1) the lack of a large amount of labeled data and
2) the poor effectiveness in identifying unknown families of malware. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called multiple
features (MulFC) based on unsupervised learning. In the method, we first
leverage a decompiling tool to extract multiple features, including
manifest features, application programming interface (API) features, and
opcode features. Then, the opcode features are preprocessed to filter
out the redundant ones to reduce the calculation cost. After that, we
adopt the Jaccard index to calculate the similarities between malware
and construct a malware network. Finally, InfoMap is applied to perform
the clustering on the basis of the malware network. Overall, MulFC does
not require the use of labeled data and can identify unknown families of
malware. Experiments are conducted on two datasets for the performance
evaluation of MulFC. The experimental results show that MulFC achieves
0.810 in terms of normalized mutual information, 0.576 in terms of

  abstract = {Java bytecode is a quite high-level language and, as such, it is fairly
easy to analyze and decompile with malicious intents, e.g., to tamper
with code and skip license checks. Code obfuscation was a first attempt
to mitigate malicious reverse-engineering based on static analysis.
However, obfuscated code can still be dynamically analyzed with standard
debuggers to perform step-wise execution and to inspect (or change)
memory content at important execution points, e.g., to alter the verdict
of license validity checks. Although some approaches have been proposed
to mitigate debugger-based attacks, they are only applicable to binary
compiled code and none address the challenge of protecting Java
bytecode.
In this article, we propose a novel approach to protect Java bytecode
from malicious debugging. Our approach is based on automated program
transformation to manipulate Java bytecode and split it into two binary
processes that debug each other (i.e., a self-debugging solution). In
fact, when the debugging interface is already engaged, an additional
malicious debugger cannot attach. To be resilient against typical
attacks, our approach adopts a series of technical solutions, e.g., an
encoded channel is shared by the two processes to avoid leaking
information, an authentication protocol is established to avoid
Man-in-the-middle attacks, and the computation is spread between the two
processes to prevent the attacker to replace or terminate either of
them.
We test our solution on 18 real-world Java applications, showing that
our approach can effectively block the most common debugging tasks
(either with the Java debugger or the GNU debugger) while preserving the
functional correctness of the protected programs. While the final
decision on when to activate this protection is still up to the
developers, the observed performance overhead was acceptable for common
desktop application domains.},

  abstract = {Java decompilers are programs that perform the reverse process of Java
compilers, i.e., they translate Java bytecode to Java source code. They
are essential for reverse engineering purposes and have become more
sophisticated and reliable over the years. However, it remains
challenging for modern Java decompilers to reliably perform correct
decompilation on real-world programs. To shed light on the key
challenges of Java decompilation, this paper provides the first
systematic study on the characteristics and causes of bugs in mature,
widely-used Java decompilers. We conduct the study by investigating 333
unique bugs from three popular Java decompilers. Our key findings and
observations include: (1) Although most of the reported bugs were found
when decompiling large, real-world code, 40.2\% of them have small test
cases for bug reproduction; (2) Over 80\% of the bugs manifest as
exceptions, syntactic errors, or semantic errors, and bugs with source
code artifacts are very likely semantic errors; (3) 57.7\%, 39.0\%, and
41.1\% of the bugs respectively are attributed to three stages of
decompilers-loading structure entities from bytecode, optimizing these
entities, and generating source code from these entities; (4) Bugs in
decompilers' type inference are the most complex to fix; and (5) Region
restoration for structures like loop, sugaring for special structures
like switch, and type inference of variables of generic types or
indistinguishable types are the three most significant challenges in
Java decompilation, which to some extent explains our findings in (3)
and (4).
Based on these findings, we present JD-Tester, a differential testing
framework for Java decompilers, and our experience of using it in
testing the three popular Java decompilers. JD-Tester utilizes different
Java program generators to construct executable Java tests and finds
exceptions, syntactic, and semantic inconsistencies (i.e. bugs) between
a generated test and its compiled-decompiled version (through
compilation and execution). In total, we have found 62 bugs in the three
decompilers, demonstrating both the effectiveness of JD-Tester, and the
importance of testing and validating Java decompilers.},

  abstract = {Industrial Control System (ICS) depends on the underlying Programmable
Logical Controllers (PLCs) to run. As such, the security of the internal
control logic of the PLCs is the top concern of ICS. Reversing analysis
and forensic work against PLC require extracting control logic from the
control application running inside PLC, which is still an unresolved
problem. To address the challenge, we propose a PLC decompile framework
named CLEVER, which can analyze the control application and extract the
control logic. First, we propose a simulation execution based code
extraction method, which is utilized to filter the control logic related
data. Then, to normalize the control application decompile process, an
intermediate representation (IR) is designed, which can simplify the
analysis process and enhance the extensibility of CLEVER. Finally, a
heuristic data flow analysis algorithm is proposed to find variable
dependency, and a sequential parsing method is utilized to reconstruct
the source code from the control application. To evaluate our work, real
world PLC hardware and programming software are used for the experiment.
We use 22 real-world, 58 hand-written, and 150 auto-generated control
applications to demonstrate the usability, correctness, and operational
efficiency of CLEVER.},

  abstract = {Cybersecurity attacks on embedded devices for industrial control systems
and cyber-physical systems may cause catastrophic physical damage as
well as economic loss. This could be achieved by infecting device
binaries with malware that modifies the physical characteristics of the
system operation. Mitigating such attacks benefits from reverse
engineering tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of
mathematical equations of the implemented algorithm. Conventional
reverse engineering tools can decompile binaries to low-level code, but
offer little semantic insight. This article proposes the REMaQE
automated framework for reverse engineering of math equations from
binary executables. Improving over state-of-the-art, REMaQE handles
equation parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or
pointers, and can reverse engineer equations from object-oriented
implementations such as C++ classes. Using REMaQE, we discovered a bug
in the Linux kernel thermal monitoring tool ``tmon.{''} To evaluate
REMaQE, we generate a dataset of 25,096 binaries with math equations
implemented in C and Simulink. REMaQE successfully recovers a
semantically matching equation for all 25,096 binaries. REMaQE executes
in 0.48 seconds on average and in up to 2 seconds for complex equations.
Real-time execution enables integration in an interactive math-oriented
reverse engineering workflow.},

  abstract = {Since funds or tokens in smart contracts are maintained through specific
state variables, contract audit, an effective means for security
assurance, particularly focuses on these variables and their related
operations. However, the absence of publicly accessible source code for
numerous contracts, with only bytecode exposed, hinders audit efforts.
Recovering variables and their types from Solidity bytecode is thus a
critical task in smart contract analysis and audit, yet this is a
challenging task because the bytecode loses variable and type
information, only with low-level data operated by stack manipulations
and untyped memory/storage accesses. The state-of-the-art smart contract
decompilers miss identifying many variables and incorrectly infer the
types for many identified variables. To this end, we propose VARLIFTER,
a lifter dedicated to the precise and efficient recovery of typed
variables. VARLIFTER interprets every read or written field of a data
region as at least one potential variable, and after discarding falsely
identified variables, it progressively refines the variable types based
on the variable behaviors in the form of operation sequences. We
evaluate VARLIFTER on 34,832 real-world Solidity smart contracts.
VARLIFTER attains a precision of 97.48\% and a recall of 91.84\% for
typed variable recovery. Moreover, VARLIFTER finishes analyzing 77\% of
smart contracts in around 10 seconds per contract. If VARLIFTER is used
to replace the variable recovery modules of the two state-of-the-art
Solidity bytecode decompilers, 52.4\%, and 74.6\% more typed variables
will be correctly recovered, respectively. The applications of VARLIFTER
to contract decompilation, contract audit, and contract bytecode fuzzing
illustrate that the recovered variable information improves many
contract analysis tasks.},

  abstract = {The exponential growth of Android applications has resulted in a surge
of malware threats, posing severe risks to user privacy and data
security. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel
malware detection approach utilizing an ensemble of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) for enhanced classification accuracy. The methodology
incorporates a multi-phase process, starting with the extraction and
preprocessing of APK (Android app) files. The preprocessing phase
involves decompressing, decompiling, and transforming the APK files into
bytecode and Dex files. The extracted byte data is converted into 1D
vectors and reshaped into 2D grayscale images, enabling efficient
feature learning through CNNs. The proposed ensemble of CNN-based models
undergoes comprehensive training, validation, and evaluation,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches. We
used two popular Android datasets to evaluate the performance of our
proposed model. Specifically, the model achieves an accuracy of 98.65\%,
F1-score of 96.43\% on the Drebin dataset and attains 97.91\% accuracy,
96.73\% of F1-score on the AMD dataset. These results confirm the mode's
ability to effectively identify Android malware with high precision and
reliability, outperforming traditional techniques. This research not
only underscores the potential of our proposed approach in malware
detection but also sets a foundation for future advancements. Future
efforts will focus on real-time malware detection, integration with
mobile security frameworks, and evaluation across diverse datasets to
ensure adaptability to emerging malware threats.},

  abstract = {Guarded Kleene Algebra with Tests (GKAT) provides a sound and complete
framework to reason about trace equivalence between simple imperative
programs. However, there are still several notable limitations. First,
GKAT is completely agnostic with respect to the meaning of primitives,
to keep equivalence decidable. Second, GKAT excludes non-local control
flow such as goto, break, and return. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce Control-Flow GKAT (CF-GKAT), a system that allows reasoning
about programs that include non-local control flow as well as hardcoded
values. CF-GKAT is able to soundly and completely verify trace
equivalence of a larger class of programs, while preserving the
nearly-linear efficiency of GKAT. This makes CF-GKAT suitable for the
verification of control-flow manipulating procedures, such as
decompilation and goto-elimination. To demonstrate CF-GKAT's abilities,
we validated the output of several highly non-trivial program
transformations, such as Erosa and Hendren's goto-elimination procedure
and the output of Ghidra decompiler. CF-GKAT opens up the application of
Kleene Algebra to a wider set of challenges, and provides an important
verification tool that can be applied to the field of decompilation and
control-flow transformation.},

  abstract = {Vulnerabilities are challenging to locate and repair, especially when
source code is unavailable and binary patching is required. Manual
methods are time-consuming, require significant expertise, and do not
scale to the rate at which new vulnerabilities are discovered. Automated
methods are an attractive alternative, and we propose Partially
Recompilable Decompilation (PRD) to help automate the process. PRD lifts
suspect binary functions to source, available for analysis, revision, or
review, and creates a patched binary using source- and binary-level
techniques. Although decompilation and recompilation do not typically
succeed on an entire binary, our approach does because it is limited to
a few functions, such as those identified by our binary fault
localization. We evaluate the assumptions underlying our approach and
find that, without any grammar or compilation restrictions, up to 79\%
of individual functions are successfully decompiled and recompiled. In
comparison, only 1.7\% of the full C-binaries succeed. When
recompilation succeeds, PRD produces test-equivalent binaries 93.0\% of
the time. We evaluate PRD in two contexts: a fully automated process
incorporating source-level Automated Program Repair (APR) methods; and
human-edited source-level repairs. When evaluated on DARPA Cyber Grand
Challenge (CGC) binaries, we find that PRD-enabled APR tools, operating
only on binaries, perform as well as, and sometimes better than
full-source tools, collectively mitigating 85 of the 148 scenarios, a
success rate consistent with the same tools operating with access to the
entire source code. PRD achieves similar success rates as the winning
CGC entries, sometimes finding higher-quality mitigations than those
produced by top CGC teams. For generality, the evaluation includes two
independently developed APR tools and C++, Rode0day, and real-world
binaries.},

  abstract = {Reverse engineering process serves essential functions in software
analysis and security auditing and malware detection but requires
significant time and effort. Researchers and practitioners now
investigate how Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology can automate and
improve different reverse engineering procedures. This survey provides
an extensive evaluation of recent AI-based reverse engineering
techniques which focus on software decompilation and function
identification as well as control flow recovery and vulnerability
analysis. The paper presents a classification system for existing
methods while comparing them through an analysis of their development
from traditional rule-based systems to contemporary deep learning
frameworks. The research examines fundamental datasets together with

  abstract = {The cybersecurity threats targeting industrial control systems (ICSs)
are evolving with increasing sophistication. Addressing the detection
blind spots in existing source code analysis techniques, this study
reveals a dual security paradox arising from code sensitivity: privacy
leakage risks caused by decompilation techniques and integrity
verification deficiencies in reverse engineering. This article
investigates three critical challenges: 1) what are the component flow
process and detection elements of ICS component source code? 2) how can
high-performance and reliable tracing and traceability be provided for
ICS component source code exceptions and routine detection? and 3) how
can privacy enhancement and trusted detection of ICS component source
code with high sensitivity be achieved? This article proposes a
blockchain-integrated trusted detection framework for ICS (BCTD-ICS),
delivering groundbreaking solutions: 1) establishing a lifecycle
circulation model that systematically maps component types,
stakeholders, and detection parameters; 2) developing a tripartite
collaborative architecture {[}blockchain- identification resolution
zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)], featuring a traceability mechanism with
trusted identification codes (resolution efficiency: 40 ms/105 queries)
to eliminate decompilation-induced privacy risks; and 3) creating an
industrial-oriented privacy enhancement system utilizing DBSCAN
clustering for intelligent sampling (26\% compression rate on BCN3D
Moveo) and optimizing ZK-SNARK protocols through Shamir's secret
sharing, establishing a backdoor-resistant distributed parameter
generation system (time delay increment < 100 ms). Experimentally
verified, our solution enables ICS component code detection
supply-chain-wise without sensitive data leakage in real-world
industries. This work establishes a novel trusted detection paradigm for
ICS, advancing detection efficiency and credibility under strict privacy
preservation requirements, meeting Industry 4.0 security demands.},

  abstract = {The complexities introduced by compiler optimization have long stood as
a significant obstacle in binary analysis and reverse engineering.
Function inlining, in particular, complicates function recognition by
replacing function calls with the entire body of the callee, mixing code
from multiple functions. State-of-the-art approaches can identify
inlined functions at basic block granularity, but cannot determine which
instructions belong to each function and precisely deduce inlined
boundaries. Without this information, further analyses such as
decompilation cannot be performed effectively. This article presents
Highliner, a novel approach that improves state-of-the-art approaches by
identifying inline instances at instruction-level granularity. Highliner
operates downstream of block-level detectors: given basic blocks
reported by state-of-the-art approaches as belonging to a specific
inlined function, it labels each instruction as Inlined or Not inlined
and recovers the inlined-function boundaries. We treat the problem as a
sequence tagging task typical of NLP and implement a learning-based
technique involving instruction embedding and recurrent neural networks.
We compile a dataset of open-source projects with different
optimizations and use the DWARF debug information standard to construct
labeled sequences of inline instructions. We use this dataset to train,
validate, and test a sequence labeling architecture in which
instructions are encoded via the pre-trained assembly language
transformer PalmTree and then processed by an RNN-based classifier to
produce binary predictions. When evaluated as a binary classifier,
Highliner achieves an F1-score of 0.94 overall. In addition, when
specifically tested on recognizing function boundaries, Highliner
achieves an Accuracy of 0.82 on initial boundaries and 0.83 on final
boundaries.},

  abstract = {Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively
employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program
comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity
smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in
reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck
of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate function identification,
incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These
deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program
logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new
framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis
(SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the
complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow
analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically,
SmartHalo constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to
extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to
create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM
outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification.
Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart
contract functions shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the
quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g.,
Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o mini with SmartHalo further
enhances its performance, achieving a precision of 91.32\% and a recall
of 87.38\% for function boundaries, a precision of 90.40\% and a recall
of 88.82\% for variable types, and a precision of 80.66\% and a recall
of 91.78\% for contract attributes.},

  abstract = {The Android operating system continues to face escalating security
challenges, primarily due to its open-source nature and the rapid
proliferation of applications from untrusted sources. Traditional static
analysis tools lack the flexibility to capture evolving malware
behaviors, limiting their interpretability and scalability. Large
Language Models (LLMs) are now applied in cybersecurity for malware
detection, phishing classification, and cyber threat intelligence.
However, their use has not been extended to producing detailed and
interpretable Android malware analysis reports. This study integrates
LLMs into Android malware analysis by creating a dataset for instruction
tuning and fine-tuning the Qwen-7B model using the LoRA method. The
model MalQwen is developed by fine-tuning Qwen 2.5-7B with 429 malware
samples containing decompiled code and expert labeled security reports.
MalQwen outperforms models like Gemini and LLaMA, achieving a BERTscore
of 0.84 for SMS malware and a Perplexity score of 3.30 for Scareware.
These findings confirm MalQwen's superior performance in generating
precise malware reports, validating LLMs as a powerful new method for
Android malware analysis.},

@article{WOS:001662944300026,
  abstract = {Cryptographic techniques are widely used to safeguard software against
privacy breaches. Efficiently detecting encryption algorithms in
software to determine whether they meet security requirements is a
critical task. However, traditional static and dynamic detection methods
often suffer from high false alarm rates or low efficiency, as they
cannot fully capture the structural and semantic features of
cryptographic algorithms. In this article, we propose FirmCCF, a
vulnerability detection tool for custom cryptographic functions in
Internet of Things (IoT) devices. FirmCCF leverages an improved deep
learning encoder-decoder classification model, CodeT5-cate, to identify
and classify cryptographic functions in source code and decompiled
firmware. It then outputs highly structured meta-level attributes of
cryptographic functions via a large language model (LLM) and detects
vulnerabilities through a query-driven approach. FirmCCF achieves
99.97\% accuracy, 99.72\% recall, and 99.86\% \$F1\$ -score in detecting
cryptographic functions from binary files. We further define seven
security rules, encode them as queries, and use them to uncover seven
categories of vulnerabilities. An evaluation of 40902 function codes
revealed 46 vulnerabilities, including eight previously unknown issues.
Our work highlights the urgent need for systematic assessment solutions
to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in custom cryptographic
functions.},
