  abstract = {This paper presents a methodology for generating formally proven equivalence theorems between decompiled x86-64 machine code and big step semantics. These proofs are built on top of two additional contributions. First, a robust and tested formal x86-64 machine model containing small step semantics for 1625 instructions. Second, a decompilation-into-logic methodology supporting both x86-64 assembly and machine code at large scale. This work enables black-box binary verification, i.e., formal verification of a binary where source code is unavailable. As such, it can be applied to safety-critical systems that consist of legacy components, or components whose source code is unavailable due to proprietary reasons. The methodology minimizes the trusted code base by leveraging machine-learned semantics to build a formal machine model. We apply the methodology to several case studies, including binaries that heavily rely on the SSE2 floating-point instruction set, and binaries that are obtained by compiling code that is obtained by inlining assembly into C code.},

  abstract = {Analysis of binary software plays a critical role in software security. Reverse engineers analyze binaries to discover vulnerabilities, patch legacy software, and detect malware. Most of the reverse engineering tools have been developed from a practical point of view, and do not provide any guarantees with their results. Recently, formally verified reverse engineering and decompilation have gained traction. These formal tools are for the most part proof-of-concept systems not yet suitable for real-world reverse-engineering tasks. In this poster, we explore the idea of formalizing part of an existing decompilation tool instead. We focus on the lifting from assembly to the IR P-Code in one of the most popular decompilers, Ghidra. This step occurs immediately after disassembly. We are developing a proof system inside the Isabelle theorem prover, to automatically prove semantical equivalence between the assembly and P-Code instructions. We leverage machine-learned x86-64 semantics, to stay as close as possible to actual CPU behavior. This approach has uncovered several shortcomings in Ghidra's P-Code and the lifting it performs. By using a theorem prover, we obtain guarantees that our system of formal semantics and lifting is internally consistent. This work brings the powerful guarantees that formal methods provide in reverse engineering research to the real world.},

  abstract = {WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) has emerged as a cornerstone of web development, offering a compact binary format that allows high-performance applications to run at near-native speeds in web browsers. Despite its advantages, Wasm's binary nature presents significant challenges for developers and researchers, particularly regarding readability when debugging or analyzing web applications. Therefore, effective decompilation becomes crucial. Unfortunately, traditional decompilers often struggle with producing readable outputs. While some large language model (LLM)-based decompilers have shown good compatibility with general binary files, they still face specific challenges when dealing with Wasm.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, WaDec, which is the first use of a fine-tuned LLM to interpret and decompile Wasm binary code into a higher-level, more comprehensible source code representation. The LLM was meticulously fine-tuned using a specialized dataset of wat-c code snippets, employing self-supervised learning techniques. This enables WaDec to effectively decompile not only complete wat functions but also finer-grained wat code snippets. Our experiments demonstrate that WaDec markedly outperforms current state-of-the-art tools, offering substantial improvements across several metrics. It achieves a code inflation rate of only 3.34%, a dramatic 97% reduction compared to the state-of-the-art's 116.94%. Unlike the output of baselines that cannot be directly compiled or executed, WaDec maintains a recompilability rate of 52.11%, a re-execution rate of 43.55%, and an output consistency of 27.15%. Additionally, it significantly exceeds state-of-the-art performance in AST edit distance similarity by 185%, cyclomatic complexity by 8%, and cosine similarity by 41%, achieving an average code similarity above 50%. In summary, WaDec enhances understanding of the code's structure and execution flow, facilitating automated code analysis, optimization, and security auditing.},

  abstract = {The vision of Web3 is to improve user control over data and assets, but one challenge that complicates this vision is the prevalence of non-transparent, scam-prone applications and vulnerable smart contracts that put Web3 users at risk. While code audits are one solution to this problem, the lack of smart contracts source code on many blockchain platforms, such as Sui, hinders the ease of auditing. A promising approach to this issue is the use of a decompiler to reverse-engineer smart contract bytecode. However, existing decompilers for Sui produce code that is difficult to understand and cannot be directly recompiled. To address this, we developed the SuiGPT Move AI Decompiler (MAD), a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered web application that decompiles smart contract bytecodes on Sui into logically correct, human-readable, and re-compilable source code with prompt engineering. Our evaluation shows that MAD's output successfully passes original unit tests and achieves a 73.33% recompilation success rate on real-world smart contracts. Additionally, newer models tend to deliver improved performance, suggesting that MAD's approach will become increasingly effective as LLMs continue to advance. In a user study involving 12 developers, we found that MAD significantly reduced the auditing workload compared to using traditional decompilers. Participants found MAD's outputs comparable to the original source code, improving accessibility for understanding and auditing non-open-source smart contracts. Through qualitative interviews with these developers and Web3 projects, we further discussed the strengths and concerns of MAD. MAD has practical implications for blockchain smart contract transparency, auditing, and education. It empowers users to easily and independently review and audit non-open-source smart contracts, fostering accountability and decentralization. Moreover, MAD's methodology could potentially extend to other smart contract languages, like Solidity, further enhancing Web3 transparency.},

  abstract = {Understanding the Ethereum smart contract bytecode is essential for ensuring cryptoeconomics security. However, existing decompilers primarily convert bytecode into pseudocode, which is not easily comprehensible for general users, potentially leading to misunderstanding of contract behavior and increased vulnerability to scams or exploits. In this paper, we propose DiSCo, the first LLMs-based EVM decompilation pipeline, which aims to enable LLMs to understand the opaque bytecode and lift it into smart contract code. DiSCo introduces three core technologies. First, a logic-invariant intermediate representation is proposed to reproject the low-level bytecode into high-level abstracted units. The second technique involves semantic enhancement based on a novel type-aware graph model to infer stripped variables during compilation, enhancing the lifting effect. The third technology is a flexible method incorporating code specifications to construct LLM-comprehensible prompts for source code generation. Extensive experiments illustrate that our generated code guarantees a high compilability rate at 75%, with differential fuzzing pass rate averaging at 50%. Manual validation results further indicate that the generated solidity contracts significantly outperforms baseline methods in tasks such as code comprehension and attack reproduction.},

  abstract = {Analysis of binary executables implementing mathematical equations can benefit from the reverse engineering of semantic information about the implementation. Traditional algorithmic reverse engineering tools either do not recover semantic information or rely on dynamic analysis and symbolic execution with high reverse engineering time. Algorithmic tools also require significant re-engineering effort to target new platforms and languages. Recently, neural methods for decompilation have been developed to recover human-like source code, but they do not extract semantic information explicitly. We develop REMEND, a neural decompilation framework to reverse engineer math equations from binaries to explicitly recover program semantics like data flow and order of operations. REMEND combines a transformer encoder-decoder model for neural decompilation with algorithmic processing for enhanced symbolic reasoning necessary for math equations. REMEND is the first work to demonstrate that transformers for neural decompilation go beyond source code and reason about program semantics in the form of math equations. We train on a synthetically generated dataset containing multiple implementations and compilations of math equations to produce a robust neural decompilation model and demonstrate retargettability. REMEND obtains an accuracy of 89.8% to 92.4% across three Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs), three optimization levels, and two programming languages with a single trained model, extending the capability of state-of-the-art neural decompilers. We achieve high accuracy with a small model of upto 12 million parameters and an average execution time of 0.132 seconds per function. On a real-world dataset collected from open-source programs, REMEND generalizes better than state-of-the-art neural decompilers despite being trained with synthetic data, achieving 8% higher accuracy.

decompilers is often poor. With advancements in language models, several

Inspired by compiler toolchains, we propose a novel approach to enhance

our approach, drawing insights from both paradigms. Specifically, we
present a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model called IRaDT tailored
to refine decompilation outputs at the intermediate representation
level. Through this hybridization, we aim to address the limitations of
existing methodologies and achieve more accurate and robust
decompilation. We construct a diverse decompilation dataset targeting IR

indicate that IRaDT has the ability to improve the readability of IR

to aging hardware and outdated software environments. Traditionally,
software modernization required extensive manual effort, involving
reverse engineering, code rewriting, and re-architecting. However,
advancements in large language models (LLMs) have introduced new
possibilities for automating software translation and modernization.
This paper explores the feasibility of using LLMs for modernizing
90s-era Windows applications, specifically migrating legacy C and C++
code to Python. Our methodology includes decompilation, source code
analysis, automated translation using ChatGPT, and user interface
reconstruction. We empirically evaluate three software projects by
analyzing LLM-based translation accuracy across different code
structures, including algorithmic logic, file handling, and graphical
interfaces. Results indicate that while LLMs achieve high translation
accuracy (-88\%) for structured code, challenges persist in handling
decompiled code and user interface generation. The study provides
insights into the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in real-world
software renovation, offering guidelines for leveraging machine learning

  abstract = {The goal of decompilation is to convert compiled low-level code (e.g.,
assembly code) back into high-level programming languages, enabling
analysis in scenarios where source code is unavailable. This task
supports various reverse engineering applications, such as vulnerability
identification, malware analysis, and legacy software migration. The
end-to-end decompilation method based on large language models (LLMs)
reduces reliance on additional tools and minimizes manual intervention
due to its inherent properties. However, previous end-to-end methods
often lose critical information necessary for reconstructing control
flow structures and variables when processing binary files, making it
challenging to accurately recover the program's logic. To address these
issues, we propose the ReF Decompile method, which incorporates the
following innovations: (1) The Relabeling strategy replaces jump target
addresses with labels, preserving control flow clarity. (2) The Function
Call strategy infers variable types and retrieves missing variable
information from binary files. Experimental results on the
Humaneval-Decompile Benchmark demonstrate that ReF Decompile surpasses
comparable baselines and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of
61.43\%.},

@article{WOS:001657340000001,
  abstract = {The proliferation of binary vulnerabilities in the software supply chain
has become a critical security challenge. Existing vulnerability
detection approaches-including dynamic analysis, static analysis, and
decompilation-assisted analysis-all suffer from limitations such as
insufficient coverage, high false-positive and false-negative rates, or
poor compatibility. Although decompilation technology can serve as a
bridge connecting binary-code and source-code vulnerability detection
tools, current schemes suffer from inadequate semantic restoration
quality and lack of tool compatibility. To address these issues, this
paper proposes LLMVulDecompiler, a binary decompilation model based on
fine-tuned large language models designed to generate high-precision
decompiled code that integrates directly with source-code static
analysis tools. We construct a dedicated training and evaluation dataset
that covers multiple compiler optimization levels (e.g., O0-O3) and a
diverse set of program functionalities. We adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
strategy that involves first building foundational decompilation
capabilities, then enhancing vulnerability-specific features.
Additionally, we design a low-cost inference pipeline and establish
multi-dimensional evaluation criteria, including restoration similarity,
compilation success rate, and functional correctness. Experimental
results show that the model significantly outperforms baseline models in
terms of average edit distance, compilation success rate, and black-box
test pass rate on the HumanEval-C benchmark. In tests on 12 real-world
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) instances, the approach
achieved a detection accuracy of 91.7\%, with substantially reduced
false-positive and false-negative rates. This study demonstrates the
effectiveness of specialized fine-tuning of large language models for
binary decompilation and vulnerability detection, offering a new pathway
for binary security analysis.},
