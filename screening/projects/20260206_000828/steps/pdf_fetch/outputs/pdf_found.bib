  abstract = {The decompiler is one of the most common tools for examining binaries without corresponding source code. It transforms binaries into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Decompilers can reconstruct much of the information that is lost during the compilation process (e.g., structure and type information). Unfortunately, they do not reconstruct semantically meaningful variable names, which are known to increase code understandability. We propose the Decompiled Identifier Renaming Engine (DIRE), a novel probabilistic technique for variable name recovery that uses both lexical and structural information recovered by the decompiler. We also present a technique for generating corpora suitable for training and evaluating models of decompiled code renaming, which we use to create a corpus of 164,632 unique x86-64 binaries generated from C projects mined from GitHub.1 Our results show that on this corpus DIRE can predict variable names identical to the names in the original source code up to 74.3% of the time.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a widely used process for reverse engineers to significantly enhance code readability by lifting assembly code to a higher-level C-like language, pseudo-code. Nevertheless, the process of compilation and stripping irreversibly discards high-level semantic information that is crucial to code comprehension, such as comments, identifier names, and types. Existing approaches typically recover only one type of information, making them suboptimal for semantic inference. In this paper, we treat pseudo-code as a special programming language, then present a unified pre-trained model, HexT5, that is trained on vast amounts of natural language comments, source identifiers, and pseudo-code using novel pseudo-code-based pretraining objectives. We fine-tune HexT5 on various downstream tasks, including code summarization, variable name recovery, function name recovery, and similarity detection. Comprehensive experiments show that HexT5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on four downstream tasks, and it demonstrates the robust effectiveness and generalizability of HexT5 for binary-related tasks.},

  abstract = {Decompilation is a well-studied area with numerous high-quality tools available. These are frequently used for security tasks and to port legacy code. However, they regularly generate difficult-to-read programs and require a large amount of engineering effort to support new programming languages and ISAs. Recent interest in neural approaches has produced portable tools that generate readable code. Nevertheless, to-date such techniques are usually restricted to synthetic programs without optimization, and no models have evaluated their portability. Furthermore, while the code generated may be more readable, it is usually incorrect.This paper presents SLaDe, a Small Language model Decompiler based on a sequence-to-sequence Transformer trained over real-world code and augmented with a type inference engine. We utilize a novel tokenizer, dropout-free regularization, and type inference to generate programs that are more readable and accurate than standard analytic and recent neural approaches. Unlike standard approaches, SLaDe can infer out-of-context types and unlike neural approaches, it generates correct code.We evaluate SLaDe on over 4,000 ExeBench functions on two ISAs and at two optimization levels. SLaDe is up to 6\texttimes{} more accurate than Ghidra, a state-of-the-art, industrial-strength decompiler and up to 4\texttimes{} more accurate than the large language model ChatGPT and generates significantly more readable code than both.},

  abstract = {Compiled binary executables are often the only available artifact in reverse engineering, malware analysis, and software systems maintenance. Unfortunately, the lack of semantic information like variable types makes comprehending binaries difficult. In efforts to improve the comprehensibility of binaries, researchers have recently used machine learning techniques to predict semantic information contained in the original source code. Chen et al. implemented DIRTY, a Transformer-based Encoder-Decoder architecture capable of augmenting decompiled code with variable names and types by leveraging decompiler output tokens and variable size information. Chen et al. were able to demonstrate a substantial increase in name and type extraction accuracy on Hex-Rays decompiler outputs compared to existing static analysis and AI-based techniques. We extend the original DIRTY results by re-training the DIRTY model on a dataset produced by the open-source Ghidra decompiler. Although Chen et al. concluded that Ghidra was not a suitable decompiler candidate due to its difficulty in parsing and incorporating DWARF symbols during analysis, we demonstrate that straightforward parsing of variable data generated by Ghidra results in similar retyping performance. We hope this work inspires further interest and adoption of the Ghidra decompiler for use in research projects.},

For this purpose, the author's approach of “Genetic Reverse Engineering of Machine Code” (GREMC) is proposed. The essence of this approach lies in the use of artificial intelligence in the field of genetic algorithms to restore the source code of software executed in the form of machine code on cyber-physical devices for Industry 4.0. The resulting code can then be analysed for vulnerabilities by an expert. One issue that arises during genetic reverse engineering is predicting the size of the source code based on its machine representation (i.e., in an object or executable file). The article is devoted to solving this problem for functions in the C programming language. To do this, a method for obtaining a relationship between the sizes of the source and machine code of individual functions is described, which consists of steps such as loading a dataset with C-functions, isolating the function code in it, preprocessing them, compiling them into machine code, calculating the required sizes, building dependencies between each source code size and the corresponding machine code sizes, generating the final table and determining the dependency formula. An experiment is carried out using a software prototype that implements the method; ExeBench with 83 thousand C-functions is taken as a dataset. Justifications are given regarding the appearance of abnormal machine code sizes and their impact on the dependence formula.},

Information about the source code is irrevocably lost in the compilation process. While modern decompilers attempt to generate C-style source code from a binary, they cannot recover lost variable names. Prior works have explored machine learning techniques for predicting variable names in decompiled code. However, the state-of-the-art systems, DIRE and DIRTY, generalize poorly to functions in the testing set that are not included in the training set—31.8% for DIRE on DIRTY’s data set and 36.9% for DIRTY on DIRTY’s data set.In this paper, we present VarBERT, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to predict meaningful variable names in decompilation output. An advantage of VarBERT is that we can pre-train on human source code and then fine-tune the model to the task of predicting variable names. We also create a new data set VarCorpus, which significantly expands the size and variety of the data set. Our evaluation of VarBERT on VarCorpus, demonstrates a significant improvement in predicting the developer’s original variable names for O2 optimized binaries achieving accuracies of 54.43% for IDA and 54.49% for Ghidra. VarBERT is strictly better than state-of-the-art techniques: On a subset of VarCorpus, VarBERT could predict the developer’s original variable names 50.70% of the time, while DIRE and DIRTY predicted original variable names 35.94% and 38.00% of the time, respectively.},

  abstract = {Python is one of the most popular programming languages among both industry developers and malware authors. Despite demand for Python decompilers, community efforts to maintain automatic Python decompilation tools have been hindered by Python's aggressive language improvements and unstable bytecode specification. Every year, language features are added, code generation undergoes significant changes, and opcodes are added, deleted, and modified. Our research aims to integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with classical Programming Language (PL) theory to create a Python decompiler that accomodates evolving language features and changes to the bytecode specification with minimal human maintenance effort. PyLINGUAL plugs in data-driven NLP components to a version-agnostic core to automatically absorb superficial bytecode and compiler changes, while leveraging programmatic components for abstract control flow reconstruction. To establish trust in the decompilation results, we introduce a stringent correctness measure based on “perfect decompilation”, a statically verifiable refinement of semantic equivalence. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with extensive real-world datasets of benign and malicious Python source code and their corresponding compiled PYC binaries. Our research makes three major contributions: (1) we present PyLINGUAL, a scalable, data-driven decompilation framework with state-of-the-art support for Python versions 3.6 through 3.12, improving the perfect decompilation rate by an average of 45% over the best results of existing decompiler across four datasets; (2) we provide a Python decompiler evaluation framework that verifies decompilation results with perfect decompilation; and (3) we launch PyLINGUAL as a public online service.},

  abstract = {Static binary analysis is a widely used approach for ensuring the security of closed-source software. However, the absence of type information in stripped binaries, particularly for composite data types, poses significant challenges for both static analyzers and reverse engineering experts in achieving efficient and accurate analysis. Existing methods often struggle with inaccuracies and scalability limitations when dealing with such data types. To address these problems, we present Typeforge, a novel approach inspired by the workflow of reverse engineering experts, which uses a two-stage synthesis-selection strategy to automate the recovery of composite data types from stripped binaries. We design a new graph structure, the Type Flow Graph (TFG) to represent type information within stripped binaries. In the first stage, TFG-based Type Synthesis focuses on efficiently and accurately building constraints and synthesizing possible composite type declarations from the stripped binaries. In the second stage, we propose an LLM-assisted double-elimination framework to select the best-fit type declaration from the candidates by assessing the readability of the decompiled code. Our comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrates that TYPEFORGE achieves F1 scores of 81.7% and 88.2% in Composite Data Type Identification and Layout Recovery, respectively, substantially outperforming existing methods. Additionally, TYPEFORGE achieves an F1 score of 72.1% in Relationship Recovery, a particularly challenging task for previous approaches. Furthermore, TYPEFORGE has significantly lower time overhead, requiring only about 3.8% of the time taken by OSPREY, the best-performing existing approach, making it a promising solution for various real-world reverse engineering tasks.},

  abstract = {The growing demand for high-performance tensor programs on GPUs, especially for large language models (LLMs), necessitates advanced compilation and optimization techniques. However, the critical task of analyzing optimized, low-level PTX code for performance tuning or understanding poses significant challenges. While LLMs hold promise for PTX-to-CUDA de-compilation to improve code intelligibility, their effectiveness is severely limited by the scarcity of aligned training data and the inherent complexity of highly optimized, unrolled PTX code.In this work, we explore methodologies to significantly enhance LLM capabilities for accurate and readable PTX-to-CUDA decompilation and present PtxDec, a decompilation prototype implementing our approach. To overcome the critical barrier of data scarcity, we develop a compiler-based data augmentation framework coupled with rigorous post-processing, enabling the creation of a large-scale, high-quality dataset of 400K aligned CUDA-PTX kernel pairs for effective LLM training. Furthermore, to empower LLMs to handle the complexity of optimized PTX, we introduce Rolled-PTX—an intermediate representation generated through heuristic loop rerolling during preprocessing. Rolled-PTX condenses unrolled patterns, drastically simplifying the input structure presented to the LLM and aligning it better with higher-level loop constructs.Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PtxDec achieves substantial performance gains: our approach yields a 2.3×–3.1× improvement in functional accuracy over baseline methods, alongside significant enhancements in generated code readability and scheduling consistency with the original optimized kernels. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of each proposed component to the overall performance.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work tackling PTX-to-CUDA decompilation, specifically focusing on and demonstrating effective strategies for augmenting LLMs to overcome the key challenges in this domain.},

  abstract = {Decompilation can convert binary programs into clear C-style pseudocode, which is of great value in a wide range of security applications. Existing research primarily focuses on recovering symbolic information in pseudocode, such as function names, variable names, and data types, but neglecting structural information. We observe that even when symbolic information is fully preserved, severe and complex structure distortions remain in the pseudocode, greatly impairing code readability and comprehension. In this work, we first systematically investigate structure distortions in decompiled pseudocode, revealing their variation patterns through quantitative analysis. Using open coding, we derive a taxonomy comprising six top-level categories of structure distortions. Building upon this taxonomy, we propose PseudoFix, a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-based in-context learning. PseudoFix employs semantic retrieval to select the most relevant few-shot examples that provide structure distortion knowledge, and combines this with the well-structured coding patterns learned by LLMs from vast source code repositories, to efficiently refactor distorted pseudocode. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PseudoFix significantly improves pseudocode readability, achieving up to a 34% reduction in Halstead Complexity Effort and a 105% increase in BLEU-4 score. Notably, it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both temporary variable elimination and goto statement removal tasks. Additionally, human evaluations yield consistently positive feedback from users across readability, consistency, and reasonability.},

  abstract = {Decompilation plays a critical role in firmware analysis and reverse engineering by enabling the recovery of high-level source code from binary executables. However, existing neural decompilation models often face challenges due to the semantic gap between assembly code and high-level languages, and they typically require large-scale models that impose significant computational demands. In this paper, we propose DECodeT5, a lightweight and efficient neural decompilation method for the C language. DECodeT5 builds upon the CodeT5 code generation model by integrating a pre-trained assembly encoder in place of its original embedding layer. This modification allows for more effective semantic learning from assembly code, improving the model’s ability to capture the intricacies of assembly-to-source code mapping. The architecture of DECodeT5 not only accelerates convergence during end-to-end decompilation tasks but also supports rapid adaptation across different compilers and instruction set architectures (ISAs) by swapping out the encoder module as needed. Our experimental evaluation on the HumanEval and Exebench benchmarks reveals that DECodeT5 significantly improves semantic recovery accuracy, outperforming Ghidra by over 83% and LLM4Decompile by more than 43% in terms of execution recovery. Furthermore, DECodeT5 maintains a compact model size of only 360M parameters, providing inference speeds that are twice as fast as LLM4Decompile. These results underscore DECodeT5’s suitability for deployment in resource-constrained environments and its flexibility in adapting to real-world reverse engineering scenarios, offering a practical solution for modern firmware analysis and security tasks.},

  abstract = {Decompilation, recovering source code from binary, is useful in many situations where it is necessary to analyze or understand software for which source code is not available. Source code is much easier for humans to read than binary code, and there are many tools available to analyze source code. Existing decompilation techniques often generate source code that is difficult for humans to understand because the generated code often does not use the coding idioms that programmers use. Differences from human-written code also reduce the effectiveness of analysis tools on the decompiled source code. To address the problem of differences between decompiled code and human-written code, we present a novel technique for decompiling binary code snippets using a model based on Recurrent Neural Networks. The model learns properties and patterns that occur in source code and uses them to produce decompilation output. We train and evaluate our technique on snippets of binary machine code compiled from C source code. The general approach we outline in this paper is not language-specific and requires little or no domain knowledge of a language and its properties or how a compiler operates, making the approach easily extensible to new languages and constructs. Furthermore, the technique can be extended and applied in situations to which traditional decompilers are not targeted, such as for decompilation of isolated binary snippets; fast, on-demand decompilation; domain-specific learned decompilation; optimizing for readability of decompilation; and recovering control flow constructs, comments, and variable or function names. We show that the translations produced by this technique are often accurate or close and can provide a useful picture of the snippet's behavior.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to binary decompilation, yet they still treat code as plain text and ignore the graphs that govern program control flow. This limitation often yields syntactically fragile and logically inconsistent output, especially for optimized binaries. This paper presents \textsc\{HELIOS\}, a framework that reframes LLM-based decompilation as a structured reasoning task. \textsc\{HELIOS\} summarizes a binary's control flow and function calls into a hierarchical text representation that spells out basic blocks, their successors, and high-level patterns such as loops and conditionals. This representation is supplied to a general-purpose LLM, along with raw decompiler output, optionally combined with a compiler-in-the-loop that returns error messages when the generated code fails to build. On HumanEval-Decompile for \texttt\{x86\_64\}, \textsc\{HELIOS\} raises average object file compilability from 45.0\% to 85.2\% for Gemini~2.0 and from 71.4\% to 89.6\% for GPT-4.1~Mini. With compiler feedback, compilability exceeds 94\% and functional correctness improves by up to 5.6 percentage points over text-only prompting. Across six architectures drawn from x86, ARM, and MIPS, \textsc\{HELIOS\} reduces the spread in functional correctness while keeping syntactic correctness consistently high, all without fine-tuning. These properties make \textsc\{HELIOS\} a practical building block for reverse engineering workflows in security settings where analysts need recompilable, semantically faithful code across diverse hardware targets. },

  abstract = {Decompilation is widely used in reverse engineering to recover high-level language code from binary executables. While recent approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files. This limitation significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics from assembly code. To address this limitation, we propose \\saltm, a novel binary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared between binary and source code. The core idea of \\saltm is to abstract selected binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery. Given a binary function, \\saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree (\\salt) from assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language. It then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed \\salt to generate decompiled code. Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol recovery to improve readability and correctness. We compare \\saltm to three categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercial decompilers, and decompilation methods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP, Exebench). Our experimental results demonstrate that \\saltm is highly effective in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\\\% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with a 10.6\\\% improvement). The results further validate its robustness against four commonly used obfuscation techniques.

  abstract = {Decompilation is the procedure of transforming binary programs into a high-level representation, such as source code, for human analysts to examine. While modern decompilers can reconstruct and recover much information that is discarded during compilation, inferring variable names is still extremely difficult. Inspired by recent advances in natural language processing, we propose a novel solution to infer variable names in decompiled code based on Masked Language Modeling, Byte-Pair Encoding, and neural architectures such as Transformers and BERT. Our solution takes \textit\{raw\} decompiler output, the less semantically meaningful code, as input, and enriches it using our proposed \textit\{finetuning\} technique, Constrained Masked Language Modeling. Using Constrained Masked Language Modeling introduces the challenge of predicting the number of masked tokens for the original variable name. We address this \textit\{count of token prediction\} challenge with our post-processing algorithm. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, our trained VarBERT model is simpler and of much better performance. We evaluated our model on an existing large-scale data set with 164,632 binaries and showed that it can predict variable names identical to the ones present in the original source code up to 84.15\% of the time. },

  abstract = {Decompilation aims to transform a low-level program language (LPL) (eg., binary file) into its functionally-equivalent high-level program language (HPL) (e.g., C/C++). It is a core technology in software security, especially in vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability. However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries. NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance. Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks. },

  abstract = {The widespread lack of broad source code verification on blockchain explorers such as Etherscan, where despite 78,047,845 smart contracts deployed on Ethereum (as of May 26, 2025), a mere 767,520 (< 1%) are open source, presents a severe impediment to blockchain security. This opacity necessitates the automated semantic analysis of on-chain smart contract bytecode, a fundamental research challenge with direct implications for identifying vulnerabilities and understanding malicious behavior. Prevailing decompilers struggle to reverse bytecode in a readable manner, often yielding convoluted code that critically hampers vulnerability analysis and thwarts efforts to dissect contract functionalities for security auditing. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a pioneering decompilation pipeline that, for the first time, successfully leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into human-readable and semantically faithful Solidity code. Our novel methodology first employs rigorous static program analysis to convert bytecode into a structured three-address code (TAC) representation. This intermediate representation then guides a Llama-3.2-3B model, specifically fine-tuned on a comprehensive dataset of 238,446 TAC-to-Solidity function pairs, to generate high-quality Solidity. This approach uniquely recovers meaningful variable names, intricate control flow, and precise function signatures. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates a significant leap beyond traditional decompilers, achieving an average semantic similarity of 0.82 with original source and markedly superior readability. The practical viability and effectiveness of our research are demonstrated through its implementation in a publicly accessible system, available at https://evmdecompiler.com. },

(2) Fine-grained Alignment Enhancement (FAE), which meticulously aligns assembly code with source code at the statement level by leveraging debugging information, is employed during the fine-tuning phase to achieve further improvements in decompilation. By integrating these two methods, we achieved a Re-Executability performance improvement of approximately 3.90% on the Decompile-Eval benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance of 52.41%.

  abstract = {Reverse engineering of binary executables is a critical problem in the computer security domain. On the one hand, malicious parties may recover interpretable source codes from the software products to gain commercial advantages. On the other hand, binary decompilation can be leveraged for code vulnerability analysis and malware detection. However, efficient binary decompilation is challenging. Conventional decompilers have the following major limitations: (i) they are only applicable to specific source-target language pair, hence incurs undesired development cost for new language tasks; (ii) their output high-level code cannot effectively preserve the correct functionality of the input binary; (iii) their output program does not capture the semantics of the input and the reversed program is hard to interpret. To address the above problems, we propose Coda, the first end-to-end neural-based framework for code decompilation. Coda decomposes the decompilation task into two key phases: First, Coda employs an instruction type-aware encoder and a tree decoder for generating an abstract syntax tree (AST) with attention feeding during the code sketch generation stage. Second, Coda then updates the code sketch using an iterative error correction machine guided by an ensembled neural error predictor. By finding a good approximate candidate and then fixing it towards perfect, Coda achieves superior performance compared to baseline approaches. We assess Coda's performance with extensive experiments on various benchmarks. Evaluation results show that Coda achieves an average of 82\% program recovery accuracy on unseen binary samples, where the state-of-the-art decompilers yield 0\% accuracy. Furthermore, Coda outperforms the sequence-to-sequence model with attention by a margin of 70\% program accuracy. },

Recently, researchers have proposed using techniques from neural machine translation to automate the process in decompilation. Although such techniques hold the promise of targeting a wider range of source and assembly languages, to date they have primarily targeted C code. In this paper we argue that existing neural decompilers have achieved higher accuracy at the cost of requiring language-specific domain knowledge such as tokenizers and parsers to build an abstract syntax tree (AST) for the source language, which increases the overhead of supporting new languages. We explore a different tradeoff that, to the extent possible, treats the assembly and source languages as plain text, and show that this allows us to build a decompiler that is easily retargetable to new languages. We evaluate our prototype decompiler, Beyond The C (BTC), on Go, Fortran, OCaml, and C, and examine the impact of parameters such as tokenization and training data selection on the quality of decompilation, finding that it achieves comparable decompilation results to prior work in neural decompilation with significantly less domain knowledge. We will release our training data, trained decompilation models, and code to help encourage future research into language-agnostic decompilation. },

The problem of decompilation is extremely important for security researchers. Finding vulnerabilities and understanding how malware operates is much easier when done over source code. The importance of decompilation has motivated the construction of hand-crafted rule-based decompilers. Such decompilers have been designed by experts to detect specific control-flow structures and idioms in low-level code and lift them to source level. The cost of supporting additional languages or new language features in these models is very high. We present a novel approach to decompilation based on neural machine translation. The main idea is to automatically learn a decompiler from a given compiler. Given a compiler from a source language S to a target language T , our approach automatically trains a decompiler that can translate (decompile) T back to S . We used our framework to decompile both LLVM IR and x86 assembly to C code with high success rates. Using our LLVM and x86 instantiations, we were able to successfully decompile over 97% and 88% of our benchmarks respectively. },

However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf\{19,448\} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \textbf\{19\} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation. },

It has been widely used when analysts perform security analysis on software (systems) whose source code is unavailable, such as vulnerability search and malware analysis. However, current decompilation tools usually need lots of experts' efforts, even for years, to generate the rules for decompilation, which also requires long-term maintenance as the syntax of high-level PL or low-level PL changes. Also, an ideal decompiler should concisely generate high-level PL with similar functionality to the source low-level PL and semantic information (e.g., meaningful variable names), just like human-written code. Unfortunately, existing manually-defined rule-based decompilation techniques only functionally restore the low-level PL to a similar high-level PL and are still powerless to recover semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel neural decompilation approach to translate low-level PL into accurate and user-friendly high-level PL, effectively improving its readability and understandability. Furthermore, we implement the proposed approaches called SEAM. Evaluations on four real-world applications show that SEAM has an average accuracy of 94.41%, which is much better than prior neural machine translation (NMT) models. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of semantic information recovery through a questionnaire survey, and the average accuracy is 92.64%, which is comparable or superior to the state-of-the-art compilers. },

We present BTD (Bin to DNN), a decompiler for deep neural network (DNN) executables. BTD takes DNN executables and outputs full model specifications, including types of DNN operators, network topology, dimensions, and parameters that are (nearly) identical to those of the input models. BTD delivers a practical framework to process DNN executables compiled by different DL compilers and with full optimizations enabled on x86 platforms. It employs learning-based techniques to infer DNN operators, dynamic analysis to reveal network architectures, and symbolic execution to facilitate inferring dimensions and parameters of DNN operators. Our evaluation reveals that BTD enables accurate recovery of full specifications of complex DNNs with millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet). The recovered DNN specifications can be re-compiled into a new DNN executable exhibiting identical behavior to the input executable. We show that BTD can boost two representative attacks, adversarial example generation and knowledge stealing, against DNN executables.

However, existing LLM-based approaches face several critical challenges, including limited capability in reconstructing code structure and logic, low accuracy in data recovery, concerns over data security and privacy, and high computational resource requirements. To address these issues, we develop the CodeInverter Suite, making three contributions: (1) the CodeInverter Workflow (CIW) is a novel prompt engineering workflow that incorporates control flow graphs (CFG) and explicit data mappings to improve LLM-based decompilation. (2) Using CIW on well-known source code datasets, we curate the CodeInverter Dataset (CID), a domain-specific dataset containing 8.69 million samples that contains CFGs and data mapping tables. (3) We train the CoderInverter Models (CIMs) on CID, generating two lightweight LLMs (with 1.3B and 6.7B parameters) intended for efficient inference in privacy-sensitive or resource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that the CIW substantially enhances the performance of various LLMs across multiple metrics.

  abstract = {Blockchain systems are increasingly targeted by on-chain attacks that exploit contract vulnerabilities to extract value rapidly and stealthily, making systematic analysis and reproduction highly challenging. In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months. TracExp successfully synthesizes PoCs for 93% of incidents, with 58.78% being directly verifiable, at an average cost of only \$0.07 per case. Moreover, TracExp enabled the release of a large number of previously unavailable PoCs to the community, earning a $900 bounty and demonstrating strong practical impact. },

  abstract = {In this paper, we leverage low-level compiler intermediate representations (IR) to improve code translation. Traditional transpilers rely on syntactic information and handcrafted rules, which limits their applicability and produces unnatural-looking code. Applying neural machine translation (NMT) approaches to code has successfully broadened the set of programs on which one can get a natural-looking translation. However, they treat the code as sequences of text tokens, and still do not differentiate well enough between similar pieces of code which have different semantics in different languages. The consequence is low quality translation, reducing the practicality of NMT, and stressing the need for an approach significantly increasing its accuracy. Here we propose to augment code translation with IRs, specifically LLVM IR, with results on the C++, Java, Rust, and Go languages. Our method improves upon the state of the art for unsupervised code translation, increasing the number of correct translations by 11% on average, and up to 79% for the Java -> Rust pair with greedy decoding. We extend previous test sets for code translation, by adding hundreds of Go and Rust functions. Additionally, we train models with high performance on the problem of IR decompilation, generating programming source code from IR, and study using IRs as intermediary pivot for translation. },

Motivated by the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose LLM4Decompile, the first and largest open-source LLM series (1.3B to 33B) trained to decompile binary code. We optimize the LLM training process and introduce the LLM4Decompile-End models to decompile binary directly. The resulting models significantly outperform GPT-4o and Ghidra on the HumanEval and ExeBench benchmarks by over 100% in terms of re-executability rate. Additionally, we improve the standard refinement approach to fine-tune the LLM4Decompile-Ref models, enabling them to effectively refine the decompiled code from Ghidra and achieve a further 16.2% improvement over the LLM4Decompile-End. LLM4Decompile demonstrates the potential of LLMs to revolutionize binary code decompilation, delivering remarkable improvements in readability and executability while complementing conventional tools for optimal results.

  abstract = {Recent advances in LLM-based decompilers have been shown effective to convert low-level binaries into human-readable source code. However, there still lacks a comprehensive benchmark that provides large-scale binary-source function pairs, which is critical for advancing the LLM decompilation technology. Creating accurate binary-source mappings incurs severe issues caused by complex compilation settings and widespread function inlining that obscure the correspondence between binaries and their original source code. Previous efforts have either relied on used contest-style benchmarks, synthetic binary-source mappings that diverge significantly from the mappings in real world, or partially matched binaries with only code lines or variable names, compromising the effectiveness of analyzing the binary functionality. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Decompile-Bench, the first open-source dataset comprising two million binary-source function pairs condensed from 100 million collected function pairs, i.e., 450GB of binaries compiled from permissively licensed GitHub projects. For the evaluation purposes, we also developed a benchmark Decompile-Bench-Eval including manually crafted binaries from the well-established HumanEval and MBPP, alongside the compiled GitHub repositories released after 2025 to mitigate data leakage issues. We further explore commonly-used evaluation metrics to provide a thorough assessment of the studied LLM decompilers and find that fine-tuning with Decompile-Bench causes a 20% improvement over previous benchmarks in terms of the re-executability rate.

  abstract = {Recently, the transformer architecture has enabled substantial progress in many areas of pattern recognition and machine learning. However, as with other neural network models, there is currently no general method available to explain their inner workings. The present paper represents a first step towards this direction. We utilize \textit\{Transformer Compiler for RASP\} (Tracr) to generate a large dataset of pairs of transformer weights and corresponding RASP programs. Based on this dataset, we then build and train a model, with the aim of recovering the RASP code from the compiled model. We demonstrate that the simple form of Tracr compiled transformer weights is interpretable for such a decompiler model. In an empirical evaluation, our model achieves exact reproductions on more than 30\% of the test objects, while the remaining 70\% can generally be reproduced with only few errors. Additionally, more than 70\% of the programs, produced by our model, are functionally equivalent to the ground truth, and therefore a valid decompilation of the Tracr compiled transformer weights. },

  abstract = {A C decompiler converts an executable into source code. The recovered C source code, once re-compiled, is expected to produce an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. With over twenty years of development, C decompilers have been widely used in production to support reverse engineering applications. Despite the prosperous development of C decompilers, it is widely acknowledged that decompiler outputs are mainly used for human consumption, and are not suitable for automatic recompilation. Often, a substantial amount of manual effort is required to fix the decompiler outputs before they can be recompiled and executed properly. This paper is motived by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in comprehending dense corpus of natural language. To alleviate the tedious, costly and often error-prone manual effort in fixing decompiler outputs, we investigate the feasibility of using LLMs to augment decompiler outputs, thus delivering recompilable decompilation. Note that different from previous efforts that focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with higher readability (e.g., recovering type/variable names), we focus on augmenting decompiler outputs with recompilability, meaning to generate code that can be recompiled into an executable with the same functionality as the original executable. We conduct a pilot study to characterize the obstacles in recompiling the outputs of the de facto commercial C decompiler -- IDA-Pro. We then propose a two-step, hybrid approach to augmenting decompiler outputs with LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a set of popular C test cases, and show that our approach can deliver a high recompilation success rate to over 75% with moderate effort, whereas none of the IDA-Pro's original outputs can be recompiled. We conclude with a discussion on the limitations of our approach and promising future research directions. },

  abstract = {Decompilation aims to analyze and transform low-level program language
(PL) codes such as binary code or assembly code to obtain an equivalent
high-level PL. Decompilation plays a vital role in the cyberspace
security fields such as software vulnerability discovery and analysis,
malicious code detection and analysis, and software engineering fields
such as source code analysis, optimization, and cross-language
cross-operating system migration. Unfortunately, the existing
decompilers mainly rely on experts to write rules, which leads to
bottlenecks such as low scalability, development difficulties, and long
cycles. The generated high-level PL codes often violate the code writing
specifications. Further, their readability is still relatively low. The
problems mentioned above hinder the efficiency of advanced applications
(e.g., vulnerability discovery) based on decompiled high-level PL
codes.In this paper, we propose a decompilation approach based on the
attention-based neural machine translation (NMT) mechanism, which
converts low-level PL into high-level PL while acquiring legibility and
keeping functionally similar. To compensate for the information
asymmetry between the low-level and high-level PL, a translation method
based on basic operations of low-level PL is designed. This method
improves the generalization of the NMT model and captures the
translation rules between PLs more accurately and efficiently. Besides,
we implement a neural decompilation framework called Neutron. The
evaluation of two practical applications shows that Neutron's average
program accuracy is 96.96\%, which is better than the traditional NMT

  abstract = {Much software, whether beneficent or malevolent, is distributed only as
binaries, sans source code. Absent source code, understanding binaries'
behavior can be quite challenging, especially when compiled under higher
levels of compiler optimization. These optimizations can transform
comprehensible, ``natural{''} source constructions into something
entirely unrecognizable. Reverse engineering binaries, especially those
suspected of being malevolent or guilty of intellectual property theft,
are important and time-consuming tasks. There is a great deal of
interest in tools to ``decompile{''} binaries back into more natural
source code to aid reverse engineering. Decompilation involves several
desirable steps, including recreating source-language constructions,
variable names, and perhaps even comments. One central step in creating
binaries is optimizing function calls, using steps such as inlining.
Recovering these (possibly inlined) function calls from optimized
binaries is an essential task that most state-of-the-art decompiler
tools try to do but do not perform very well. In this paper, we evaluate
a supervised learning approach to the problem of recovering optimized
function calls. We leverage open-source software and develop an
automated labeling scheme to generate a reasonably large dataset of
binaries labeled with actual function usages. We augment this large but
limited labeled dataset with a pre-training step, which learns the
decompiled code statistics from a much larger unlabeled dataset. Thus
augmented, our learned labeling model can be combined with an existing
decompilation tool, Ghidra, to achieve substantially improved
performance in function call recovery, especially at higher levels of
optimization.},

  abstract = {The decompiler is one of the most common tools for examining executable
binaries without the corresponding source code. It transforms binaries
into high-level code, reversing the compilation process. Unfortunately,
decompiler output is far from readable because the decompilation process
is often incomplete. State-of-the-art techniques use machine learning to
predict missing information like variable names. While these approaches
are often able to suggest good variable names in context, no existing
work examines how the selection of training data influences these
machine learning models. We investigate how data provenance and the
quality of training data affect performance, and how well, if at all,
trained models generalize across software domains. We focus on the
variable renaming problem using one such machine learning model, DIRE.
We first describe DIRE in detail and the accompanying technique used to
generate training data from raw code. We also evaluate DIRE's overall
performance without respect to data quality. Next, we show how training
on more popular, possibly higher quality code (measured using GitHub
stars) leads to a more generalizable model because popular code tends to
have more diverse variable names. Finally, we evaluate how well DIRE
predicts domain-specific identifiers, propose a modification to
incorporate domain information, and show that it can predict identifiers
in domain-specific scenarios 23\% more frequently than the original DIRE
model.},

  abstract = {Decompiler is a specialized type of reverse engineering tool extensively
employed in program analysis tasks, particularly in program
comprehension and vulnerability detection. However, current Solidity
smart contract decompilers face significant limitations in
reconstructing the original source code. In particular, the bottleneck
of SOTA decompilers lies in inaccurate function identification,
incorrect variable type recovery, and missing contract attributes. These
deficiencies hinder downstream tasks and understanding of the program
logic. To address these challenges, we propose SmartHalo, a new
framework that enhances decompiler output by combining static analysis
(SA) and large language models (LLM). SmartHalo leverages the
complementary strengths of SA's accuracy in control and data flow
analysis and LLM's capability in semantic prediction. More specifically,
SmartHalo constructs a new data structure - Dependency Graph (DG), to
extract semantic dependencies via static analysis. Then, it takes DG to
create prompts for LLM optimization. Finally, the correctness of LLM
outputs is validated through symbolic execution and formal verification.
Evaluation on a dataset consisting of 465 randomly selected smart
contract functions shows that SmartHalo significantly improves the
quality of the decompiled code, compared to SOTA decompilers (e.g.,
Gigahorse). Notably, integrating GPT-4o mini with SmartHalo further
enhances its performance, achieving a precision of 91.32\% and a recall
of 87.38\% for function boundaries, a precision of 90.40\% and a recall
of 88.82\% for variable types, and a precision of 80.66\% and a recall
of 91.78\% for contract attributes.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have undergone rapid evolution and achieved remarkable results in recent times. OpenAI's ChatGPT, backed by GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, has gained instant popularity due to its strong capability across a wide range of tasks, including natural language tasks, coding, mathematics, and engaging conversations. However, the impacts and limits of such LLMs in system security domain are less explored. In this paper, we delve into the limits of LLMs (i.e., ChatGPT) in seven software security applications including vulnerability detection/repair, debugging, debloating, decompilation, patching, root cause analysis, symbolic execution, and fuzzing. Our exploration reveals that ChatGPT not only excels at generating code, which is the conventional application of language models, but also demonstrates strong capability in understanding user-provided commands in natural languages, reasoning about control and data flows within programs, generating complex data structures, and even decompiling assembly code. Notably, GPT-4 showcases significant improvements over GPT-3.5 in most security tasks. Also, certain limitations of ChatGPT in security-related tasks are identified, such as its constrained ability to process long code contexts. },

@article{Xie2025,
  abstract = {Demonstrating quantum advantage using conventional quantum algorithms remains challenging on current noisy gate-based quantum computers. Automated quantum circuit synthesis via quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution, employing trainable parametric quantum circuits to alleviate this. The circuit ansatz in these solutions is often designed through reinforcement learning-based quantum architecture search when the domain knowledge of the problem and hardware are not effective. However, the interpretability of these synthesized circuits remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their scalability and applicability across diverse problem domains. This work addresses the challenge of explainability in quantum architecture search (QAS) by introducing a novel genetic programming-based decompiler framework for reverse-engineering high-level quantum algorithms from low-level circuit representations. The proposed approach, implemented in the open-source tool DeQompile, employs program synthesis techniques, including symbolic regression and abstract syntax tree manipulation, to distill interpretable Qiskit algorithms from quantum assembly language. Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating the decompiler with online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms. },

@article{Zou2025,
  abstract = {As one of the key tools in many security tasks, decompilers reconstruct human-readable source code from binaries. Yet, despite recent advances, their outputs often suffer from syntactic and semantic errors and remain difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanced decompiler-LLM pipeline with a fine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: preserving accuracy while improving readability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality assessment system to score the decompiled source code from multiple aspects, and use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best output during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the quality of 68.2% of all the functions produced by the native decompiler. },
